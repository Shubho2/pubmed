This study aims to report radiotherapyutilization and fractionation patterns during the first course of cancertreatment.METHODS: We extracted all solid tumor cases from 2004 to 2014 in the NationalCancer Data Base, which captures only the first course of treatment. Patientswere subcategorized by disease site: breast, central nervous system (CNS),gastrointestinal, genitourinary, gynecologic, head and neck (HN),musculoskeletal, skin, or thoracic. Receipt of therapy was identified (systemic, surgical, or radiation therapy). Radiotherapy was subcategorized as external beamradiation therapy (EBRT) (conventional and stereotactic), brachytherapy, andradio-isotopes. Radiotherapy was also characterized by intent (palliative ordefinitive). The percent of patients receiving therapy and in those receivingradiotherapy, the mean number of radiation treatments, or fractions, deliveredover time were reported.RESULTS: The utilization of radiotherapy among all cases declined from 33.9% to31.2% (P < .001), and systemic therapy and surgical therapy use went from 37.3%to 44.1% (P < .001) and 67.7% to 67.5% (P = .79), respectively. Radiotherapyutilization decreased most in genitourinary, HN, and CNS cases with relativedeclines of -42.5% (-12.4% absolute decrease, P < .001), -10.3% (-6.1%, P <.001), and -9.6% (-3.2%, P = .001), respectively. Radiotherapy utilizationincreased in gastrointestinal (+0.6% absolute increase, P < .001),musculoskeletal (+1.0%, P = .002), skin (+0.7%, P = .002), and thoracic (+0.1%,P = .46) malignancies. In patients receiving EBRT, the mean number of fractionsdelivered per patient declined from 28.7 to 25.2 (P < .001); declines wereevident in all disease sites but CNS.CONCLUSION: We found a steady decrease in the percent of patients receivingradiotherapy in their first course of treatment, and a global decline in the meannumber of fractions delivered per patient receiving EBRT, compared with anincrease in systemic therapy and stable surgery utilization. These resultsillustrate the changing use of radiotherapy and fractionation during first-linetherapy in contemporary US cancer care.Copyright © 2018 American College of Radiology.
