Microscopy with ultraviolet surface excitation (MUSE) is a low-costoptical sectioning technique using ultraviolet illumination which limitsfluorescence excitation to the specimen surface. In this paper, we characterizeMUSE using high incident angle, water immersion illumination to improvesectioning. Propidium iodide is used as a nuclear stain and eosin yellow as acounterstain. Histologic features of specimens using MUSE, nonlinear microscopy(NLM) and conventional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology were evaluated bypathologists to assess potential application in Mohs surgery for skin cancer and lumpectomy for breast cancer. MUSE images of basal cell carcinoma showed highcorrespondence with frozen section H&E histology, suggesting that MUSE may beapplicable to Mohs surgery. However, correspondence in breast tissue between MUSEand paraffin embedded H&E histology was limited due to the thicker opticalsectioning in MUSE, suggesting that further development is needed for breastsurgical applications. We further demonstrate that the transverse imageresolution of MUSE is limited by the optical sectioning thickness and useco-registered NLM to quantify the improvement in MUSE optical sectioning fromhigh incident angle water immersion illumination.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22264-2 PMCID: PMC5852098PMID: 29540700
