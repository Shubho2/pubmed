Multipleevidences revealed that a large number of microRNAs and mRNAs were abnormallyexpressed in thyroid cancer tissues. These microRNAs and mRNAs play importantroles in tumorigenesis. In the present study, we identified 72 microRNAs and1,766 mRNAs differentially expressed between thyroid cancer tissues and normalthyroid tissues and evaluated their prognostic values using Kaplan-Meier survivalcurves by log-rank test. Seven microRNAs (miR-146b, miR-184, miR-767, miR-6730,miR-6860, miR-196a-2 and miR-509-3) were associated with the overall survival.Among them, three microRNAs were linked with six differentially expressed mRNAs(miR-767 was predicted to target COL10A1, PLAG1 and PPP1R1C; miR-146b waspredicted to target MMP16; miR-196a-2 was predicted to target SYT9). To identify the key genes in the protein-protein interaction network , we screened out thetop 10 hub genes (NPY, NMU, KNG1, LPAR5, CCR3, SST, PPY, GABBR2, ADCY8 and SAA1) with higher degrees. Only LPAR5 was associated with the overall survival.Multivariate analysis demonstrated that miR-184, miR-146b, miR-509-3 and LPAR5were an independent risk factors for prognosis. Our results of the present study identified a series of prognostic microRNAs and mRNAs that have the potential to be the targets for treatment of thyroid cancer.DOI: 10.7717/peerj.4674 PMCID: PMC5937477PMID: 29740512
