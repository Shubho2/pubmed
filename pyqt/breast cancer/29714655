A series of diagnostichypotheses should be considered, not only focusing on cutaneous metastasis, butalso on dermatologic and systemic diseases.CASE REPORT: In February 2015, a 37-year-old patient underwent a rightsubcutaneous mastectomy for stage IIA breast cancer. Five months after beginning adjuvant chemotherapy, she noted hyperpigmentation and thickening of the skin on the right breast. Differential diagnosis included local relapse, skin infection, lymphoma, or primary cutaneous disease, and a skin biopsy was performed. Thehistopathologic specimen showed full-thickness sclerosis, with features oflocalized morphea. Therapy with clobetasol was prescribed, with progressiveresolution of the thickness. The collaboration between many professionals in amultidisciplinary team (oncologist, dermatologist, plastic surgeon, andpathologist) was crucial to achieving the diagnosis.CONCLUSION: In the literature, some articles describe correlation betweenconnective tissue diseases and silicone breast implants, but the pathogeneticmechanisms are unknown. We report a rare case of breast morphea after positioninga silicone implant in a patient who had undergone mastectomy. This clinicalreport represents an interesting model of multidisciplinary management of apatient with breast cancer who developed an uncommon dermatologic disease.Further studies are needed to clarify the association between silicone implantsand breast morphea.DOI: 10.1177/0300891618763209 PMID: 29714655
