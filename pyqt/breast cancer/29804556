[Epub ahead of print]Up-regulation of HOXB cluster genes are epigenetically regulated intamoxifen-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cells.Yang S, Lee JY, Hur H, Oh JH, Kim MH(1).Author information: (1)Department of Anatomy, Embryology Laboratory, and Brain Korea 21 PLUS project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Korea.Tamoxifen (TAM) is commonly used to treat estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Despite the remarkable benefits, resistance to TAM presents a serioustherapeutic challenge. Since several HOX transcription factors have been proposedas strong candidates in the development of resistance to TAM therapy in breastcancer, we generated an in vitro model of acquired TAM resistance usingER-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells (MCF7-TAMR), and analyzed the expressionpattern and epigenetic states of HOX genes. HOXB cluster genes were uniquelyup-regulated in MCF7-TAMR cells. Survival analysis of in slico data showed thecorrelation of high expression of HOXB genes with poor response to TAM inER-positive breast cancer patients treated with TAM. Gain- and loss-of-functionexperiments showed that the overexpression of multi HOXB genes in MCF7 renderscancer cells more resistant to TAM, whereas the knockdown restores TAMsensitivity. Furthermore, activation of HOXB genes in MCF7-TAMR was associatedwith histone modifications, particularly the gain of H3K9ac. These findings implythat the activation of HOXB genes mediate the development of TAM resistance, and represent a target for development of new strategies to prevent or reverse TAMresistance.PMID: 29804556
