Electronic address: Marioromanach@ufrj.br.Oral and maxillofacial metastatic tumors are uncommon, with the breast, prostate,lung, and kidney representing the most common primary sites. Less than 1% of all breast cancers occur in male patients, and to date, only 8 cases of metastaticbreast adenocarcinoma to the oral and maxillofacial region in a male patient havebeen reported in the literature. An 88-year-old male with previous history of asuccessfully treated primary breast adenocarcinoma 12 years earlier was referred for evaluation of an oral swelling lasting 6 months. Intraoral examinationrevealed a 2-cm reddish, pedunculated nodule with a smooth surface located in theleft retromolar region. Imaging revealed maxillary sinus involvement. The patientunderwent incisional biopsy, and microscopic evaluation revealed invasive tumorislands compounded by malignant epithelial cells, sometimes exhibiting ductalarrangement, which were positive for the estrogen receptor and gross cysticdisease fluid protein 15. The final diagnosis was metastatic breastadenocarcinoma. Breast metastases are exceedingly rare in the oral andmaxillofacial region of male patients; however, clinicians should consider breastmetastasis when evaluating reddish oral nodules in older patients, including men,especially those with a history of malignancy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
