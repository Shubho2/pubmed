Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) werecalculated and compared between the patients with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and < 25 kg/m2in all patients and in specific subgroups, including tumor subtype, metabolicsyndrome, and systemic treatment.RESULTS: In all patients, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 was an unfavorable factor for OS (P =.030) but not for DFS. In the HR+/HER2- subgroup, DFS and OS were longer inpatients with BMI < 25 kg/m2 than ≥ 25 kg/m2 (P = .012 and .005, respectively).In patients with more than one metabolic syndrome, BMI was an unfavorable factor for OS (hazard ratio, 2.669; P < .001) CONCLUSION: BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 was anunfavorable survival factor, particularly in patients with HR+/HER2- breastcancer.Copyright © 2018.
