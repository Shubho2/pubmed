Pregnancies were included up to end of 2014. Females from the exposed groupnot pregnant before cancer diagnosis (n = 10 271) were compared with generalpopulation controls matched for age, deprivation quintile and year of diagnosis.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Scottish Cancer Registry records werelinked to hospital discharge records to calculate standardized incidence ratios(SIR) for pregnancy, standardized for age and year of diagnosis. Linkage to deathrecords was also performed. We also selected women from the exposed group who hadnot been pregnant prior to their cancer diagnosis who were compared with amatched control group from the general population. Additional analyses wereperformed for breast cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, leukaemia, cervical cancer andbrain/CNS cancers.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Cancer survivors achieved fewer pregnancies:SIR 0.62 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.63). Reduced SIR was observed for all cancer types. Thechance of achieving a first pregnancy was also lower, adjusted hazard ratio =0.57 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.61) for women >5 years after diagnosis, with markedreductions in women with breast, cervical and brain/CNS tumours, and leukaemia.The effect was reduced with more recent treatment period overall and in cervical cancer, breast cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma, but was unchanged for leukaemia orbrain/CNS cancers. The proportion of pregnancies that ended in termination waslower after a cancer diagnosis, and the proportion ending in live birth washigher (78.7 vs 75.6%, CI of difference: 1.1, 5.0).LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Details of treatments received were notavailable, so the impact of specific treatment regimens on fertility could not beassessed. Limited duration of follow-up was available for women diagnosed in the most recent time period.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This analysis provides population-basedquantification by cancer type of the effect of cancer and its treatment onsubsequent pregnancy across the reproductive age range, and how this has changed in recent decades. The demonstration of a reduced chance of pregnancy across all cancer types and the changing impact in some but not other common cancershighlights the need for appropriate fertility counselling of all females ofreproductive age at diagnosis.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was funded by NHS Lothian Cancer and Leukaemia Endowments Fund.
