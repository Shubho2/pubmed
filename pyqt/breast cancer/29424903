In the present study, we aimed to explore the association between miR-597 expression level and prognosis of BC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression levels of miR-597 were measured usingquantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Theassociation between miR-597 expression and clinicopathological factors wasanalyzed. Differences in BC patient survival were determined using theKaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The prognostic value of miR-597 wasfurther verified using the Cox proportional hazards regression model.RESULTS: Our data indicated that miR-597 was lowly expressed in BC compared with adjacent non-malignant tissues (p<0.001). Low miR-597 expression was observed to be closely associated with positive lymph node metastasis (p=0.001), higher TNMstage (p = 0.003), and poorer pathological differentiation (p=0.006).Furthermore, patients with lower levels of miR-597 expression had a shorteroverall survival time than patients with higher miR-597 expression levels(p=0.009). In addition, multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysisconfirmed that miR-597 was an independent prognostic indicator of overallsurvival (p=0.005; HR 2.273; CI 95%, 1.117-4.291).CONCLUSIONS: We showed, for the first time, that decreased miR-597 expressionsuggested unfavorable prognosis for BC patients.PMID: 29424903
