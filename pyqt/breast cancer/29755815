Epub2017 Nov 29.Late Endobronchial Pulmonary Metastasis in a Patient with Breast Cancer.Çoşğun İG(1), Kaçan T(2), Erten G(3).Author information: (1)Department of Pulmonology, Afyonkarahisar State Hospital, Afyonkarahisar,Turkey.(2)Department of Oncology, Afyonkarahisar State Hospital, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey.(3)Department of Pathology, Afyonkarahisar State Hospital, Afyonkarahisar,Turkey.The lung is a common location for malignant metastases. However, endobronchialmetastases from nonpulmonary neoplasms are rare. Metastatic breast cancer usuallyoccurs in 2-3 years of the disease course. A 65-year-old woman visited ourhospital for the evaluation of dry cough. The patient had a history of breastcancer, which was treated with modified radical mastectomy and axillarydissection 10 years ago; she was then treated with aromatase inhibitor for 5years. Chest X-ray revealed right hilum enlargement. Thorax computed tomographyrevealed a 35-mm diameter mass that was localized in the right hilum. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed, and an endobronchial lesion was observed in the rightmain lobe carina. Pathological evaluation revealed that the mass was a metastasisof the invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Weekly paklitaxel chemotherapywas initiated because of the symptomatic disease. We reported the case of apatient with breast cancer who had an endobronchial metastasis. Her disease-free interval was 10 years. This case indicates that a long-term follow-up of breastcancer is necessary, and biopsies must be performed to make a final diagnosiswhen any suspicious hilum enlargement is observed.DOI: 10.5152/TurkThoracJ.2017.17021 PMCID: PMC5937818PMID: 29755815
