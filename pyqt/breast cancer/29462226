Patients were exactly matched (1:1) based on age, gender, state ofresidence, and insurance plan type. Prevalence of cancer was compared betweencohorts over patients' last 12 months of continuous healthcare plan enrollmentusing logistic-regression models.RESULTS: A total of 179,066 pairs of Ps and Ps-free patients were selected.Median age was 54.0 years, 51.7% were females. Prevalence of cancer was higheramong Ps patients for any type of neoplasms (OR [95% confidence interval(CI)]=1.86 [1.83; 1.89]), malignant neoplasms (OR [95% CI]=1.53 [1.49;1.57]), as well as malignant skin neoplasms (OR [95% CI]=1.87 [1.79; 1.95]), lymphatic andhematopoietic tissues (OR [95% CI]=1.70 [1.57;1.84]), genital (OR [95% CI]=1.33[1.26;1.41]), breast (OR [95% CI]=1.32 [1.24;1.40]), digestive organs andperitoneum (OR [95% CI]=1.24 [1.13;1.35]), urinary organs (OR [95% CI]=1.49[1.36;1.64]), respiratory and intrathoracic organs (OR [95% CI]=1.30[1.17;1.44]), and metastatic cancer (OR [95% CI]=1.14 [1.06;1.24]), all P lessthan 0.01.LIMITATIONS: Impact of Ps severity could not be assessed.CONCLUSION: Ps patients had a higher prevalence of cancer than Ps-free patients.
