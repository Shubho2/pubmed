Four of the isolates,Cod-KK1634, Cod-KK1643, Cod-KS1601, and Cod-SN1626, had activity against the teststrains of Grampositive bacteria. Of these 4 extracts, the Cod-KK1643 extract hadthe lowest minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations. The Cod-KK1643extract exhibited both concentration- and time-dependent bactericidal activity.Moreover, the Cod-KK1643 extract induced morphological alterations in bacterialcells, including decreased cell size, a crushed appearance, and cell lysis. It issurprising to note that the extracts also inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation,with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 47.09 Â± 33.64 mg/mL after 72hours. The extracts also inhibited MCF-7 cell migration, with the lowestpercentage of relative closure achieved with Cod-KK1643. These findings representwhat is to our knowledge the first information on the activities of O. soboliferamycelial extracts against bacteria and the human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line.DOI: 10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.2018026247 PMID: 29953362
