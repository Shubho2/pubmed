Electronic address:profwjh@126.com.Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) plays a key role in eukaryotic cell cycleprogression which could facilitate the transition from G1 to S phase. Thedysregulation of CDK2 is closely related to many cancers. CDK2 is utilized as oneof the most studied kinase targets in oncology. In this article, 24 benzamidederivatives were designed, synthesized and investigated for the inhibitionactivity against CDK2. Our results revealed that the compound 25 is a potent CDK2inhibitor exhibiting a broad spectrum anti-proliferative activity against severalhuman breast cancer cells. Additionally, compound 25 could block cell cycle at G0or G1 and induce significant apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells. These findingshighlight a rationale for further development of CDK2 inhibitors to treat humanbreast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2018.05.024 PMID: 29853338
