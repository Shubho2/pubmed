Everolimus (EVE) amelioratesAI-resistant breast cancer and is therefore used in cancer treatment. However,some patients show resistance to EVE. Here, we used 30 clones of long-termestrogen-deprived (LTED) MCF-7 cells as a model of AI-resistant breast cancer. Weexamined changes in protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) and cancerous inhibitor ofPP2A (CIP2A), a negative regulator of PP2A, in LTED cells treated with EVE. InLTED cells with high sensitivity to EVE, CIP2A expression decreased at low EVEconcentrations; however, in LTED cells poorly sensitive to EVE, CIP2A and PP2Adid not change upon exposure to EVE. Therefore, we hypothesized that there is arelation between expression of CIP2A and sensitivity to EVE. Knockdown of CIP2Aincreased the sensitivity to EVE in three clones poorly sensitive to EVE.Additionally, we found that treatment with FSK, which activates PP2A, increasedthe sensitivity of the cells to EVE. Our data point to CIP2A and PP2A as noveltherapeutic targets for AI-resistant breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25217 PMCID: PMC5955115PMID: 29805747
