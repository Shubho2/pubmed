Performance of radiologists as single readers was compared toexpected double reading performance. We theoretically evaluated all possiblepairing methodologies. Bootstrap resampling methods were used for statisticalanalyses.RESULTS: Significant improvements in expected performance for double versussingle reading (ie, delta performance) were shown for all performance measuresand case-sets (p ≤ .003), with overall delta performance across all theoreticallypossible pairing schemes (n = 10,395) ranging between .05 and .08. Deltaperformance for the 20 best pairing schemes was significant (p < .001) and rangedbetween .07 and .10. Delta performance for 20 random pairing schemes was alsosignificant (p ≤ .003) and ranged between .05 and .08. Delta performance for the 20 worst pairing schemes ranged between .03 and .06, reaching significance indelta proportion correct (p ≤ .021) for all three case-sets and in deltaspecificity for two case-sets (p ≤ .033) but not for a third case-set (p = .131),and not reaching significance in delta sensitivity for any of the three case-sets(.098 ≥ p ≥ .067).CONCLUSION: Significant benefits accrue from double reading, and while randomreader pairing achieves most double reading benefits, a strategic pairingapproach may maximize the benefits of double reading.Copyright © 2018.
