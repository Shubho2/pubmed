The high mortality might be attributed todelay in detection and is closely related to lymph node metastasis. Therefore, itis of great importance to explore the mechanism of lymph node metastasis and findstrategies to block GC metastasis. Messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA) andlong non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression data and clinical data were downloadedfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A total of 908 differentiallyexpressed factors with variance >0.5 including 542 genes, 42 miRNA, and 324lncRNA were screened using significant analysis microarray algorithm, andinteraction networks were constructed using these differentially expressedfactors. Furthermore, we conducted functional modules analysis in the network,and found that yellow and turquoise modules could separate samples efficiently.The groups classified in the yellow and turquoise modules had a significantdifference in survival time, which was verified in another independent GC mRNAdataset (GSE62254). The results suggested that differentially expressed factorsin the yellow and turquoise modules may participate in lymph node metastasis ofGC and could be applied as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for GC.DOI: 10.1590/1414-431x20176685 PMCID: PMC5856436PMID: 29489999  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
