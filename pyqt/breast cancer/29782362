The aim of thisstudy was to determine whether patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapyhave equal survival after breast-conservation therapy compared with mastectomy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using the New Jersey State Cancer Registry (NJSCR) patientswith a primary breast cancer diagnosed between 1998 and 2003 who underwentneoadjuvant chemotherapy were selected (n=1,468). Of those, only patients whoreceived lumpectomy plus radiation (n=276) or mastectomy without radiation(n=442) were included in the analysis. The main outcome measured included 10-yearbreast cancer-specific mortality, with 90% of patients with known vital statusthrough the end of 2011.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between thebreast-conservation and mastectomy without radiation groups except with respectto summary stage and lymph node involvement. After propensity score matchingthese differences were no longer statistically significant; however, bothestrogen and progesterone status achieved statistical significance. TheKaplan-Meier survival curve showed that the breast-conservation group hadsignificantly higher breast cancer-specific survival than the mastectomy group(P=0.0046). After adjusting for the propensity score in the regression model, thebreast-conservation group continued to show significantly better survival thanthe mastectomy group (hazard ratios, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.78).CONCLUSIONS: This study is consistent with previous research showing thatbreast-conserving surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not reduce breastcancer-specific survival. In fact, patients undergoing breast-conservation after neoadjuvant therapy appeared to have better survival than patients undergoingmastectomy without radiation.DOI: 10.1097/COC.0000000000000456 PMID: 29782362
