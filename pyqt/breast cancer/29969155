Prostate-derived ETS factor (PDEF) is highly restricted to the hormone-regulated tissues of epithelial cells, such as those inthe prostate, breast and other tissues. It has been demonstrated that PDEFexpression is associated with AR in prostate cancer. In this research, we aimedto investigate the relationship between PDEF and AR in ER- BC.METHODS AND RESULTS: We immunohistochemically evaluated the correlation betweenPDEF and AR expression in 246 cases of ER- invasive BC, and investigated theirrelationship in ER- BC cell lines. The expression of PDEF was associated with thepositive expression of AR (P <0.001) and a worse survival rate (P = 0.006). PDEF+tumours were significantly more often AR+ (P <0.001). AR and PDEF were more oftenco-expressed and the series of AR+ PDEF+ (126/246, 51.2%) had a poor survivalrate (P = 0.046). In Cox models, PDEF expression (P = 0.028) was an independentpredictor for OS. At the cellular protein and mRNA levels, our experiments alsoshowed a statistically significant positive correlation between PDEF and AR, and that PDEF may be regulated by AR.CONCLUSIONS: PDEF is associated with markers of bad prognosis, supporting itsrole as a growth promoter in ER- BC. Our findings also provide evidence that PDEFis strongly correlated with AR expression in ER- breast cancer; it may be adownstream target gene of AR and a potential prognostic factor in ER- BC.
