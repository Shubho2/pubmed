This study examines perioperative andoncologic outcomes of patients with malignant spinal tumors who underwentresection with intraoperative phosphorous-32 (P32) brachytherapy.METHODS: Consecutive adult patients who underwent P32 brachytherapy duringmalignant spinal tumor resection were retrospectively identified from 2014 to2015. Complications, tumor recurrence, and survival were reviewed. Acomprehensive review of the literature was performed.RESULTS: A total of 8 patients were included. Average age was 54.3 years, and25.0% were males. Tumor types included metastatic leiomyosarcoma, chordoma,multifocal recurrent ependymomas, breast metastasis, malignant meningioma, andmyxofibrosarcoma. One-half of patients underwent en bloc tumor resection. P32plaques were applied to 2 sites per patient for mean 13.1 minutes per site with agoal penetration of 10 Gy to 1-mm depth. Perioperative complications occurred in 3 patients (37.5%), including a persistent cerebral spinal fluid leak, deepinfection requiring reoperation, and sacral insufficiency fracture. At a mean25.6 months follow-up, local recurrence rate was 25.0%, and overall survival was 75.0%. Mean time to recurrence was 14.4 months. Survival at 6, 12, 18, and 24months was 100.0%, 100.0%, 85.7%, and 71.4%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The use of P32 is safe and feasible. P32 intraoperativebrachytherapy does not seem to increase the rate of complications. The samplesize of this series is small with heterogeneity in tumor type, but recurrence andsurvival outcomes seem promising compared with previous reports. Further clinicaltrials are needed.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.wneu.2018.04.105 PMID: 29702311  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
