[Epubahead of print]Estrogen biosynthesis in breast adipose tissue during menstrual cycle in womenwith and without breast cancer.Savolainen-Peltonen H(1)(2), Vihma V(2)(3), Wang F(2), Turpeinen U(4), HämäläinenE(4), Haanpää M(4), Leidenius M(5), Tikkanen MJ(2)(3), Mikkola TS(1)(2).Author information: (1)a Obstetrics and Gynecology , University of Helsinki and Helsinki UniversityHospital , Helsinki , Finland.(2)b Folkhälsan Research Center, Biomedicum , Helsinki , Finland.(3)c Heart and Lung Center , University of Helsinki and Helsinki UniversityHospital , Helsinki , Finland.(4)d HUSLAB , Helsinki University Hospital , Helsinki , Finland.(5)e Breast Surgery Unit , Helsinki University Hospital , Helsinki , Finland.Circulating estrogens fluctuate during the menstrual cycle but it is not knownwhether this fluctuation is related to local hormone levels in adipose tissue. Weanalyzed estrogen concentrations and gene expression of estrogen-regulatingenzymes in breast subcutaneous adipose tissue in premenopausal women with(n = 11) and without (n = 17) estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Estrone(E1) was the predominant estrogen in premenopausal breast adipose tissue, and E1 and mRNA expression of CYP19A1 in adipose tissue correlated positively with BMI. Adipose tissue estradiol (E2) concentrations fluctuated during the menstrualcycle, similarly to the serum concentrations. In women with breast cancer median adipose tissue E1 (1519 vs. 3244, p < .05) and E2 (404 vs. 889 pmol/kg, p < .05) levels were lower in the follicular than in the luteal phase whereas in controlwomen no significant differences were observed. In the follicular phase, mRNAexpressions of HSD17B1 (median 0.06; interquartile range 0.05-0.07 vs. 0.17;0.03-0.2, p = .010) and CYP19A1 (0.08; 0.07-0.14 vs. 0.22; 0.09-0.54, p = .025)were lower in women with breast cancer than in controls. In conclusion, thechanges in adipose tissue E1 and E2 concentrations and the estrogen-regulatingCYP19A1 and HSD17B1 during the menstrual cycle may be related to dysfunctionallocal estrogen metabolism in women with breast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/09513590.2018.1474868 PMID: 29790386
