While superficial barrier-forming skin products such asdressings are the standard of care in wound care management, their utilization aspreventive treatment approach in radiotherapy has barely attracted attention.METHODS: In this prospective, intra-patient randomized study, Hydrofilmpolyurethane film dressings were applied prophylactically to either the medial orlateral breast half of 62 patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvantradiation therapy following breast conserving surgery. The breast halfcontralateral to the film dressing was concurrently treated with 5% urea lotionas control skin care. Maximum severity of radiation dermatitis was assessed usingRTOG/EORTC toxicity scores, photospectrometric erythema measurements andpatient-assessed modified RISRAS scale.RESULTS: In the Hydrofilm compartments, mean maximum RTOG/EORTC radiationdermatitis severity grades were significantly reduced from 1.33 to 0.35 andphotospectrometric measurements showed significantly reduced erythema severity,as compared to the control compartments, with an overall response rate of 89.3%. Hydrofilm completely prevented moist desquamation and significantly reducedpatients' subjective experience of itching and pain.CONCLUSION: The obtained results along with a favorable cost-benefit ratio and aneasy and quick application suggest a prophylactic application of Hydrofilm inadjuvant radiotherapy of breast cancer patients to reduce or even preventradiation dermatitis.DOI: 10.1080/0284186X.2018.1441542 PMID: 29463159
