MDSCs consist of two majorsubsets, namely monocytic (M-) MDSCs and granulocytic (G-) MDSCs that differ withrespect to their phenotype, morphology and mechanisms of suppression. Here, wecultured bone marrow cells with IL-6 and GM-CSF in vitro to generate a populationof bone marrow MDSCs (BM-MDSCs) similar to G-MDSCs from tumor-bearing mice inregards to phenotype, morphology and suppressive-function. Through fluorescentlabeling of these BM-MDSCs and optical imaging, we could visualize therecruitment and localization of BM-MDSCs in breast tumor-bearing mice in vivo.Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that BM-MDSCs home to primary andmetastatic breast tumors, but have no significant effect on tumor growth orprogression. Ex vivo flow cytometry characterization of BM-MDSCs after adoptivetransfer demonstrated both organ-and tumor-specific effects on their phenotypeand differentiation, demonstrating the importance of the local microenvironmenton MDSC fate and function. In this study, we have developed a method to generate,visualize and detect BM-MDSCs in vivo and ex vivo through optical imaging andflow cytometry, in order to understand the organ-specific changes rendered toMDSCs in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196040 PMCID: PMC5909918PMID: 29677215  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
