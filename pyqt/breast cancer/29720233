We examined real-world evidence in the first year post approval tounderstand the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients treated with palbociclib in community oncology practices and the dosing, treatment, andcomplete blood count (CBC) monitoring patterns.METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of structured data from aUS electronic medical record (EMR) database. Female patients receivingpalbociclib after 31 January 2015 were followed through 31 March 2016. Ourmethodological rules were constructed to aggregate drugs received according tothe order in which they are given, i.e., identify the line of therapy as first,second, or third line, etc., using treatment order and course description fields from the EMR.RESULTS: There were 763 patients initiating palbociclib who met the selectioncriteria. Of those, 612 (80.2%) received palbociclib concomitantly withletrozole. Mean follow up was 6.4 months and mean age at palbociclib initiationwas 64 years. Of patients with a known starting dose (n = 417), 79.9% started on palbociclib 125 mg. Dose reductions were observed in 20.1% of patients.Percentages of patients according to line of therapy at initiation of palbociclibwere first-line, 39.5%; second-line, 15.7%; third-line, 13.1%; and fourth-linetherapy or later, 31.7%. On average, two CBC tests were conducted during thefirst cycle of palbociclib treatment. Overall, 74.6% of patients had aneutropenic event during follow up including 47.3% and 8.0% of patients with agrade 3 or 4 occurrence, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Real-world palbociclib use one year post US approval demonstrates a more heterogeneous patient population than that studied in the clinical trialswith more than half of the patients receiving palbociclib plus letrozole in laterlines of therapy. CBC testing rates suggested good provider compliance withmonitoring guidelines in the USA prescribing information. The occurrence of grade3 and 4 neutropenia (based on laboratory results) was consistent with the ratesof grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in two phase-III studies (PALOMA-2, 56% and 10%;PALOMA-3, 55% and 11%, respectively). Understanding palbociclib utilization inreal-world patients and how drug dosing and monitoring are performed aids in the understanding of safe and effective use of the drug.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0958-2 PMCID: PMC5932819PMID: 29720233
