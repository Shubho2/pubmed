With increasing scrutiny on outcomes and patientsatisfaction, there is an impetus for providers to be more deliberate inappropriate patient selection for breast reconstruction. The BreastReconstruction Risk Assessment (BRA) Score was developed for prediction ofcomplications after primary prosthetic breast reconstruction, focusing oncalculating risk estimations for a variety of complications based on individualpatient demographic and perioperative characteristics. In this study, weevaluated mastectomy skin flap necrosis (MSFN) as a function of patientcharacteristics to validate the BRA Score.STUDY DESIGN: We examined our prospective intra-institutional database ofprosthetic breast reconstructions from 2004 to 2015. The end point of interestwas 1-year occurrence of MSFN after stage I tissue expander placement.RESULTS: Nine hundred and three patients were included; 50% underwent bilateralreconstruction. Median follow-up was 23 months. Mean 1-year complication rateswere as follows: MSFN 12.4%, seroma 3.0%, infection 6.9%, dehiscence/exposure7.1%, and explantation 13.2%. Statistically significantly higher rates of MSFNwere found in older patients, smokers, patients with postoperative infections,patients with hypertension, and patients who used aspirin. Neoadjuvant oradjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, diabetes, and seroma formation did not have a statistically significant impact on necrosis rates.CONCLUSIONS: The BRA Score was expanded to estimate complication risk aftertissue expander placement up to 1 year postoperatively. The risk of MSFN ascalculated by the BRA Score: Extended Length is consistent with published studiesdemonstrating increased risk with specific comorbidities, and further validatesexpansion of the BRA score risk calculator.Copyright Â© 2018 American College of Surgeons.
