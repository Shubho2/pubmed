Theseparacrine effects are under the control of several genes and microRNAs. Wepresent here clear evidence that let-7b, a tumor suppressor microRNA, plays keyroles in the persistent activation of breast stromal fibroblasts and theirfunctional interplay with cancer cells. We have first shown that let-7b isdown-regulated in CAFs as compared to their corresponding normal adjacentfibroblasts, and transient specific let-7b inhibition permanently activatedbreast fibroblasts through induction of the IL-6-related positive feedback loop. More importantly, let-7b-deficient cells promoted the epithelial-to-mesenchymaltransition process in breast cancer cells in an IL-8-dependent manner, and alsoenhanced orthotopic tumor growth in vivo. On the other hand, overexpression oflet-7b by mimic permanently suppressed breast myofibroblasts through blocking thepositive feedback loop, which inhibited their paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects.Furthermore, we have shown that let-7b negatively controls IL-8, which showedhigher expression in the majority of CAF cells as compared to their adjacentnormal counterparts, indicating that IL-8 plays a major role in thecarcinoma/stroma cross-talk. These findings support targeting active stromalfibroblasts through restoration of let-7b/IL-8 expression as a therapeutic optionfor breast carcinomas.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24895 PMCID: PMC5915157PMID: 29707149
