The oestrogenreceptor (ER)-expressing breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D alongside their in vitro derived resistant counterparts MCF-7-TR (tamoxifen-resistant) andT47D-FR (fulvestrant-resistant) showed dual resistance to fulvestrant andtamoxifen in the presence of upregulated HER1 and HER2 growth factor receptors.Our study demonstrated that tamoxifen resistance and fulvestrant resistance areassociated with collateral sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)lapatinib (p < 0.0001) and afatinib (p < 0.0001). Further, we found that overtime, the TKIs reactivated ER&alpha; protein and/or mRNA in tamoxifen- andfulvestrant-resistant cells. Combinations of anti-endocrine agents with afatinib gave rise to significantly enhanced levels of apoptosis in both T47D-FR andMCF-7-TR in a synergistic manner versus additive effects of agents used singly.This was associated with p27kip1 induction for anti-endocrine-resistant cellsversus parental cells. Our data supports the use of combination treatmentutilising dual HER1/2 inhibitors in breast cancer patients showing resistance to multiple anti-endocrine agents.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10060209 PMCID: PMC6025235PMID: 29925812
