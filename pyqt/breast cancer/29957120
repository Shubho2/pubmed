PEGylated RSV-phospholipid complex bilayer enveloping casein-loadedmicelles (PEGPC-CAS MCs) were also developed as passive-targeted nanosystem.RESULTS: FA- and PEGPC-CAS MCs demonstrated a proper size with monomodaldistribution, sustained drug release profiles and good hemocompatibility. Thecoloaded MCs showed superior cytotoxicity to MCF-7 breast cancer cells comparedwith free drugs. Both nanosystems exerted excellent in vivo antitumor efficacy inbreast cancer bearing mice with PEGylated MCs showing comparable tumor regressionto folate-conjugated MCs.CONCLUSION: Evergreen nanoplatforms coloaded with monascus yellow pigments andRSV were effective for breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.2217/nnm-2018-0006 PMID: 29957120
