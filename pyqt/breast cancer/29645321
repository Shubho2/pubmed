Participants mostoften reported that discussions about family communication of BRCA test resultsto children and adult relatives were led only by their providers (38.2%-39.2%),as opposed to being led by the patient, both parties, or neither party. Providerswere most likely to lead these discussions when mothers had stronger familyhistories of cancer and expressed more confidence about making a decision to talkto their children about BRCA. However, mothers typically led such discussions if they were raising older children and held more positive attitudes about pediatricBRCA testing.CONCLUSIONS: When the assessment of BRCA genetic counseling outcomes includesfamily communication to potentially at-risk relatives, we learned that most butnot all sessions addressed this topic. Cancer family history, child age, andmaternal attitudes are important co-factors in these patient-providercommunication exchanges. Providers delivering BRCA genetic counseling should beattentive to mothers' information and support needs regarding communicatingcancer genetic test results to at-risk relatives, including children.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4733 PMID: 29645321
