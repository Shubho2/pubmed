In this work, a kind of glutathione (GSH)-responsivepolymer prodrug of SO2 was designed and synthesized, which presented synergistic effect with doxorubicin (DOX) for combating MCF-7 ADR human breast cancer cell.Firstly, a small molecular prodrug of SO2,N-(3-azidopropyl)-2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonamide (AP-DNs), was chemicallyconjugated onto the side chain of methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly(γ-propargyl-l-glutamate) (mPEG-PPLG) block copolymer to generate an amphiphilic polymer prodrug of SO2, mPEG-PLG (DNs). The obtained mPEG-PLG (DNs) prodrug couldself-assemble into micelles in aqueous media and release SO2 rapidly in response to thiol compounds. Then, DOX was loaded into mPEG-PLG (DNs) nanoparticles withultrahigh drug-loading efficiency (97.3%). In vitro drug release tests indicated that the DOX-loaded nanoparticles could simultaneously release SO2 and DOX by GSHtriggering. Moreover, the effective cellular uptake of the DOX-loadednanoparticles and subsequent intracellular release of SO2 and DOX were verifiedby confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry (FCM) analyses.The released SO2 could promote the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in tumorcells, which thereby resulted in oxidative damages of cancer cells, together withrestoration of MCF-7 ADR cells sensitivity to DOX. As a result, the released DOX and SO2 showed synergistic therapeutic effect against MCF-7 ADR cells. In vivoantitumor evaluation further indicated that, compared with free DOX, theDOX-loaded nanoparticles exhibited better antitumor effect in a MCF-7ADR-xenografted nude mice model while had lower system toxicity. Overall, wedemonstrated, for the first time, that a SO2 polymer prodrug, acting as astimuli-responsive nanocarrier to codeliver DOX, can efficiently inhibit theproliferation of MDR tumor cells, which may offer a new weapon for combating MDR in cancer therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
