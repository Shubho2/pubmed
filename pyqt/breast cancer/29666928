An ESR1 gene mutation, which encodes for the estrogen receptor (ER)protein, is one of the potential mechanisms of therapy resistance. The ESR1mutations result in conformational changes in the ER leading to subsequentestrogen-independent transcriptional activity. These mutations are found at alower level in early stage when compared to metastatic BC, more often throughselective pressure after aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment. Recent studies have explored the role of ESR1 mutations as potential prognostic and predictivebiomarkers and showed that ESR1 mutations are likely associated with a moreaggressive disease. However, definitive associations with outcome in order tomake a specific treatment recommendation are yet to be found. The development of targeted therapy directed to ESR1-mutated clones is an appealing concept, andpreclinical and clinical works are in progress. ESR1 mutations represent anexciting field with a rapidly increasing number of recent publications that will likely advance the knowledge of treatment resistance mechanisms and pave the way into more individualized patient endocrine treatment.DOI: 10.1007/s11864-018-0542-0 PMID: 29666928
