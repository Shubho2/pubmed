This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association of 2D : 4D with cancerdiagnosis, malignancy, and age at presentation.Methods: Studies that evaluated the association of 2D : 4D with cancer risk were collected from Pubmed/MEDLINE and Clarivate Analytics databases. Nineteen studieswere included in the qualitative analysis.Results: The 2D : 4D ratio was studied in prostate cancer, breast cancer,testicular cancer, gastric cancer, oral cancer, brain tumors, and cervicalintraepithelial neoplasia. Low 2D : 4D was associated with prostate cancer,gastric cancer, and brain tumors, while high 2D : 4D, with breast cancer risk andcervical dysplasia. The 2D : 4D ratio was not associated with prostate, breast,and gastric cancer stage. Greater 2D : 4D ratio was associated with youngerpresentation of breast cancer and brain tumors. The meta-analyses demonstratedthat testicular cancer was not associated with right-hand 2D : 4D ratio (p =0.74) and gastric cancer was not associated with right-hand (p = 0.15) andleft-hand (p = 0.95) 2D : 4D ratio.Conclusions: Sex hormone environment during early development is associated with cancer risk later in life. Further studies exploring the link betweenintrauterine hormone environment and cancer risk are encouraged.DOI: 10.1155/2018/7698193 PMCID: PMC5822871PMID: 29581795
