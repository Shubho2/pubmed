Steele Laboratories, Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, MGH and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA,02114, USA.Breast cancer metastasizes through the lymphovascular system to the regionallymph nodes in the axilla and to both visceral and non-visceral sites. Renewedinterest in the route by which tumor cells gain access to blood and lymphaticcapillaries are the subject of research at mechanical, anatomic, pathologic,genetic, epidemiologic and molecular levels. Two papers presented at the 7thInternational Symposium on Cancer Metastasis in San Francisco showed tumor cells entering the systemic circulation through the sentinel lymph node. Thisinformation challenges the current paradigm where clinicians believe that access is gained through intra- and peri-tumoral blood vessels and that metastasis toaxillary lymph nodes is an interesting epi-phenomenon. The sentinel lymph nodeera has changed the modern surgical approach to the axilla and the basis of this change is summarized in this paper. A new approach to the management of axillary metastases after systemic therapy relies on determining whether there is acomplete pathologic response; if no tumor is found in the previously biopsiednode, a complete axillary lymph node dissection may be avoided. African American women seem to inherit a trait from West African ancestors and tend to developmore lethal types of breast cancer. These tumors may have a molecular machinerythat enhances their ability to metastasize to visceral sites and future research may unearth the mechanisms for this phenomenon.DOI: 10.1007/s10585-018-9902-1 PMID: 29796854
