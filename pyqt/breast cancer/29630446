Epub 2018 Apr 9.47-mG2a: A Mouse IgG2a-Type of PcMab-47 Useful for Detecting Podocalyxin inEsophageal Cancers by Immunohistochemistry.Kaneko MK(1), Itai S(1), Yamada S(1), Kato Y(1).Author information: (1)Department of Antibody Drug Development, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine , Sendai, Japan .Esophageal cancer is one of the highly malignant cancers. It comprises two of themost common histological tumor types: squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) andadenocarcinoma. SCC accounts for about 90% of esophageal cancers. Despitedevelopments in treatment strategies, the prognosis and survival rate remainpoor. Podocalyxin (PODXL) is a highly glycosylated type-I transmembrane protein. It is expressed in normal tissues such as kidney, heart, breast, and pancreas.Upregulation of PODXL correlates with tumor progression, invasion, andmetastasis. Therefore, this glycoprotein could be a potential biomarker forpredicting the prognosis of some cancers, for instance, brain, colorectal, oral, lung, bladder, prostate, and ovarian cancers. We previously developed a specific and sensitive anti-PODXL monoclonal antibody (mAb), PcMab-47 (mouse IgG1, kappa) and its mouse IgG2a-type (47-mG2a). We showed their utility inimmunohistochemical analysis of oral cancers. Herein, we demonstrate thatPcMab-47 and 47-mG2a can also be used to detect esophageal squamous cellcarcinoma (ESCC) with this technique. These two antibodies, respectively, stained123/130 (94.6%) and 127/130 (97.7%) ESCC cases, indicating that they can detectPODXL with high sensitivity in this carcinoma. Of more than 3+ cases, 47-mG2a wasmore effective than PcMab-47, respectively, staining 56/127 (44.1%) and 41/123(33.3%). Therefore, 47-mG2a can be used for the detection of PODXL in ESCC using immunohistochemical analysis.DOI: 10.1089/mab.2018.0003 PMID: 29630446
