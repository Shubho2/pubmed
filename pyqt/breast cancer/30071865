ENMD-2076 is a small-moleculeinhibitor of Aurora and angiogenic kinases with proapoptotic andantiproliferative activity in preclinical models of TNBC.METHODS: This dual-institution, single-arm, two-stage, phase II clinical trialenrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC previously treatedwith one to three prior lines of chemotherapy in the advanced setting. Patientswere treated with ENMD-2076 250 mg orally once daily with continuous dosing in4-week cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Theprimary endpoint was 6-month clinical benefit rate (CBR), and secondary endpointsincluded progression-free survival, pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and biologiccorrelates in archival and fresh serial tumor biopsies in a subset of patients.RESULTS: Forty-one patients were enrolled. The 6-month CBR was 16.7% (95% CI,6-32.8%) and included two partial responses. The 4-month CBR was 27.8% (95% CI,14-45.2%), and the average duration of benefit was 6.5 cycles. Common adverseevents included hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea. Treatment withENMD-2076 resulted in a decrease in cellular proliferation and microvesseldensity and an increase in p53 and p73 expression, consistent with preclinicalobservations.CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent ENMD-2076 treatment resulted in partial response orclinical benefit lasting more than 6 months in 16.7% of patients with pretreated,advanced, or metastatic TNBC. These results support the development of predictivebiomarkers using archival and fresh tumor tissue, as well as consideration ofmechanism-based combination strategies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01639248 .
