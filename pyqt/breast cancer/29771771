We regardedrecurrence within 6 months after surgery as early recurrence.RESULTS: This study involved 115 patients (80 who underwent upfront surgery and35 who received NAT). Serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 greater than 85 U/mL andp53 expression in 0 or more than 80% of tumor cells were independent risk factorsfor early recurrence after upfront surgery. We classified patients into ahigh-risk group (1 or 2 risk factors) and a low-risk group (no risk factors). In the high-risk group, the median overall survival time of patients with NAT wassignificantly longer than that of patients without NAT (P = 0.028). By contrast, the median overall survival time was not different according to NAT in thelow-risk group.CONCLUSIONS: Serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and p53 expression of the primarytumor could be predictors of early recurrence in patients with resectablepancreatic cancer. The prognosis of patients with a high risk of early recurrencemay be improved using NAT.DOI: 10.1097/MPA.0000000000001066 PMID: 29771771
