China.(3)Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221002, P.R.China.Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase activated byvarious types of collagens that performs a critical role in cell attachment,migration, survival and proliferation. The functions of DDR1 in various types of tumor have been studied extensively. However, in breast carcinoma, the roles ofcollagen-evoked DDR1 remain ill defined. Although a number of studies havereported that DDR1 promotes apoptosis and inhibits migration in breast carcinoma,it has also been reported to be associated with tumor cell survival,chemoresistance to genotoxic drugs and the facilitation of invasion. The present review summarizes current progress and the complex effects of DDR1 in the fieldof breast carcinoma, and presents DDR1 as a promising therapeutic target.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7795 PMCID: PMC5795932PMID: 29467865
