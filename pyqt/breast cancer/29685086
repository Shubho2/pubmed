We describe the alternative technique ofradioactive seed localization (RSL) in 3 patients with residual or recurrentpapillary thyroid cancer. This technique has been used for many years in thesetting of nonpalpable breast cancer, where it has been shown to be safe and has been associated with greater surgeon satisfaction as well as improved patienttolerability, cosmesis, and outcomes compared to needle localization. Inaddition, RSL allows complete decoupling of the radiology and surgery schedules. RSL was successful in our 3 patients with regard to safety, patient tolerability,and scheduling.DOI: 10.1177/0194599818772049 PMID: 29685086
