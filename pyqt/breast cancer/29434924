Theexpression levels of KIF4A have been investigated in numerous types of cancer,including cervical, lung, oral, and breast cancer, and are established to beassociated with poor patient prognosis. However, the role of KIF4A, as well asits expression in colorectal cancer (CRC), remains to be elucidated. Therefore,the current study investigated KIF4A expression levels in patients with CRC anddemonstrated that its levels were increased in tumor tissues compared withnon-tumor tissues. To investigate the functional role of KIF4A, KIF4A was knockeddown in CRC cells and cell viability was evaluated. CRC cells with KIF4Aknockdown exhibited lower cell proliferation compared with control cells. Inaddition, KIF4A expression levels, as determined by immunohistochemistry, werecompared with the expression of Ki-67, but no significant associations wereobserved in the patients with CRC. Therefore, KIF4A was found to be upregulatedin patients with CRC and downregulation of KIF4A reduced cell proliferation inCRC cells. These results suggest that KIF4A may be a potential therapeutictarget, which may improve the outcomes of patients with CRC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7555 PMCID: PMC5776904PMID: 29434924
