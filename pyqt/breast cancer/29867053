However, underconditions of disease, the balance between bone resorption and deposition isupset. Osteoblasts play an important role in bone homeostasis by depositing newbone osteoid into resorption pits. It is becoming increasingly evident thatosteoblasts additionally play key roles in cancer cell dissemination to bone and subsequent metastasis. Our laboratory has evidence that when osteoblasts comeinto contact with disseminated breast cancer cells, the osteoblasts producefactors that initially reduce breast cancer cell proliferation, yet promotecancer cell survival in bone. Other laboratories have demonstrated thatosteoblasts both directly and indirectly contribute to dormant cancer cellreactivation in bone. Moreover, we have demonstrated that osteoblasts undergo an inflammatory stress response in late stages of breast cancer, and produceinflammatory cytokines that are maintenance and survival factors for breastcancer cells and osteoclasts. Advances in understanding interactions betweenosteoblasts, osteoclasts, and bone metastatic cancer cells will aid incontrolling and ultimately preventing cancer cell metastasis to bone.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10060182 PMCID: PMC6025347PMID: 29867053
