In this retrospective study, based on the14-year follow-up of 73 patients with breast cancer after surgery andradiotherapy but no subsequent systemic therapy, we investigated the prognostictime dependence of intra-tumoural IFNγ mRNA and protein levels. Over the entire14 years of follow-up, neither IFNγ mRNA nor protein was significantly associatedwith metastasis outcome by AUC and Cox regression criteria. However, evaluationof the shorter periods has revealed a prognostic significance in the latefollow-up period of 7-14 years for IFNγ mRNA and protein with the maximalrespective AUCs of 0.72 and 0.73 and hazard ratios of 6.1 and 5.2, respectively. Interestingly, the opposite prognostic association was discovered for IFNγ mRNAand protein in the first 7 years of follow-up, possibly due to the negativecorrelation of IFNγ protein and mRNA. Moreover, the prognostic association ofIFNγ mRNA has shifted from marking the favourable outcome in the first 7 years topoor outcome thereafter. This study contributes to clarification of thepreviously inconsistent prognostic performance of IFNγ by providing the firstprognostic evaluation with long follow-up, time-dependence assessment and absenceof any chemotherapy influence.DOI: 10.1684/ecn.2018.0402 PMID: 29478965
