Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a promising predictor forbreast cancer prognoses but their reliability regarding progression-free survival(PFS) is controversial. We aim to verify their predictive value in TNBC.Methods: In present prospective cohort study, we used the Pep@MNPs method toenumerate CTCs in baseline blood samples from 75 patients with TNBC (taken atinclusion in this study) and analyzed correlations between CTC numbers andoutcomes and other clinical parameters.Results: Median PFS was 6.0 (range: 1.0-25.0) months for the entire cohort, inwhom we found no correlations between baseline CTC status and initial tumor stage(P=0.167), tumor grade (P=0.783) or histological type (P=0.084). However, amongthose getting first-line treatment, baseline CTC status was positively correlatedwith ratio of peripheral natural killer (NK) cells (P=0.032), presence of lungmetastasis (P=0.034) and number of visceral metastatic site (P=0.037). BaselineCTC status was predictive for PFS in first-line TNBC (P=0.033), but not for thecohort as a whole (P=0.118). This prognostic limitation of CTC could beameliorated by combining CTC and NK cell enumeration (P=0.049).Conclusions: Baseline CTC status was predictive of lung metastasis, peripheral NKcell ratio and PFS in TNBC patients undergoing first-line treatment. We havedeveloped a combined CTC-NK enumeration strategy that allows us to predict PFS inTNBC without any preconditions.DOI: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.03.04 PMCID: PMC6037585PMID: 30046226
