We also evaluated repair of DNA damage after the end of RT, as wellas the response of patient's cells before treatment with an oxidizing agent(H2O2; challenge assay). Fifty women with a mammographic diagnosis negative forcancer (control group) and 100 women with a diagnosis of breast cancer (followed up during the treatment) were involved in this study. The significant DNA damage was observed by increasing in the index and frequency of damage along with theincreasing of the frequency of micronuclei in peripheral blood and cells of thebuccal mucosa, respectively. Despite the variability of the responses of breastcancer patients, the individuals presented lesions on the DNA, detected by theComet assay and micronucleus Test, from the diagnosis until the end of theoncological treatment and were more susceptible to oxidative stress. We canconclude that the damages were due to clastogenic and/or aneugenic effectsrelated to the neoplasia itself and that they increased, especially after RT.DOI: 10.1155/2018/2846819 PMCID: PMC6022262PMID: 30013718
