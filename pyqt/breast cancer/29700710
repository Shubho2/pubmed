However, some patients exhibitprimary resistance to T-DM1, and thus methods that can predict resistance inclinical practice are needed. Genomic analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)in plasma is a non-invasive and reproducible method. This study aimed to predict primary resistance to T-DM1 by combining genomic analysis of ctDNA and otherclinicopathological features of patients with HER2-positive ABC.METHODS: The study population comprised 34 patients with HER2-positive ABC whohad been treated with T-DM1. Correlations between clinicopathologicalcharacteristics of patients and primary resistance to T-DM1 were examined, andHER2 gene copy number and PIK3CA gene mutations were analyzed using plasma ctDNA samples obtained from 16 patients before T-DM1 administration.RESULTS: Among the 34 patients, nine (26.5%) had progressive disease at the firstefficacy analysis; these patients were considered to have primary resistance toT-DM1. No significant difference was found in the rate of primary resistance toT-DM1 between groups. Among 16 patients whose ctDNA was analyzed, four showedprimary resistance to T-DM1. These four patients showed negative HER2 geneamplification in ctDNA and were ER-positive and/or PR-positive byimmunohistochemistry.CONCLUSIONS: HER2 gene amplification in ctDNA and ER and PR status may predictprimary resistance to T-DM1. A liquid biopsy before the initiation of T-DM1treatment could be a non-invasive way to predict whether a patient would exhibit primary resistance to T-DM1.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0861-9 PMID: 29700710
