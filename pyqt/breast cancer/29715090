Radiobiological research isneeded to understand molecular differences that affect radiosensitivity ofdifferent tumor subtypes and the response variability. The aim of this study was to analyze gene expression profiling (GEP) in primary BC cells followingirradiation with doses of 9 Gy and 23 Gy delivered by intraoperative electronradiation therapy (IOERT) in order to define gene signatures of response to high doses of ionizing radiation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed GEP by cDNA microarrays and evaluated cellsurvival after IOERT treatment in primary BC cell cultures. Real-timequantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) wasperformed to validate candidate genes.RESULTS: We showed, for the first time, a 4-gene and a 6-gene signature, as newmolecular biomarkers, in two primary BC cell cultures after exposure at 9 Gy and 23 Gy respectively, for which we observed a significantly high survival rate.CONCLUSION: Gene signatures activated by different doses of ionizing radiationmay predict response to RT and contribute to defining a personalizedbiological-driven treatment plan.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12512 PMID: 29715090  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
