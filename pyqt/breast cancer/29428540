While some dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitors crossthe blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cause central as well as peripheral effects(nepicastat), others have limited access to the brain (etamicastat, zamicastat). In this context, peripheral selectivity is clinically advantageous, in order toprevent alterations of noradrenaline levels in the CNS and the occurrence ofadverse central effects. A limited brain exposure results from the combination ofseveral factors, such as a reduced passive permeability or affinity for effluxtransporters, but efflux liabilities may also lead to unwanted drug-druginteractions (DDIs) in the presence of co-administered substrates or inhibitors. Thus, the purpose of the study herein presented was to explore the interaction ofP-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), the two major efflux transporters of the BBB that hamper the entry of several drugs to thebrain, with the DBH inhibitors, etamicastat, nepicastat and zamicastat.Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK II) and transfected lines with human MDR1(MDCK-MDR1) and ABCG2 (MDCK-BCRP) genes were used as a BBB surrogate model. P-gp and BCRP substrates and/or inhibitors were identified through intracellularaccumulation and bidirectional permeability assays. The obtained data revealedthat zamicastat is a concentration-dependent dual P-gp and BCRP inhibitor withIC50 values of 73.8 ± 7.2 μM and 17.0 ± 2.7 μM, while etamicastat and nepicastat inhibited BCRP to greater extent than P-gp, with IC50 values of 47.7 ± 1.8 μM and59.2 ± 9.4 μM, respectively. Additionally, etamicastat was identified as P-gp andBCRP dual substrate, as demonstrated by net flux ratios of 5.84 and 3.87 anddecreased >50% by verapamil and Ko143. Conversely, nepicastat revealed to be aP-gp-only substrate, with a net flux ratio of 2.01, reduced to 0.92 in thepresence of verapamil. Furthermore, nepicastat displayed a consistently higherapparent permeability (>8.49 × 10-6 cm s-1) than etamicastat(<0.58 × 10-6 cm s-1). The identification of etamicastat as a dual effluxsubstrate suggests that P-gp and BCRP may be partially responsible for thelimited central exposure of this compound, in association with its low passivepermeability. Moreover, the weak efflux inhibitory potencies of etamicastat andnepicastat revealed a low DDI risk, while the dual P-gp/BCRP inhibition ofzamicastat could be studied in the future with synergically effluxed compounds,for which BBB penetration is severely impaired.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
