Epub 2017 Jun 9.3d Tissue Engineered In Vitro Models Of Cancer In Bone.Sitarski AM(1)(2), Fairfield H(1)(2)(3), Falank C(1)(2)(3), Reagan MR(1)(2)(3).Author information: (1)Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Scarborough, Maine 04074, USA.(2)University of Maine, Orono, Maine 04469, USA.(3)School of Medicine, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.Biological models are necessary tools for gaining insight into underlyingmechanisms governing complex pathologies such as cancer in the bone. Models rangefrom in vitro tissue culture systems to in vivo models and can be used withcorresponding epidemiological and clinical data to understand disease etiology,progression, driver mutations, and signaling pathways. In bone cancer, as withmany other cancers, in vivo models are often too complex to study specificcell-cell interactions or protein roles, and 2D models are often too simple toaccurately represent disease processes. Consequently, researchers haveincreasingly turned to 3D in vitro tissue engineered models as a usefulcompromise. In this review, tissue engineered 3D models of bone and cancer aredescribed in depth and compared to 2D models. Biomaterials and cell types usedare described, and future directions in the field of tissue engineered bonecancer models are proposed.DOI: 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00097 PMCID: PMC5945209 [Available on 2019-02-12]PMID: 29756030
