Cox regression was used. Noncollinearpredictors with < 10% missing data, with ≥ 10 events per stratum, and withP < .05 in a univariate analysis were tested through a backward stepwiseselection. For the original and revised Tokuhashi prognostic scoring systems(PSSs), Tomita PSS, modified Bauer PSS, van der Linden PSS, Bartels model,Oswestry Spinal Risk Index, and Bollen PSS, this study examined calibrationgraphically, discrimination with Harrell c-statistics, and survival stratified byrisk groups with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.RESULTS: The following were significant in the univariate analysis: type ofprimary tumor, sex, organ metastasis, body mass index, preoperative radiotherapy to MESCC, physical component (PC) of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey,version 2 (SF-36v2), and EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) Questionnaire. Breast,prostate and thyroid primary tumor (HR: 2.9; P =.0005), presence of organmetastasis (hazard ratio (HR): 2.0; P = .005) and SF-36v2 PC (HR: 0.95; P <.0001) were associated with survival in multivariable analysis. Predictedprognoses poorly matched observed values on calibration plots; Bartels modelcalibration slope was 0.45. Bollen PSS (0.61; 95% CI: 0.58-0.64) and Bartelsmodel (0.68; 95% CI: 0.65-0.71) had the lowest and highest c-statistics,respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The primary tumor type (breast, prostate, or thyroid), an absence oforgan metastasis, and a lower degree of physical disability are preoperativepredictors of longer survival for surgical MESCC patients. These results are inkeeping with current models. This full external validation of 8 prognostic PSSsor model of survival in surgical MESCC patients has revealed that calibration is poor, especially for long-term survivors, whereas discrimination is possiblyhelpful.
