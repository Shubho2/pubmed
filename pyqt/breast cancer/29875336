The role ofdifferent TRPM members has been shown in various cancers such as prostate cancer for mostly TRPM8 and TRPM2, breast cancer for mostly TRPM2 and TRPM7, andpancreatic cancer for TRPM2/7/8 channels. The role of TRPM5 channels has beenshown in lung cancer, TRPM1 in melanoma, and TRPM4 channel in prostate cancer as well. Thus, the TRPM family of channels may represent an appealing target for theanticancer therapy.DOI: 10.3390/ph11020058 PMCID: PMC6027338PMID: 29875336
