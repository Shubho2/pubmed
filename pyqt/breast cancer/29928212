Although several reports have suggested a poor prognosis for RAAS, the 5-year overall survival of RAAS is better than that of cutaneous angiosarcoma(CAS), suggesting that the prognostic factors of RAAS and CAS might be different,at least in part. In this report, we describe a case of RAAS, and employedimmunohistochemical (IHC) staining of PD-L1 and MMP9 as well as periostin, IL-4, and CD163. Interestingly, IHC staining revealed that the RAAS in our case waspositive for PD-L1 and negative for MMP9. Moreover, the predominant stromalfactor of our case was periostin, suggesting that TAMs in the present case wasnot immunosuppressive, but an inflammatory subtype. These results might explain, at least in part, the better prognosis of RAAS compared to CAS.DOI: 10.1159/000489628 PMCID: PMC6006628PMID: 29928212
