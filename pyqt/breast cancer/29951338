The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)is known to promote the invasive and migratory potential of breast cancer cellsthrough induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via theERK/NF-κB/Snail signaling pathway, leading to breast cancer metastasis. Targetingthis pathway to revert the EMT would be an attractive, novel therapeutic strategyto halt breast cancer metastasis.Methods: Effects of enterolactone (EL) on the cell cycle and apoptosis wereinvestigated using flow cytometry and a cleaved caspase-3 enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Effects of TGF-β induction and ELtreatment on the functional malignancy of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells wereinvestigated using migration and chemo-invasion assays. The effects of EL on EMT markers and the ERK/NF-κB/Snail signaling pathway after TGF-β induction werestudied using confocal microscopy, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot, and flow cytometry.Results: Herein, we report that EL exhibits a significant antimetastatic effecton MDA-MB-231 cells by almost reverting the TGF-β-induced EMT in vitro. ELdownregulates the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin, and upregulatesthe epithelial markers E-cadherin and occludin. It represses actin stress fiberformation via inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase p-38 (MAPK-p38) and cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44). EL also suppresses ERK-1/2, NF-κB, andSnail at the mRNA and protein levels.Conclusions: Briefly, EL was found to inhibit TGF-β-induced EMT by blocking theERK/NF-κB/Snail signaling pathway, which is a promising target for breast cancer metastasis therapy.DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2018.0012 PMCID: PMC5994556PMID: 29951338
