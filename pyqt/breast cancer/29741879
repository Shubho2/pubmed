Epub2018 Jun 11.Reanalysis of Global Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Data Identified a LargeNumber of Glycopeptides.Hu Y(1), Shah P(1), Clark DJ(1), Ao M(1), Zhang H(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology , Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , Maryland21287 , United States.Protein glycosylation plays fundamental roles in many cellular processes, andprevious reports have shown dysregulation to be associated with several humandiseases, including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Despitethe vital role of glycosylation for proper protein function, the analysis ofglycoproteins has been lagged behind to other protein modifications. In thisstudy, we describe the reanalysis of global proteomic data from breast cancerxenograft tissues using recently developed software package GPQuest 2.0,revealing a large number of previously unidentified N-linked glycopeptides. More importantly, we found that using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)technology for the enrichment of phosphopeptides had coenriched a substantialnumber of sialoglycopeptides, allowing for a large-scale analysis ofsialoglycopeptides in conjunction with the analysis of phosphopeptides.Collectively, combined tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses of globalproteomic and phosphoproteomic data sets resulted in the identification of 6 724 N-linked glycopeptides from 617 glycoproteins derived from two breast cancerxenograft tissues. Next, we utilized GPQuest 2.0 for the reanalysis of global andphosphoproteomic data generated from 108 human breast cancer tissues that werepreviously analyzed by Clinical Proteomic Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Reanalysisof the CPTAC data set resulted in the identification of 2 683 glycopeptides from the global proteomic data set and 4 554 glycopeptides from phosphoproteomic data set, respectively. Together, 11 292 N-linked glycopeptides corresponding to 1 731N-linked glycosites from 883 human glycoproteins were identified from the twodata sets. This analysis revealed an extensive number of glycopeptides hidden in the global and enriched in IMAC-based phosphopeptide-enriched proteomic data,information which would have remained unknown from the original study otherwise. The reanalysis described herein can be readily applied to identify glycopeptides from already existing data sets, providing insight into many important facets of protein glycosylation in different biological, physiological, and pathologicalprocesses.DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b01137 PMID: 29741879
