Several technologies have beentested for IORT and various randomised controlled trials are still ongoing.Different methods of application of IORT have also been evaluated, from earlybreast cancer to tumour bed boost radiotherapy amongst high risk women. TARGIT-A and ELIOT trials have reported a low incidence of local recurrence and goodsurvival in both arms. Moreover, mortality has been found to be lower amongstwomen who underwent partial breast radiotherapy compared to those treated withEBRT in a recent meta-analysis. Despite this, IORT has not been introduced in thecurrent clinical practice as yet, and many clinicians do not mention thistreatment option to patients awaiting breast cancer surgery. The scientificcommunity does not unanimously support the effectiveness of IORT and still raisesconcerns about introducing IORT as a standard treatment option for breast cancer.Current evidence demonstrates that IORT is ready for roll-out; it is time to let well-selected and informed patients be offered this treatment option in thecurrent clinical practice.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.793 PMCID: PMC5804714PMID: 29434659
