By far, Gene-centricor network-centric gene prioritization methods are predominated. Genes and their protein products carry out cellular processes in the context of functionalmodules. Dysfunctional gene modules have been previously reported to haveassociations with cancer. However, gene module information has seldom beenconsidered in cancer-related gene prioritization.RESULTS: In this study, we propose a novel method, MGOGP (Module and GeneOntology-based Gene Prioritization), for cancer-related gene prioritization.Different from other methods, MGOGP ranks genes considering information of bothindividual genes and their affiliated modules, and utilize Gene Ontology (GO)based fuzzy measure value as well as known cancer-related genes as heuristics.The performance of the proposed method is comprehensively validated by using bothbreast cancer and prostate cancer datasets, and by comparison with other methods.Results show that MGOGP outperforms other methods, and successfully prioritizesmore genes with literature confirmed evidence.CONCLUSIONS: This work will aid researchers in the understanding of the geneticarchitecture of complex diseases, and improve the accuracy of diagnosis and theeffectiveness of therapy.DOI: 10.1186/s12859-018-2216-0 PMCID: PMC5989416PMID: 29871590
