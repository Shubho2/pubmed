However, these functional polymorphisms inLinc-ROR and their associations with breast cancer (BC) susceptibility werescarcely reported. In this molecular epidemiological study, four SNPs (rs6420545,rs4801078, rs1942348 and rs9636089) were selected in Linc-ROR by bioinformaticsmethod. Unconditional logistic regression model was performed to analyze theassociations between four SNPs and BC susceptibility adjusted for reproductivefactors. Quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR was used to evaluate relativeexpression of Linc-ROR in plasma. The interactions of gene reproductive factorswere assessed by Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method. A novelfinding showed TT (OR: 1.79; 95%CI: 1.20-2.68) genotype of rs4801078 in Linc-ROR had a significant association with the higher risk of BC and the expression ofLinc-ROR mRNA was closely related with the alleles of rs4801078. In addition, we found the interaction of rs4801078, number of pregnancy and menopausal statusmight increase BC risk (OR: 2.78; 95%CI: 2.74-3.61). Our results suggest thatinteractions of SNPs in Linc-ROR and reproductive factors might contribute to BC risk, and alleles of rs4801078 might affect Linc-ROR expression level.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22881-x PMCID: PMC5856846PMID: 29549263
