Unlike RA, 4-HPR inducesapoptosis in tumor cells. Because 4-HPR can hydrolyze to liberate RA, a potenthuman teratogen, the unhydrolyzable ketone analog of 4-HPR,4-hydroxybenzylretinone (4-HBR) has been prepared and has been found to causeapoptosis in tumor cells and shrink carcinogen-induced rat mammary tumors as4-HPR does. Herein, we examined the mechanism whereby 4-HPR and 4-HBR induceapoptosis and death in breast cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiling was conducted in MCF-7 cellsover a 1.5- to 6-h time course and changes were validated by quantitativepolymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (GADD153 or C/EBP homologous protein, CHOP) was knocked down and the effecton 4-HPR-induced cell death and gene expression was assessed. 4-HPR synergy with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL or Apo2ligand) was also examined.RESULTS: Drug treatment induced increased expression of endoplasmic reticulum(ER) stress-related and pro-apoptotic genes. Gene expression changes wereverified by qPCR in three invasive ductal breast carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7,T-47D, MDA-MB-231). GADD153 showed the largest increase in the microarrayexperiment; however, knockdown of GADD153 did not abrogate apoptosis and death.Genes related to the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis including a receptor forTRAIL, death receptor 5 (DR5), were up-regulated by drug treatment. A dose of4-HPR that alone is ineffective in killing TRAIL-resistant MCF-7 cells,synergized with recombinant TRAIL to induce breast cancer cell death.CONCLUSION: 4-HPR and analogs might be useful in sensitizing tumor cells to deathreceptor agonists.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12742 PMID: 30061204  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
