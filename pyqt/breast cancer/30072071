Electronic address: eqlee@partners.org.Brain metastases from solid tumors are associated with increased morbidity andmortality. Standard treatment is local therapy with surgery and/or radiationtherapy although there is increasing interest in systemic therapies that cancontrol both intracranial and extracranial disease. We review the most recentdata for local therapy and systemic therapy options. Active areas of researchwithin radiation oncology include hippocampal sparing whole brain radiationtherapy and stereotactic approaches for patients with more than 4 brainmetastases. Newer targeted therapies with better central nervous systempenetration and immunotherapies have demonstrated promising results in clinicaltrials of patients with brain metastases.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
