AndersonCancer Center, Houston, TX. Electronic address: bcarter2@mdanderson.org.Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and accounts formore deaths than breast, prostate, and colon cancers combined. Traditionally,treatment options have included surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.Continual advances in the characterization of lung cancer have resulted in thedevelopment of effective immunotherapies. These agents help the immune systemrecognize tumors as foreign, stimulate the immune system, and relieve theinhibition that allows the growth and spread of cancer. Conventional responsecriteria such as the World Health Organization criteria and Response EvaluationCriteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) have been used extensively in clinical trials; however, these guidelines have been optimized for use with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Data from clinical trials employing immunotherapy has shown thatunique responses may be seen with these agents that are not fully captured byconventional response criteria. In response to these observations, severalmodified criteria have been developed for use with immunotherapy, includingimmune-related response criteria, immune-related RECIST, and immune RECIST. Asthe use of immunotherapy continues to grow, there is increasing recognition ofimmune-related adverse events, which may manifest on imaging examinations.Copyright Â© 2018.
