Electronic address: srohani@uwo.ca.Protein-based micelles have shown significant potential for tumor-targeteddelivery of anti-cancer drugs. In this light, self-assembled nanocarriers basedon GRAS (Generally recognized as safe) amphiphilic protein co-polymers weresynthesized via carbodiimide coupling reaction. The new nano-platform is composedof the following key components: (i) hydrophobic zein core to encapsulate thehydrophobic drugs rapamycin (RAP) and wogonin (WOG) with high encapsulationefficiency, (ii) hydrophilic lactoferrin (Lf) corona to enhance the tumortargeting, and prolong systemic circulation of the nanocarriers, and (iii)glutaraldehyde (GLA)-crosslinking to reduce the particle size and improvemicellar stability. Zein-Lf micelles showed relatively rapid release of WOGfollowed by slower diffusion of RAP from zein core. This sequential release mayaid in efflux pump inhibition by WOG thus sensitizing tumor cells to RAP action. Interestingly, these micelles showed good hemocompatibility as well as enhancedserum stability owing to the brush-like architecture of Lf shell. Moreover, this combined nano-delivery system maximized synergistic cytotoxicity of RAP and WOGin terms of tumor inhibition in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and Ehrlich ascitestumor animal model as a result of enhanced active targeting. Collectively,GLA-crosslinked zein-Lf micelles hold great promise for combined RAP/WOG deliveryto breast cancer with reduced drug dose, minimized side effects and maximizedanti-tumor efficacy.Copyright Â© 2018.
