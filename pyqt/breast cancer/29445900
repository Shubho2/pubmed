Theincreasing availability of multigene panel tests for clinical applications allowstesting of well-defined high-risk genes, as well as moderate-risk genes, forwhich the penetrance and spectrum of cancer risk are less well characterized.Moderate-risk genes are defined as genes that, when altered by a pathogenicvariant, confer a 2 to fivefold relative risk of cancer. Two such genes included on many comprehensive cancer panels are the DNA repair genes ATM and CHEK2, best known for moderately increased risk of breast cancer development. However, theimpact of screening and preventative interventions and spectrum of cancer riskbeyond breast cancer associated with ATM and/or CHEK2 variants remain less wellcharacterized. We convened a large, multidisciplinary, cross-sectional panel ofGCRA clinicians to review challenging, peer-submitted cases of patientsidentified with ATM or CHEK2 variants. This paper summarizes theinter-professional case discussion and recommendations generated during thesession, the level of concordance with respect to recommendations between theacademic and community clinician participants for each case, and potentialbarriers to implementing recommended care in various practice settings.DOI: 10.1007/s10689-018-0070-x PMID: 29445900
