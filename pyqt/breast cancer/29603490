However, socioeconomic disparities in psychosocial adjustment tobreast cancer have garnered little attention. This study addresses the researchgap by investigating the associations between socioeconomic indicators (ie,education, annual personal, and household income) and quality of life (QOL) andthe mediating roles of social support and social constraints (objective andsubjective conditions that constrain individuals from disclosing cancer concerns)in these associations among Chinese American breast cancer survivors (CABCS).METHODS: Ninety-six CABCS completed questionnaires assessing these variables.RESULTS: After controlling for stage of cancer, annual personal and householdincome had indirect effects on QOL through social support, and education showedindirect effect on QOL through social support and social constraints. Subscaleanalyses indicated that controlling for years of immigration, annual personal andhousehold income showed indirect effect on functional well-being through socialsupport. When controlling for stage of cancer and income, education showedindirect effects on physical well-being through social support and socialconstraints and showed both direct and indirect effects on breast cancer concernsthrough social constraints.CONCLUSION: This study suggested that socioeconomic indicators, education, andincome could be associated with different aspects of QOL through uniqueinterpersonal mechanisms among CABCS. Our findings implied that increasing socialsupport and reducing social constraints when implementing psychosocialinterventions for CABCS may help to address the SES-related health disparities.Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4719 PMID: 29603490
