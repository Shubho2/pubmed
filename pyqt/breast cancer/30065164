It was thenevaluated for cytotoxicity in vitro against human lung cancer (A549), epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2), hepatocellular carcinoma (C3A), breastadenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. A combination on thequinazoline and indole moieties of a 2-phenyl and 2-(4-fluorophenyl) rings incompound 4b; 2-(4-fluorophenyl) and 3-chlorophenyl rings in compound 4f; or thetwo 2-(4-fluorophenyl) rings in compound 4g, resulted in significant and moderateactivity against the Caco-2 and C3A cell lines. The indole-aminoquinazolinehybrids compounds 4f and 4g induced apoptosis in Caco-2 and C3A cells, and werealso found to exhibit moderate (IC50 = 52.5 nM) and significant (IC50 = 40.7 nM) inhibitory activity towards epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) againstgefitinib (IC50 = 38.9 nM). Molecular docking suggests that 4a‚Åªh could bind tothe ATP region of EGFR like erlotinib.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19082232 PMID: 30065164
