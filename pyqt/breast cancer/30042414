Here, we show that BRCA1 hasa synthetic lethality interaction with an epigenetics regulator, bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET). BET inhibition led to gene expression changesreversing MYC-dependent transcription repression of a redox regulator,thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), via switching the promoter occupant fromMYC to MondoA:MLX complex. Reversing the MYC-TXNIP axis inhibited thioredoxinactivity and elevated cellular oxidative stress, causing DNA damages that aredetrimental to BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells. Tumor xenograft models andbreast cancer clinical data analyses further demonstrated an in vivo syntheticlethality interaction and clinical association between BET/TXNIP and BRCA1deficiency in the survival of breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0408-8 PMID: 30042414
