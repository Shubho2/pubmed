The study investigated this instantaneousperception of an abnormality, known as a "gist" response, when 23 radiologistsviewed prior mammograms of women that were reported as normal, but laterdiagnosed with breast cancer at subsequent screening. Five categories of caseswere included: current cancer-containing mammograms, current mammograms of thenormal breast contralateral to the cancer, prior mammograms of normal cases,prior mammograms with visible cancer signs in a breast from women who wereinitially reported as normal, but later diagnosed with breast cancer atsubsequent screening in the same breast, and prior mammograms without any visiblecancer signs from women labelled as initially normal but subsequently diagnosedwith cancer. Our findings suggest that readers can distinguish patients who were diagnosed with cancer, from individuals without breast cancer (normal category), at above-chance levels based on a half-second glimpse of the mammogram evenbefore any lesion becomes visible on the mammogram. Although 20 of the 23radiologists demonstrated this ability, radiologists' abilities for perceivingthe gist of the abnormal varied between the readers and appeared to be linked to expertise. These results could have implications for identifying women of higher than average risk of a future malignancy event, thus impacting upon tailoredscreening strategies.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-26100-5 PMCID: PMC5992208PMID: 29880817
