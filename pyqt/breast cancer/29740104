The aim of this study was tocompare the setup accuracy of optical surface imaging by the Sentinel system withcone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) imaging currently used in our clinic forpatients received BCS. Two optical surface scans were acquired before andimmediately after couch movement correction. The correlation between the setuperrors as determined by the initial optical surface scan and CBCT was analyzed.The deviation of the second optical surface scan from the reference planning CTwas considered an estimate for the residual errors for the new method for patientsetup correction. The consequences in terms for necessary planning target volume (PTV) margins for treatment sessions without setup correction applied. Weanalyzed 145 scans in 27 patients treated for early stage breast cancer. Thesetup errors of skin marker based patient alignment by optical surface scan andCBCT were correlated, and the residual setup errors as determined by the optical surface scan after couch movement correction were reduced. Optical surfaceimaging provides a convenient method for improving the setup accuracy for breast cancer patient without unnecessary imaging dose.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25644-w PMCID: PMC5940773PMID: 29740104
