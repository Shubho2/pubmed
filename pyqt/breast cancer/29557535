In this study, we sought to investigate the association betweenthe molecular sub-classifications and breast-specific Graded PrognosticAssessment (GPA, which includes the Karnofsky performance status, molecularsubtypes, and age as its indices) and the outcomes of breast cancer patients who received WB re-irradiation.METHODS: Twenty-three breast cancer patients who received WB re-irradiation forrelapsed and progressive intracranial lesions after first-course WBRT between2004 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided according tothe 4 molecular subtypes of luminal A/B (hormone receptor [HR]+/human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-), luminal HER2 (HR+/HER2+), HER2 (HR-/HER2+),and triple negative (HR-/HER2-). The clinical and radiological responses andsurvival rates after WB re-irradiation were analyzed.RESULTS: At 1 month after WB re-irradiation, 13 of 23 patients (56.5%) exhibited disappearance or alleviation of neurological symptoms. The median survival timeafter WB re-irradiation was 2.93 months (95% confidence interval [CI],1.79-4.08). After WB re-irradiation, patients with HER2-negative tumors hadpoorer median survival times than those with HER2-positive tumors (2.23 vs. 3.0months, respectively; p = 0.022). Furthermore, patients with high breast GPAscores (2.5-4.0, n = 11) had longer median survivals than those with low-scores(0-2.0, n = 12) after WB re-irradiation (4.37 vs. 1.57 months, respectively;p < 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: WB re-irradiation may be a feasible treatment option for certainbreast cancer patients who develop brain metastatic lesions after first-courseWBRT when these lesions are ineligible for radiosurgery or surgery.DOI: 10.1007/s11060-018-2833-5 PMID: 29557535
