To evaluate theassociation of body mass index (BMI) with cancer risk in diabetic patients mayimprove current understanding of potential mechanisms.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 51,004 newly diagnosedT2DM patients derived from an electronic health record (EHR) database of Minhang district in Shanghai, China. Incident cancer cases and all-cause deaths occurred before September 30, 2015 were identified by linking with the Shanghai CancerRegistry and the Shanghai Vital Statistics. To examine the potential non-linearand linear relationships of BMI and cancer risk, Cox proportional hazard modelswith and without restricted cubic spline functions were used, respectively.RESULTS: A non-linear association was observed between BMI and overall cancerincidence in men younger than 60 years old (p for non-linearity = 0.009).Compared with those having BMI of 25.0 kg/m2, the cancer risk increased in those with either lower or higher BMI. In women older than 60 years old, lineardose-response relationships were observed between BMI and the risk of bothoverall cancer and breast cancer. As each unit increase in BMI, the overallcancer risks elevated by 3% (95%CI: 1-5%) and the breast cancer risks increasedby 7% (95%CI: 1-13%). No significant association was observed between BMI andother common cancer sites.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the effect of BMI on cancer risk in Chinesepatients with T2DM may vary by gender, age and cancer subtypes, suggestingdifferent underlying biological mechanisms.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4675-0 PMCID: PMC6080536PMID: 30081866
