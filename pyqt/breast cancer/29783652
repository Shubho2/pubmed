Estradiol has been associated with hormone responsive breastcancers. There is, however, a paucity of information on the role of sex hormones,gonadotropins, and thyroid hormone in non-hormone responsive breast cancer. This study aimed to determine differences in the serum levels of sex hormones,gonadotropins, thyroid hormones, and endocrine disruptors (lead, cadmium, andarsenic) in Nigerian women with hormone responsive and non-hormone responsivebreast cancers. Seventy-nine non-pregnant women aged 28⁻80 years withhistologically confirmed breast cancer were recruited, pre-therapy, into thiscross-sectional study. They comprised 52 premenopausal women and 27postmenopausal women recruited from the Surgical Oncology Clinic of theDepartment of Surgery, University College Hospital, Ibadan. Comparison ofbiochemical parameters were based on the positivity (+) and negativity (-) ofestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epithelialreceptor-2 (HER-2). Estradiol, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), free thyroxine (FT₄), free triiodothyronine (FT₃), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were determined using enzyme immunoassay (EIA).Serum lead, cadmium and arsenic were determined using atomic absorptionspectrophotometry (AAS). Expression of ER, PR and HER2 were determined usingimmunohistochemistry. Data was analyzed using Mann-Whitney U-test and multipleregression, with p < 0.05 considered as being statistically significant.Estradiol and progesterone were significantly higher in breast cancerparticipants with ER- and PR- compared with those with ER⁺ and PR⁺ breast cancer (p < 0.05). Follicle stimulating hormone and LH levels were significantly higher in participants with ER⁺ and PR⁺ breast cancer compared with participants withER- and PR- breast cancer (p < 0.05). Arsenic was inversely related with TSH inpremenopausal participants with ER- and PR- (β = -0.305; β = -0.304,respectively). Sex hormones and gonadotropins appear to be involved in thepathogenesis of triple negative and luminal breast cancer, respectively.DOI: 10.3390/medsci6020037 PMCID: PMC6024786PMID: 29783652
