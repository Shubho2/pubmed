Theexpressions of ER, CD34 and p53 in cancer tissue and corresponding canceradjacentnormal tissue were detected by immunohistochemical staining, and the colorDoppler ultrasonographic features of patients were observed and analysed bySpearman correlation test.RESULTS: The positive rates of ER, CD34 and p53 expressions in cancer tissue ofthe case group were 46.5, 50 and 52.3%, respectively, significantly higher than1.7% of the control group (p<0.05). The expressions of ER, CD34 and p53 in thecancer tissue of case group were correlated with the existence of calcification, spicule sign and lymph node metastasis detected by Doppler ultrasound (p<0.05),but not associated with tumor diameter and morphology (p>0.05). Spearmancorrelation test indicated positive correlation between expressions of ER andCD34 in cancer tissue of the case group (r=0.703, p<0.05); ER expression waspositively associated with p53 expression (r=0.716, p<0.05) and CD34 expressionwas positively related to p53 expression (r=0.684, p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The expressions of ER, CD34 and p53 have significant roles in theoccurrence and development of breast cancer. There is a certain correlationbetween expressions of ER, CD34 and p53 of breast cancer and color Dopplerultrasonographic features. The expression levels of ER, CD34 and p53 in breastcancer tissue can be evaluated by color Doppler ultrasonographic features, which is conducive to assessing the prognosis of these patients.PMID: 29745079
