We usedcommercial software employing the Clarkson algorithm for verification after avalidation study of measurement and software comparisons was performed. The dosesgenerated by the treatment planning systems (TPSs) were retrospectively analyzed using the verification software.RESULTS: Mean ± two standard deviations of all locations were 1.0 ± 3.6%. Therewere larger differences for breast (4.0 ± 4.0%) and for lung (2.5 ± 5.8%). Atotal of 80% of the fields with differences over 5% of the action level involved breast and lung targets, with 7.2 ± 5.4%. Inter-institutional comparisons showed various systematic differences for field shape for breast and differences in the fields were attributable to differences in reference point placement for lung.The large differences for breast and lung are partially attributable todifferences in the methods used to correct for heterogeneity.CONCLUSIONS: The 5% action level may be feasible for verification; however, anunderstanding of larger differences in breast and lung plans is important inclinical practice. Based on the inter-institutional comparisons, care must betaken when determining an institution-specific action level from plans withdifferent field shape settings and incorrectly placed reference points.Copyright © 2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.
