It isunclear whether symptoms persist over time as data comparing long-term survivors to controls are lacking. We compared sexual functioning in long-term breastcancer survivors (BCS) to controls and determined the impact of adjuvant therapy on sexual health.METHODS: A cohort of women with localized BC (1989-1996) was prospectivelyfollowed. BCS and controls (2005-2007) completed self-reported questionnaires.Sexual health was measured with the Sexual Activity Questionnaire (SAQ).Vasomotor, gynecological, and bladder symptoms were scored using the MenopausalSymptom Scale. Regression analysis was used to compare groups, with adjustmentfor age and secondly menopausal status.RESULTS: BCS (n = 248, 87%) and controls (n = 159, 95%) completed the SAQ at amedian time from diagnosis of 12.5 years. BCS were older (62 vs 59 years,p = 0.0004) and more likely to be menopausal (94 vs 86%, p = 0.0025). Sexualactivity did not differ significantly between BCS and controls, but when adjustedfor menopausal status, pre/peri-menopausal BCS were less likely to be sexuallyactive than pre/peri-controls (odds ratio OR 0.12, p = 0.012). In those sexually active, no significant differences were noted on the SAQ Pleasure, Discomfort,and Habit scales. BCS reported worse gynecological symptoms andpre/peri-menopausal patients had more bladder complaints (standardized effectsize 0.36 p = 0.002 and 1.11, p = 0.011). Adjuvant treatments were notsignificantly associated with sexual function, but BCS treated with chemotherapy reported worse gynecological symptoms.CONCLUSION: Sexual health and uro-genital symptom counseling should be providedto BCS, particularly pre/peri-menopausal patients, even at long-term follow-up.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4894-8 PMID: 30027300
