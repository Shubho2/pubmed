The presentstudy aimed at comparing hematological parameters, iron levels, and oxidativestress in women with and without breast cancer. Methods: The participants in thiscase-control study were 55 women, of whom 26 were new cases of breast cancer(confirmed by biopsy) as the case, and 29 without cancer (confirmed bymammography) as the control group. All participants underwent blood testing forcomplete blood count (CBC (free iron, ferritin, total iron binding capacity) TIBC(2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and Malondialdehyde (MDA). Results: Themean±SD age of the participants was 44.25±9.82 years, and there was nosignificant difference between groups. Also, no statistically significantdifference was found between the 2 groups in variables, except the meancorpuscular volume of red cells (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and mean cell hemoglobin (MCH). The use of iron supplements wassignificantly higher in the control than in the case group (p= 0. 01), with anodds ratio of 0.19% (95% CI: 0.45-0.7). The mean serum DPPH was significantlyhigher in the control than in the case group (p= 0. 006), but comparison of serumMDA showed no significant difference between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Irondeficiency anemia was greater in patients with breast cancer than in thosewithout it. Moreover, iron supplementation appears to have a protective effectagainst breast cancer incidence. In addition, serum DPPH, as a total antioxidant index, was significantly higher in the control group.DOI: 10.14196/mjiri.31.114 PMCID: PMC6014764PMID: 29951415
