Information aboutthe use and potential health effects of CT scan imaging among young people inSpain is scarce.OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to estimate the number of radiation-related cancercases which can be expected due to the use of CT scanning in Spanish children andyoung adults in a single year (2013).METHODS: The 2013 distribution of number and types of CT scans performed in youngpeople was obtained for Catalonia and extrapolated to the whole Spain. Organdoses were estimated based on the technical characteristics of 17,406 CTexaminations extracted from radiology records. Age and sex-specific data oncancer incidence and life tables were obtained for the Spanish population. Ageand sex-specific risk models developed by the Committee on Health Risks ofExposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiations (BEIR VII) and Berrington deGonzalez were used, together, with the dose estimates to derive the lifetimeattributable risks of cancer in Spain due to one year of CT scanning and project the number of future cancer cases to be expected.RESULTS: In 2013, 105,802 CT scans were estimated to have been performed inpeople younger than age 21. It was estimated that a total of 168.6 cancer cases(95% CrI: 30.1-421.1) will arise over life due to the ionising radiation exposurereceived during these CTs. Lifetime attributable risks per 100,000 exposedpatients were highest for breast and lung cancer. The largest proportion of CTswas to the head and neck and hence the highest numbers of projected cancer cases were of thyroid and oral cavity/pharynx.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the undeniable medical effectiveness of CT scans, this risk assessment suggests a small excess in cancer cases which underlines the need for justification and optimisation in paediatric scanning. Given the intrinsicuncertainties of these risk projection exercises, care should be taken wheninterpreting the predicted risks.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..
