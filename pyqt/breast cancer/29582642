Email: pornpun.viv@ mahidol.ac.thDespite a discovery of hormonal pathways regulating breast cancer, a definitivecure for the disease requires further identification of alternative targets that provide a hormone-independent support. Apart from their role in inflammatorydiseases, cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptor antagonists (LTRAs) decrease therisk of lung cancer in asthma patients and inhibit tumor progression in severalmalignancies. In the present study, we evaluate the effects of two chemicallydifferent, clinically relevant LTRAs (montelukast and zafirlukast) in a triplenegative breast cancer cell line, MDAMB- 231. We found that these two LTRAsreduced breast cancer cell viability in a dose-dependent manner with the 50%inhibitory concentration (IC50) between 5-10 Î¼M. Although both LTRAs have severalpharmacological properties in common, we noticed that montelukast mainly induced apoptosis, while zafirlukast mainly exerted its action on cell cycle. However,the precise mechanisms responsible for such different effects remain unclear. In summary, our results suggest that CysLT plays a role in proliferation andsurvivability of breast cancer cells in the absence of hormonal stimuli.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.3.833 PMCID: PMC5980863PMID: 29582642
