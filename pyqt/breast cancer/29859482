Thedistance between the shallowest part of the breast tumor and the front end of thepectoralis major muscle on MRI was considered as the tumor-to-chest walldistance.RESULTS: Twenty-four tumors (8.3%) were not visualized via DbPET. Thetumor-to-chest wall distance for undetectable tumors was shorter than that of thedetectable tumors (23.0 mm vs 38.5 mm, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysisindicated that proximity to the chest wall and low-grade tumors were independent predicting factors for undetectable cancers. Among the 24 undetectable cancers,15 tumors were proximal to the chest wall, suggesting that they were outside orat the edge of field of view (FOV), and 7 were low-grade tumors, suggestinginsignificant 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake.CONCLUSIONS: The factors of undetectable breast cancers on DbPET are classifiedinto two types; outside or at the edge of FOV and insignificant FDG uptake.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
