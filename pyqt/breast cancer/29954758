We performedsimultaneous multi-parameter measurement of breast sex steroids, breastepithelial cytology, and DNA methylation in 119 healthy women (54 pre- and 65postmenopausal) without a history of breast cancer. Random fine needle aspiration(rFNA) of the breast was performed simultaneously with blood collection. Breastsamples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry forestrone, estradiol, progesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone. Bloodsamples were assayed for estradiol and progesterone by immunoassay.Cytomorphology was classified using the Masood Score, and DNA methylation ofeight genes was analyzed using quantitative multiplexed methylation-specific PCR,and expressed as the cumulative methylation index (CMI). Serum and breastconcentrations of estradiol and progesterone showed significant correlation(Spearman r= 0.34, adjusted p= 0.001 and r= 0.69, adjusted p &lt; 0.0006,respectively). Progesterone concentration was significantly higher in thepremenopausal breast (adjusted p &lt; 0.0008), and showed a luteal surge. Breast estrone and estradiol concentrations did not differ significantly by menopause,but androstenedione concentration was higher in the breasts of postmenopausalwomen (p= 0.026 and adjusted p= 0.208). Breast androgens were significantlycorrelated with breast density (Spearman r = 0.27, adjusted p= 0.02 fortestosterone) and CMI (Spearman r= 0.3, adjusted p= 0.038 for androstenedione).Our data indicate that future larger studies of breast steroid hormones alongwith other parameters are feasible. Significant associations of breast androgenconcentrations with breast density and gene methylation warrant future study.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-17-0323 PMID: 29954758
