Electronic address: rmyygc@126.com.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors and one of theleading causes of cancer-related death in both men and women. The prognosis ofCRC remains poor due to the advanced stage and cancer metastasis at the time ofdiagnosis. However, the exact mechanism of tumorigenesis in CRC remains unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which refer to transcripts longer than 200nucleotides that are not translated into protein, are known to play importantroles in multiple human cancers. Lnc-DILC is reported to be an important tumorsuppressor gene and its inactivation is closely associated with liver cancer stemcells. However, the role of lnc-DILC in CRC remains to be elucidated. In thepresent study, we observed that lnc-DILC overexpression inhibited the growth and metastasis of CRC cells. Consistently, lnc-DILC knockdown facilitated theproliferation and metastasis of CRC cells. Mechanically, lnc-DILC suppressed CRC cell progression via IL-6/STAT3 signaling inactivation. More importantly, thespecific STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 and IL-6R inhibitor tocilizumab abolished thediscrepancy of growth and metastasis capacity between lnc-DILC-interference CRCcells and control cells, which further confirmed that IL-6/STAT3 signaling wasrequired in lnc-DILC-disrupted CRC cell growth and metastasis. Taken together,our results suggest that lnc-DILC is a novel CRC suppressor and may prove to bean inhibitor of CRC progression by inactivating IL-6/STAT3 signaling.Copyright Â© 2018.
