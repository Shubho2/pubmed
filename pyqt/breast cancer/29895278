Here, we aimed atinvestigating the prognostic value of circulating testosterone in associationwith patient's body mass index (BMI).METHODS: Circulating testosterone and BMI were evaluated at breast cancerdiagnosis in 460 estrogen receptor (ER)-positive postmenopausal patients. Localrelapse, distant metastasi(e)s and contralateral breast cancer were consideredrecurrence events. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to evaluate iftestosterone levels differed within subgroups of categorical tumourcharacteristics. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was fitted toestimate the impact of standard prognostic factors on relapse-specific hazardratio (HR). After backward selection, a model including continuous testosteronelevel, BMI categories (< 25, normal-weight; =25-30, overweight; ≥30 kg/m2,obese), tumour size and lymph nodes number was fitted. Furthermore, Cox modelsprovided the relapse-specific HRs for median, third quartile and 95th percentile compared to the first quartile of testosterone levels, stratified by BMIcategories.RESULTS: During a median follow up of 6.3 years, 45 patients relapsed.Testosterone levels significantly increased across BMI categories (p = 0.001).Both circulating testosterone and BMI were positively associated with diseasefree survival (p = 0.005 and p = 0.021, respectively). A significant interaction was found between testosterone and BMI (p = 0.006). For normal-weight women,testosterone concentration around median (0.403 ng/mL) or third quartile(0.532 ng/mL) showed a high significant HR of relapse (5.52; 95% CI:1.65-18.49and 4.55; 95% CI:1.09-18.98, respectively). Overweight patients showed increased HR at increasing testosterone levels, reaching a significant high HR (4.68; 95%CI:1.39-15.70) for testosterone values of 0.782 ng/mL (95th percentile). Forobese patients HR decreased (not significantly) at increased testosteroneconcentrations, explaining the interaction between testosterone levels and BMIcategories.CONCLUSIONS: In ER-positive postmenopausal breast cancer patients, hightestosterone levels are associated with worse prognosis in normal-weight andoverweight women, whereas in obese seems to be associated with a better outcome. Although the results require further validation, they suggest that assessment of circulating testosterone and BMI could help to identify postmenopausalER-positive patients at higher risk of relapse and potentially open newtherapeutic strategies.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4558-4 PMCID: PMC5998599PMID: 29895278
