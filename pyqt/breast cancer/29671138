Ingrid-lizarraga@uiowa.edu.BACKGROUND: High-volume single-institution studies support the oncologic safetyof nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM). Concerns remain regarding the increasedpotential for complications, recurrence, and delays to subsequent adjuvanttherapy. A national database was used to examine treatment and outcomes for NSMpatients.METHODS: Women undergoing unilateral NSM or skin sparing mastectomy (SSM) forstage 0-4 breast cancer from 2004 to 2013 were identified from the NationalCancer Database. Demographic and oncologic characteristics, short-term outcomesand time to local and systemic treatment were compared.RESULTS: NSM was performed on 8173 patients: 8.7% were node positive, and forstage 1-4 disease, 10.6% were triple negative (TN) and 15.3% were HER2-positive. NSM patients were less likely than SSM patients to receive chemotherapy [CT](37.4 vs. 43.4%) or radiation [PMRT] (15.6 vs. 16.9%), and were also more likely to present with clinically early-stage disease. NSM patients with high-riskfeatures were more likely to receive CT in the neoadjuvant [NCT] than adjuvantsetting [AC] (OR 3.76, 1.81, and 1.99 for clinical N2/3, TN, and HER2-positivedisease, all p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, NSM patients had a higher rateof pathologic complete response [pCR] (OR 1.41, p < 0.001). Readmission rate,positive margin rate and time to CT, PMRT or hormonal therapy were not increased for NSM compared to SSM patients.CONCLUSIONS: Over one third of NSM patients received chemotherapy and/orradiation. NSM patients with high-risk features were more likely to receive NACand obtain a pCR. NSM patients did not experience worse outcomes or delayedadjuvant therapy compared to SSM.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6446-1 PMID: 29671138
