Kt-IgM-8 was produced via hybridoma from Tn-PS A1hyperimmunized Jackson Laboratory C57BL/6 mice, splenocytes and the murinemyeloma cell line Sp2/0Ag14 with subsequent cloning on methyl cellulosesemi-solid media. This in-house generated monoclonal antibody negates bindinginfluenced from peptides, proteins, and lipids and preferentially bindsmonovalent Tn antigen as noted by ELISA, FACS, and glycan array technologies.Kt-IgM-8 demonstrated in vitro and in vivo tumor killing against the MichiganCancer Foundation breast cell line 7 (MCF-7). In vitro tumor killing was observedusing an LDH assay that measured antibody-induced complement-dependentcytotoxicity and these results were validated in an in vivo passive immunotherapyapproach using an MCF-7 cell line-derived xenograft model. Kt-IgM-8 is effective in killing tumor cells at 30% cytotoxicity, and furthermore, it demonstratedapproximately 40% reduction in tumor growth in the MCF-7 model.DOI: 10.1007/s00262-018-2206-0 PMID: 30030557
