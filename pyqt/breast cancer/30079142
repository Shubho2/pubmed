Asignificant proportion of GOC patients display HER2 amplification, yet HER2inhibition in these patients has not displayed the success seen in HER2 amplifiedbreast cancer. Much of the current evidence surrounding HER2 has been obtainedfrom studies in breast cancer, and we are only recently beginning to improve our understanding of HER2-amplified GOC. Whilst there are numerous licensed HER2inhibitors in breast cancer, trastuzumab remains the only licensed HER2 inhibitorfor HER2-amplified GOC. Clinical trials investigating lapatinib, trastuzumabemtansine, pertuzumab and MM-111 in GOC have demonstrated disappointing resultsand have not yet changed the treatment paradigm. Trastuzumab deruxtecan may hold promise and is currently being investigated in phase II trials. HER2 amplifiedGOC differs from breast cancer due to inherent differences in the HER2amino-truncation and mutation rate, loss of HER2 expression, alterations in HER2 signalling pathways and differences in insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and MET expression. Epigenetic alterations involving different microRNA profiles inGOC as compared to breast cancer and intrinsic differences in the immuneenvironment are likely to play a role. The key to effective treatment of HER2amplified GOC lies in understanding these mechanisms and tailoring HER2inhibition for GOC patients in order to improve clinical outcomes.DOI: 10.4251/wjgo.v10.i7.159 PMCID: PMC6068859PMID: 30079142
