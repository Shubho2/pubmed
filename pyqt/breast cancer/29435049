Zinc-finger protein 224 (ZNF224), aKr√ºppel-associated-box-containing zinc finger protein, is known to serve acrucial function in integrating the transcriptional co-factors that activatetranscriptional regulation pathways in the cell. A previous study demonstratedthat ZNF224 enhances cell proliferation by downregulating the expression of p21and p53. The present study identified mediator complex subunit 28 (MED28) as apotential binding partner for ZNF224; this was confirmed byco-immunoprecipitation and a surface plasmon resonance assay. Additionally, theKRAB domain at the N-terminal of ZNF224 interacts with the MED domain of MED28.Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis revealed that ZNF224 associateswith MED28 in the nucleus. In addition, ZNF224 was rapidly degraded upontreatment with the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin (CPT). Transientoverexpression of MED28 inhibited the CPT-mediated degradation of ZNF224,resulting in increased colony formation by MCF-7 cells. The molecular mechanisms that underlie the biological outcomes of MED28 expression have not yet been fullyelucidated. The present study provides molecular evidence for the function ofZNF224 and MED28 in the DNA-damage response.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7718 PMCID: PMC5778905PMID: 29435049
