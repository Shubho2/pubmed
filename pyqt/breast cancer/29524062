Tissuemicroarray (TMA) slides were stained with two clones of PD-L1 antibodies (28-8and 22C3) and the percentage of positive membranous staining was scored. TILs of the full sections were also scored using percentage scale.RESULTS: Clone 28-8 had expression in ≥ 1% of the tumor cells in 25.7% of thecases, while clone 22C3 in ≥ 1% of the tumor cells was expressed in 11.5% of the cases. In the multivariate analysis, higher expression of PD-L1 (clone 28-8) intumor correlated with lower risk of tumor recurrence, with HR of 0.4 (p = 0.033).Higher level of TILs (> 15%) predicts better overall survival (OS) in allpatients with HR of 0.35 (p  = 0.0046). In the group of patients who were treatedwith trastuzumab-based adjuvant chemotherapy, lower PD-L1 (clone 28-8) expressionin TILs correlated with tumor recurrence (p  = 0.034). In the group of patientswho were treated with non-trastuzumab-based adjuvant chemotherapy, lower TILs andlower PD-L1 (clone 28-8) expression in tumor had borderline statisticalsignificance in association with tumor recurrence (p  = 0.064 and 0.083,respectively). In the group of patients who were treated with trastuzumab-basedadjuvant chemotherapy, PD-L1 or TILs was not statistically significant to predict5-year survival. In the group of patients who were treated withnon-trastuzumab-based adjuvant chemotherapy, low TILs (p = 0.009) correlated with5-year death due to disease.CONCLUSION: We conclude that PD-L1 may have prognostic significance in HER2+ BCs.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4745-7 PMCID: PMC6002907 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29524062
