China.The objective of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency ofultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis anddifferential diagnosis of mammary duct ectasia (MDE) and breast cancer. Thisretrospective study was performed on 35 patients with MDE and 105 patients withbreast cancer using US and MRI. Imaging features, semi-quantitative andquantitative parameters were analyzed to determine their diagnostic value for MDEand breast cancer. The average age of patients with breast cancer was increasedcompared with that of patients with MDE. There were no significant differences inlocal packages with or without tenderness ratio (P=0.259) and grade of colorDoppler flow imaging (P=0.273) between the two groups. However, the morphologicalchanges were significantly increased in breast cancer compared with MDE. Inaddition, there were significant diagnostic differences in US and MRI betweenbreast cancer and MDE, including resistance index, US elastography, time-signalintensity curve, apparent diffusion coefficient, early-stage enhancement ratio,peak-of-enhancement ratio and Tpeak (P<0.05). However, there were no observablesignificant diagnostic differences between US, MRI and US with MRI for MDE andbreast cancer (P=0.103, P=0.263 and P=0.403 respectively). Diagnosis of MDE andbreast cancer requires full evaluation of multiple parameters and morphologicalchanges of US and MRI to increase the diagnostic efficiency. US, MRI and US with MRI were all of diagnostic value for MDE and breast cancer, while US with MRI hadthe highest efficacy.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7514 PMCID: PMC5777102PMID: 29434865
