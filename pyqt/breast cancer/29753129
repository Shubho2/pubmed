Genomics hasprovided numerous valuable data on driver mutations and risk loci; however, itremains a formidable challenge to transform these data into therapeutic agents.Transcriptomics describes the multifarious expression patterns of both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which facilitates the deciphering of genomic codes. In this review, we take breast cancer as an example to demonstrate the applications of these rich RNA resources in precision medicine exploration. These include the use of mRNA profiles in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtyping to inform corresponding candidate targeted therapies; current advancements and achievementsof high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screening technologies in breastcancer; and microRNAs as functional signatures for defining cell identities andregulating the biological activities of breast cancer cells. We summarize thebenefits of transcriptomic analyses in breast cancer management and propose that unscrambling the core signaling networks of cancer may be an important task ofmultiple-omic data integration for precision oncology.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
