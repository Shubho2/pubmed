In metastatic lesions, tumor cellsinteract with many different cell types, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and mesenchymal stem cells, resulting in an osteoblastic or osteolytic phenotype.However, the mechanisms responsible for the modification of bone remodeling have not been fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are transferred between cells viaexosomes and serve as intercellular communication tools, and numerous studieshave demonstrated that cancer-secreted miRNAs are capable of modifying the tumor microenvironment. Thus, cancer-secreted miRNAs can induce an osteoblastic orosteolytic phenotype in the bone metastatic microenvironment. In this study, weperformed a comprehensive expression analysis of exosomal miRNAs secreted byseveral human cancer cell lines and identified eight types of human miRNAs thatwere highly expressed in exosomes from osteoblastic phenotype-inducing prostatecancer cell lines. One of these miRNAs, hsa-miR-940, significantly promoted theosteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro by targeting ARHGAP1 and FAM134A Interestingly, although MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells arecommonly known as an osteolytic phenotype-inducing cancer cell line, theimplantation of miR-940-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells induced extensiveosteoblastic lesions in the resulting tumors by facilitating the osteogenicdifferentiation of host mesenchymal cells. Our results suggest that thephenotypes of bone metastases can be induced by miRNAs secreted by cancer cellsin the bone microenvironment.Copyright Â© 2018 the Author(s).
