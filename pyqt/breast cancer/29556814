We developed thisout-patient program using shared-care model with professional input and patientempowerment, so as to reduce patients' psychological burden from hospitalization and to improve the cost-effectiveness of management.METHOD: This is a prospective cohort study to compare the efficacy and safenessof the out-patient program when compared with traditional in-patient care.Patients with solid tumors, developed febrile neutropenia with MultinationalAssociation of Supportive Care in Cancer score of at least 21, and goodperformance status were included. After initial assessment and the first dose of oral antibiotics, patients were observed in the ambulatory center. Stablepatients were discharged home after 4 h of observation and nurse counseling.Patients' condition and clinical progress were regularly reviewed by specialistnurses within the following week by telephone and nurse clinic follow-up. Theprimary objective of the study is success rate, which defined as the resolutionof fever and infection, without hospitalization or any change in antibiotics.RESULTS: From September 2014 to December 2016, a total of 38 patients wereenrolled. Majority were female with breast cancer (97%). Two patients requiredhospitalization due to persistent fever. The success rate of the out-patientprogram was not significantly different from the historical in-patient cohort(94.9 versus 97.4%, p = 0.053). No mortality was observed. Patients' complianceto the program was 100%, to telephone follow-up, nurse clinic visits, and dailytemperature record.CONCLUSION: Out-patient management of patients with low-risk febrile neutropenia is effective and safe through implementation of a structured protocol with joint inputs and engagement from clinicians, oncology nurses, and patients.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4157-6 PMID: 29556814
