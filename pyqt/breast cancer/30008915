China.The partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in the tumor microenvironment directlyaffects tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy. In the present study, a lithiumphthalocyanine probe was implanted into MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, followedby transplant of the cells into nude mice. The present study used an electronparamagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry measuring technique to dynamically monitor PO2 in the tumor microenvironment prior to and following chemotherapy, and aimed to determine the precise time window in which the microenvironmental PO2 peakedfollowing chemotherapy. The results indicated that PO2 was significantly higherin breast cancer compared with control (P<0.05). Following four cycles ofchemotherapy, the activity of NADH dehydrogenase, succinate-cytochrome creductase and cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria of cells was significantlyreduced when compared with their activity prior to chemotherapy (P<0.05).Regional blood flow in tumor tissues undergoing chemotherapy was significantlylower than that prior to chemotherapy (P<0.05). The rate of cellular apoptosis inthe PO2 peak-based chemotherapy group was significantly greater than that in the conventional chemotherapy group after two and four cycles of chemotherapy(P<0.05). Tumor volume in the PO2 peak-based chemotherapy group was significantlyreduced compared with that in the 0.9% NaCl solution control and the conventionalchemotherapy groups after four cycles of chemotherapy (P<0.05). The tumorinhibitory rate of the experimental group was significantly higher than that ofthe conventional chemotherapy group (P<0.01). In conclusion, the present studymay provide guidance for the development of effective strategies depending ontumor-maximal response to chemotherapy in an oxygen-rich environment.Additionally, the present study aimed to establish a foundation for a clinicalnoninvasive assessment intended to guide treatment and formulate individualregimens, in order to improve cancer therapeutics, sensitivity monitoring andcurative effect estimation.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8911 PMCID: PMC6036430PMID: 30008915
