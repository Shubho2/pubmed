IFNγ-resistant melanoma cells very often lack functionalexpression of the IFNγ signaling pathway gene JAK2 due to gene deletions orinactivating gene mutations. Analyzing melanoma cell lines (n = 46, applyingnext-generation targeted sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays) aswell as available genomic data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) tumortissue samples (cutaneous melanoma n = 367, lung squamous cell carcinoma n = 501,bladder urothelial carcinoma n = 408, breast invasive carcinoma n = 768,colorectal adenocarcinoma n = 257), we demonstrate that the frequent chromosomal losses of the tumor suppressor CDKN2A in melanoma and other tumor entitiesenhance the susceptibility to IFNγ resistance by concomitant deletion of the JAK2gene (odds ratio = 223.17, 95% confidence interval = 66.91 to 1487.38, two-sided P = 7.6×10-46). Tumors with JAK2 mutations or homozygous JAK2 deletionsdemonstrate allelic losses covering both CDKN2A and JAK2. This suggests thatpatients with tumor chromosomal CDKN2A losses are susceptible to developingimmunotherapy resistance and should be screened for JAK2 deficiency prior to and under immune checkpoint blocking therapy.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djx271 PMID: 29917141
