[Epub ahead ofprint]Successful Relief of a Male Breast Lymphedema by SupermicrosurgicalLymphaticovenular Anastomosis.Ayestaray B(1), Chrelias T.Author information: (1)From the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Sud FrancilienHospital, University Paris Sud XI, Evry, France.BACKGROUND: Breast lymphedema is a common issue after breast cancer surgery butremains understudied because it is difficult to be quantified. Untreated breastlymphedema may lead to severe form of delayed breast cellulitis.Supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenular anastomosis is one option for the treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema but has not been described for the treatment of breast lymphedema.METHODS: This report presented a rare case of male breast lymphedema secondary toaxillary lymph node dissection for the treatment of a forearm melanoma. Deeplymphatic vessels and adjacent venules were individualized under highmagnification in the periareolar area. Six lymphaticovenular anastomoses wereperformed using supermicrosurgical techniques. A clinical examination and avolume assessment under magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess theefficiency of surgery.RESULTS: Postoperative outcome was uneventful. The patient was followed-up during1 year. Swelling relief was clinically significant 3 months postoperatively. The pinch test reduction was 2 cm after 12 months. The breast volume reduction ratewas 47.2%.CONCLUSIONS: Supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenular anastomosis may be efficientfor the treatment of postoperative breast lymphedema, even in male patients.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001560 PMID: 29994879
