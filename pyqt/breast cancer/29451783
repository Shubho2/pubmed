The potential of SuFEx in drug discovery has juststarted to be explored. We report the first method of SuFEx chemistry for theconversion of phenolic compounds to their respective arylfluorosulfatederivatives in situ in 96-well plates. This method is compatible with automatedsynthesis and screening to quickly assess the biological activities of the insitu generated, crude products. Using this method, we perform late-stagefunctionalization of a panel of known anticancer drugs to generate thecorresponding arylfluorosulfates. These in situ generated arylfluorosulfates are directly tested in a cancer-cell growth inhibition assay in parallel with theirphenolic precursors. We discover three arylfluorosulfates that exhibit improvedanticancer cell proliferation activities compared to their phenol precursors.Among these three compounds, the fluorosulfate derivative of Fulvestrantpossesses significantly enhanced activity to down-regulate estrogen receptor (ER)expression in ER+ breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and the fluorosulfate derivative of Combretastatin A4-a general anticancer drug currently being evaluated underclinical trials-exhibits a 70-fold increase in potency in the drug resistantcolon cancer cell line HT-29.DOI: 10.1021/jacs.7b12788 PMID: 29451783  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
