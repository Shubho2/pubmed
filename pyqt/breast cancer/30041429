As embigin's roles in cancer remain elusive, we studied its biological functions andinteraction with extracellular S100A4 in prostate cancer progression. We found bya pull-down assay that embigin is a novel receptor for S100A4, which is one ofthe vital cancer microenvironment milleu. Binding of extracellular S100A4 toembigin mediates prostate cancer progression by inhibition of AMPK activity,activation of NF-κB, MMP9 and mTORC1 signaling, and inhibition of autophagy,which increase prostate cancer cell motility. We also found that embigin promotesprostate cancer growth, spheroid- and colony-forming ability, and survival uponchemotherapy independently of S100A4. An in vivo growth mouse model confirmed theimportance of embigin and its cytoplasmic tail in mediating prostate tumorgrowth. Moreover, embigin and p21WAF1 can be used to predict survival of prostatecancer patients. Our results demonstrated for the first time that theS100A4-embigin/AMPK/mTORC1/p21WAF1 and NF-κB/MMP9 axis is a vital oncogenicmolecular cascade for prostate cancer progression. We proposed that embigin andp21WAF1 could be used as prognostic biomarkers and a strategy to inhibitS100A4-embigin binding could be a therapeutic approach for prostate cancerpatients.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10070239 PMCID: PMC6071117PMID: 30041429
