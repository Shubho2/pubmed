The CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression was found to be correlated with poor overall survival in invasive breast carcinomapatients. Here, we sought to investigate the expression levels of the CXCR4-CXCchemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) chemokine axis and their association withclinicopathologic features and lymph node metastasis in invasive breastcarcinoma.Materials and Methods: The expression of the CXCR4-CXCL12 chemokine axis andmetastasis-related genes (E-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase 2 [MMP2]) wasmeasured by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction. The correlationwith various clinicopathologic parameters was analyzed.Results: We found upregulation of the CXCR4-CXCL12 chemokine axis in invasivebreast carcinoma samples compared with normal adjacent tissues. Moreover, weobserved that upregulation of this chemokine axis was correlated with tumorstages and lymph node metastasis of breast tumors. Interestingly, thiscorrelation was affected by the expression of human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2/neu. There is also a significant correlation between the expressionlevels of CXCR4-CXCL12 axis and metastasis-related genes (E-cadherin and MMP2) intumor samples with advanced stages of metastasis.Conclusion: These results suggest a key role for the CXCR4-CXCL12 chemokine axis in breast cancer progression and highlight the prognostic importance of thischemokine axis for breast cancer survival.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.177221 PMID: 29516917
