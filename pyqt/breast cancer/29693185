China.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in females worldwide.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15% of all breast cancer cases and has a poorer prognosis than other subtypes. Moreover, the treatment forbreast cancer, especially for TNBC, remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, noveltherapies are urgently needed. Microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are a class ofbiomarkers and therapeutic targets in many types of cancers. In the presentstudy, the expression of miR-384 was explored in GSE58606 and in fresh breastcancer tissues by qPCR. The results showed that miR-384 was decreased in breastcancer, especially in TNBC. The results of MTT, colony formation, soft agar,Transwell migration, wound healing and the tumorigenesis assay demonstranted thatoverexpression of miR-384 inhibited the proliferation and migration of breastcancer in vitro and in vivo; knockdown of miR-384 enhanced the proliferation and migration of breast cancer. In addition, luciferase assay showed that Activin Areceptor type 1 (ACVR1) was a direct target of miR-384 and is involved in theinhibitory effects of miR-384 on breast cancer progression. Furthermore, thisstudy indicated that ACVR1 activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway inbreast cancer. In conclusion, our findings revealed functional and mechanisticlinks between miR-384 and ACVR1 in the progression of breast cancer. miR-384 not only plays an important role in the progression of breast cancer, but has promiseas a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer especially for TNBC.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6385 PMCID: PMC5983929PMID: 29693185
