Epub2018 Feb 21.The overestimation and the inappropriate promotion of the benefits ofmammographic screening in breast cancer research and interventions in the GazaStrip.McPherson K(1), Al Waheidi S(2).Author information: (1)Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Oxford,Oxford, UK. Electronic address: klim.mcpherson@obs-gyn.ox.ac.uk.(2)King's College London, London, UK.BACKGROUND: There has been extensive debate about whether mammographic screening has done more good than harm. Recent reviews showed that women who undergomammographic screening are more likely to have a tumour that was an overdiagnosisand therefore would not cause them problems. In the Gaza Strip, a strong forum ofpeople advocate an increase in mammographic screening, and the aim of this study was to establish the evidence for this view.METHODS: Research papers that have focused on breast screening in the Gaza Strip or elsewhere in the occupied Palestinian territory were reviewed. Publishededucational material, including brochures, booklets, and short videos onmammographic screening, were also reviewed. A thematic analysis was done todocument the opinions of authors on the effect of mammography.FINDINGS: 11 studies and 20 sets of educational material were identified. Resultsof six cross-sectional studies showed that about 70% of Palestinian women hadnever had a mammogram, whereas data from one study showed that 90% of women inthe Gaza Strip were willing to undergo diagnostic mammography, but around 30% of them were willing to undergo mammographic screening. Some investigators arguedthat mammographic screening programmes would improve survival by more than 20% inthe Gaza Strip. The authors of two retrospective cohort studies concluded thatPalestinian women have low survival rates because of the poor availability ofmammography. Only three study groups mentioned harmful effects of mammographicscreening. All educational materials had clear information on the benefits ofmammographic screening but minimal information on its harms.INTERPRETATION: Research in the Gaza Strip overestimated the reduction in breast cancer mortality that can be attributable to mammographic screening, and thiswould encourage women to undergo screening without knowing that it could harmthem. The content of breast cancer educational material was misleading. Thisstudy shows that the information and advice given to women in the Gaza Strip isone-sided.FUNDING: None.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
