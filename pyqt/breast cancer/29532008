Central histopathology (N = 1643)review was undertaken to explore the relationship between these ten molecularsubtypes and traditional clinicopathological features. IntClust subtypes weresignificantly associated with histological type, tumour grade, receptor status,and lymphocytic infiltration (p < 0.0001). Lymph node status and NottinghamPrognostic Index [NPI] categories were also significantly associated withIntClust subtype. IntClust 3 was enriched for tubular and lobular carcinomas, thelatter largely accounting for the association with CDH1 mutations in thiscluster. Mucinous carcinomas were not present in IntClusts 5 or 10, but did notshow an association with any of the remaining IntClusts. In contrast,medullary-like cancers were associated with IntClust 10 (15/26). Hormonereceptor-positive tumours were scattered across all IntClusts. IntClust 5 wasdominated by HER2 positivity (127/151), including both hormone receptor-positive (60/72) and hormone receptor-negative tumours (67/77). Triple-negative tumourscomprised the majority of IntClust 10 (132/159) and around a quarter of IntClust 4 (52/217). Whilst the ten IntClust subtypes of breast cancer show characteristicpatterns of association with traditional clinicopathological variables, noIntClust can be adequately identified by these variables alone. Hence, theaddition of genomic stratification has the potential to enhance the biologicalrelevance of the current clinical evaluation and facilitate genome-guidedtherapeutic strategies.DOI: 10.1038/s41523-018-0056-8 PMCID: PMC5841292PMID: 29532008
