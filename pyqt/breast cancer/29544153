We, therefore, conducted the first nationwide breast cancer study toassess regional differences.METHODS: Cases were obtained from population-based cancer registries covering thecountry's Mainland (South, North, Centre), as well as the two Autonomous Regions (Azores and Madeira), for the time-period 1998 through 2011. Analyses wererestricted to ages 30-84 years and stratified by region. We used theage-period-cohort (APC) framework to complement standard descriptive techniquesand to forecast future trends. Estimable APC parameters included net drift,longitudinal age-specific incidence rate curves, and fitted age-specificincidence rate ratios.RESULTS: There were 71 545 breast cancer cases diagnosed in Portugal at ages30-84 years from 1998 to 2011. The South presented the highest age-standardizedrate (155.8/100 000), while the North presented the fastest rate of increase(3.6%/year). Age-specific statistical interactions were observed between regions.Younger women in the North revealed a decreased risk of developing breast cancer compared to women from the same age group in the South and Centre, while thatrisk was reversed in older women (p < 0.05). We estimate that from 2014 onwards, the North might rank first among all regions.CONCLUSION: The variant patterns observed could be due to a combination ofdifferent screening practices and/or exposure to risk factors across regions.Disease heterogeneity among younger and older women may also explain part of the differences in age-specific rates. These results justify continued monitoring of breast cancer incidence by region.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
