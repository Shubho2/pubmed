Although TNBCs harbor multiple hyperactive receptor tyrosine kinases(RTKs), RTK inhibitors have been largely ineffective in TNBC patients thus far.We developed a broadly effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC that is based oncombined inhibition of receptors that share the negative regulator PTPN12.Previously, we and others identified the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN12 as a tumorsuppressor that is frequently inactivated in TNBC. PTPN12 restrains several RTKs,suggesting that PTPN12 deficiency leads to aberrant activation of multiple RTKsand a co-dependency on these receptors. This in turn leads to the therapeutichypothesis that PTPN12-deficient TNBCs may be responsive to combined RTKinhibition. However, the repertoire of RTKs that are restrained by PTPN12 inhuman cells has not been systematically explored. By methodically identifying thesuite of RTK substrates (MET, PDGFRβ, EGFR, and others) inhibited by PTPN12, werationalized a combination RTK-inhibitor therapy that induced potent tumorregression across heterogeneous models of TNBC. Orthogonal approaches revealedthat PTPN12 was recruited to and inhibited these receptors after ligandstimulation, thereby serving as a feedback mechanism to limit receptor signaling.Cancer-associated mutation of PTPN12 or reduced PTPN12 protein levels diminished this feedback mechanism, leading to aberrant activity of these receptors.Restoring PTPN12 protein levels restrained signaling from RTKs, including PDGFRβ and MET, and impaired TNBC survival. In contrast with single agents, combinedinhibitors targeting the PDGFRβ and MET receptors induced the apoptosis in TNBCcells in vitro and in vivo. This therapeutic strategy resulted in tumorregressions in chemo-refractory patient-derived TNBC models. Notably, responsecorrelated with PTPN12 deficiency, suggesting that impaired receptor feedback mayestablish a combined addiction to these proto-oncogenic receptors. Takentogether, our data provide a rationale for combining RTK inhibitors in TNBC andother malignancies that lack receptor-activating mutations.DOI: 10.1038/nm.4507 PMID: 29578538
