Helena.Jernstrom@med.lu.se.Overweight and obesity are increasing worldwide, but the extent in breast cancer patients is unknown. The two aims were to study secular trends in preoperativebody mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and breast volume and their impactson clinical outcome. BMI, waist circumference, and breast volume were measuredpreoperatively in 24-99-year-old primary breast cancer patients (n = 640) inSweden 2002-2016. The measurements were analyzed alone and combined in relationto recurrence and overall survival (OS). BMI, waist circumference, and breastvolume increased 2002-2016 (ptrends < 0.0001). Of these, a breast volume ≥ 850 mLwas associated with the strongest recurrence-risk (adjusted hazard ratio [adjHR] 1.67; 95% CI 1.17-2.39), especially combined with waist circumference ≥ 80 cm(adjHR 2.07; 95% CI 1.25-3.44), while BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 or large waist circumferenceconferred almost a twofold risk for death (both Log-Rank p ≤ 0.0001).Chemotherapy seemed to counteract the negative impact of a high BMI or largewaist circumference on OS. Large breast volume was the strongest predictor forrecurrence in all treatment groups. In conclusion, preoperative BMI, waistcircumference, and breast volume increased between 2002 and 2016. Larger bodysize negatively impacted breast cancer-free interval and OS. If confirmed, bodymeasurements may help select patients requiring more individualized treatment.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1042-z PMCID: PMC5999186PMID: 29804217
