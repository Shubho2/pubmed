The proteinimprinted poly(Toluidine Blue) film was grown in a pre-formed Toluidine Blue (TB)tailed SAM at the AuSPE surface, which greatly enhanced the stability againstdegradation of the Molecular Imprinted Polymer (MIP) film at the electrodesurface. The MIP receptor film recognition ability towards the protein wasinvestigated by fitting data to Freundlich isotherm. The binding affinity (KF)obtained for the MIP system was significantly higher (~ 12-fold) to that obtainedfor the NIP system, demonstrating the success of the approach in creatingimprinted materials that specifically respond to CA 15-3 protein. The incubation of the MIP modified electrode with increasing concentration of protein (from0.10 U mL-1 to 1000 U mL-1) resulted in a decrease of the ferro/ferricyanideredox current. The device displayed linear response from 0.10 U mL-1 to100 U mL-1 and LODs below 0.10 U mL-1 were obtained from calibration curves builtin neutral buffer and diluted artificial serum, using DPV technique, enabling thedetection of the protein biomarker at clinically relevant levels. The developedMIP biosensor was applied to the determination of CA 15-3 in spiked serum sampleswith satisfactory results. The developed device provides a new strategy forsensitive, rapid, simple and cost-effective screening of CA 15-3 biomarker.Importantly, the overall approach seems suitable for point-of-care (PoC) use inclinical context.Copyright © 2018.
