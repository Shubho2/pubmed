Studies of cancer survivors reveal positive effects of physical activity (PA) on reducingrisk of cancer recurrence, other chronic conditions, and secondary cancer. Fewnationally representative studies have examined how physical activity levels haveaffected survivors' annual economic burden in the United States. Leisure-timephysical activity data from the National Health Interview Survey was linked tohealth care expenditure data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data(2008-2012). We calculated per-person annual total medical expenditures foridentified colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer survivors. We conductedmultivariable analyses controlled for survival years and other sociodemographicvariables. Generalized linear models were performed to measure correlationbetween medical expenditure and PA level using STATA 14. All analyses considered the complex survey design and were conducted in 2017. Of 1015 cancer survivorssampled, 30% (n = 305) adhered to physical activity recommendation, while theother 70% (n = 710) did not. Multivariable-adjusted expenditure in adherencegroup was $9108.8 (95% CI 7410.9-10,806.7) versus 12,899.1 (95% CI11,450.2-14,348) in non-adherence group. Stratified analyses revealed cancersurvivors who adhered to their PA recommendation saved $4686.1 (1-5 years'survival time) and $2874.5 (11 or more years' survival time) on average for totalhealth care expenditure, respectively. Analyses of the national representativesample revealed that the economic burden of survivors from the three mostprevalent cancers is substantial. Increasing survivor's PA to guidelines mayreduce U.S. health care expenditure.DOI: 10.1016/j.pmedr.2018.01.003 PMCID: PMC5840848PMID: 29527464
