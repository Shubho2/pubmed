Here we consider theelevated risk of breast and ovarian cancer. There is a clear indication for such surgery in healthy women with a pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation. For these patients, a risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy leads to a verifiable reduction in mortalityfrom breast cancer, particularly for young patients. In most cases, surgery iscombined with breast reconstruction. The pros and cons of surgical treatment and the different surgical techniques have to be explained to and carefullyconsidered with the patient. As yet, no unequivocal data for the benefits ofintensifying early detection have been ascertained with respect to mortality frombreast carcinoma. In index patients with a BRCA mutation, the surgical treatment should depend on the prognosis of the primary disease. A lower age at onset and abetter prognosis of the primary disease make a contralateral mastectomy (CPM)more reasonable. In the case of BRCA mutation-related cancer, a reduction ofmortality through CPM has been proven. A risk-reducing adnexectomy is basicallyrecommended for BRCA mutation carriers. Healthy premenopausal women need asubsequent hormone replacement therapy. The prognosis of the patients isdominated by the ovarian carcinoma. This can be prevented by risk-reducingsalpingo-oophorectomy in 95% of the cases.DOI: 10.1159/000485830 PMCID: PMC5803721 [Available on 2018-12-01]PMID: 29456469
