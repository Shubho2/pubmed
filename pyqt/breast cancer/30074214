We previouslyreported that LPS promoted metastasis of mesenchymallike breast cancer cells withhigh expression of cyclin D1b. However, the role of cyclin D1b in LPS-induced EMThas not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we described that cyclin D1baugmented EMT induced by LPS in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Cyclin D1b markedlyamplified integrin αvβ3 expression, which was further up-regulated under LPSstimulation. Our results showed ectopic expression of cyclin D1b promotedinvasiveness of epithelial-like MCF-7 cells under LPS stimulation. Additionally, LPS-induced metastasis and EMT in MCF-7-D1b cells might depend on αvβ3expression. Further exploration indicated that cyclin D1b cooperated with HoxD3, a transcription factor promoting αvβ3 expression, to promote LPSinduced EMT.Knockout of HoxD3 repressed LPS-induced EMT and αvβ3 over-expression in MCF-7cells with high expression of cyclin D1b. Specifically, all these effects were ina cyclin Dla independent manner. Taken all together, LPS up-regulated integrinαvβ3 expression in MCF-7 cells with high expression of cyclin D1b and induced EMTin breast cancer cells, which highlights that cyclin D1b may act as an endogenouspathway participating in exogenous signal inducing EMT in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1007/s11596-018-1902-5 PMID: 30074214
