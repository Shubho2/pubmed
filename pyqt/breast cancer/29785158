Our objective is to compare the twomethods with the histopathological results for a preset cut off and asses whichparameters can influence the positive margin status.Method: A prospective study was performed on 83 patients who underwent breastconservation surgery for early breast cancer (pT1-3a pN0-1 M0) between 2014 and2016. After excision the specimen was oriented in the operating room by thesurgeon. Metallic clips and threads were placed on margins: one clip and the longthread at 12 o'clock, two clips and the short threads at 9 o'clock. The next stepwas intraoperative ultrasound assessment of the specimen. For the margins under 2mm we performed selective margin shaving, followed by mammography to identify anddocument the lesion and finally histopathological examination of the specimenwith reporting the gross and microscopic margins. The positive margins requiredre-excision or boost of radiation at the posterior or anterior margins, dependingon the case.Results: We set a cut-off at 2 mm. The sensitivity and specificity of theintraoperative margin assessment via the ultrasound method were 90.91% (95% CI70.84-98.88%) and 67.21% (95% CI 54-78.69%) respectively. The sensitivity andspecificity of the intraoperative margin assessment via the mammographicprocedure were 45.45% (95% CI 24.39-67.79%) and 85.25% (95% CI 73.83-93.02%)respectively. There was positive correlation between the histopathological andintraoperative ultrasound exam (p=0.018) and negative correlation between thehistopathological exam and the post-operative mammographic exam (p=0.68). Wefound a positive correlation between the positive margin status and age (<40),preoperative chemotherapy, intraductal carcinoma, inflammatory process around thetumor, and the immunohistochemical triple negative profile.Conclusions: According to our results, the intraoperative ultrasound of thebreast specimen for a cutt-off at 2 mm can decrease the rates of marginpositivity compared to the mammographic procedure and has the potential todiminish the number of subsequent undesired re-excisions.DOI: 10.15386/cjmed-891 PMCID: PMC5958985PMID: 29785158
