[Epub aheadof print]Postmenopausal Osteoporosis: A Clinical Review.Watts NB(1).Author information: (1)Mercy Health Osteoporosis and Bone Health Services , Cincinnati, Ohio.In postmenopausal women, osteoporotic fractures are more common than stroke,myocardial infarction, and breast cancer combined, and fractures can be costlyand result in disability or death. Because there are no signs or symptoms ofosteoporosis other than fracture, risk assessment is necessary to identify those at higher risk for clinical events. For women, a clinical fracture riskassessment (FRAX) is appropriate at menopause. Bone mineral density (BMD)measurement is recommended for women at age 65, and earlier for those who haverisk factors. Adequate calcium, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise areimportant for bone health at all ages, and those at high risk for fracture based on BMD or FRAX should be offered medical therapy to reduce fracture risk after anappropriate medical evaluation. Bisphosphonates can accumulate in bone, so after a period of treatment, lower risk patients may be offered a period off drugtherapy. However, the effects of denosumab are not sustained when treatment isdiscontinued, so there is no "drug holiday" with denosumab. Anabolic therapy can be offered to those with higher risk for fracture. Although rare safety concerns regarding atypical femoral fracture and osteonecrosis of the jaw have receivedprominent attention, for patients who are appropriately treated according toNational Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines, the benefit of hip fracture riskreduction far outweighs the risk of these uncommon side effects. Accurateinformation for patients and shared decision-making are important for acceptance and persistent with appropriate treatment.DOI: 10.1089/jwh.2017.6706 PMID: 29583083
