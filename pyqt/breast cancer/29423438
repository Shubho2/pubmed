This study included 11,478 women (45-69 years; 36% premenopausal) participating in an ongoingnational cancer screening program in 11 urban provinces in China and predicted ashaving high-risk for breast cancer. Polytomous logistic regression was performed to assess associations between MD and risk factors by comparing each higherBreast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category (2, 3, or 4) to thelowest category (BI-RADS, 1). We found associations of increasing age, body mass index, weight, postmenopausal status, and parity with lower MD. Higher levels of education, increasing height, and later first birth were associated with higherMD. These associations did not vary by menopausal status. Additionally, theassociation between longer period of breastfeeding and lower MD was seen amongpostmenopausal women only (Pinteraction = 0.003). Having first-degree relativeswith breast cancer diagnosed before 50 years was associated with lower MD onlyamong premenopausal women (Pinteraction = 0.061). We found effects of establishedbreast cancer risk factors on MD showed similar directions in Chinese and Westernwomen, supporting the hypothesis that MD represents cumulative exposure to breastcancer risk factors over the life course. Our findings help to understand thebiological basis of the association of MD with breast cancer risk and haveimplications for breast cancer prevention research in China.DOI: 10.1038/s41523-018-0055-9 PMCID: PMC5802809PMID: 29423438
