The cancer incidence rate was calculated in strata by cancer type, sex, age group and area. The population composition of China in 1982 and Segi'spopulation structure were used to calculate age-standardized rates. Extensiveprocedures were used to assure the quality of the data.Results: The overall data quality indicators of the percentage of morphologyverification (MV) (%), the percentage of death certificate-only (DCO) (%) and themortality to incidence ratio (M/I) were 72.15%, 0.94% and 0.54 respectively. Atotal of 45,300 new cancer cases were diagnosed in Beijing in 2014. The incidencerate was 341.92/100,000 (343.50/100,000 in males, 340.33/100,000 in females), andthe age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) andby world standard population (ASIRW) were 143.48/100,000 and 182.99/100,000,respectively. The cumulative incidence rate for cancer before 75 years was20.61%. Cancers of lung, colorectum, liver, stomach and prostate were the topfive common cancer types for males, while cancers of breast, lung, thyroid,colorectum and uterus were the top five common cancer types for females. Thedifferent patterns were also observed between rural and urban areas. Regardingtemporal trends, the incidence of thyroid cancer has the fastest growth between2005 and 2014. The incidence of liver cancer decreased, and stomach andesophageal cancer also decreased significantly for males in the last decade.Incidence rate for lung cancer was relatively stable during that period of time.Conclusions: With more than 45,000 new cases in Beijing in 2014, cancer remainsan important public health problem. Actions should be taken to diminish totalcancer incidence in Beijing.DOI: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.01.02 PMCID: PMC5842227PMID: 29545715
