Electronicaddress: peppi.koivunen@oulu.fi.Histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) are 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases(2-OGDDs) that regulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure. Theirdysregulation has been associated with many cancers. We set out to study thecatalytic and inhibitory properties of human KDM4A, KDM4B, KDM5B, KDM6A andKDM6B, aiming in particular to reveal which of these enzymes are targeted bycancer-associated 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) analogues. We used affinity-purifiedinsect cell-produced enzymes and synthetic peptides with trimethylated lysines assubstrates for the in vitro enzyme activity assays. In addition, we treatedbreast cancer cell lines with cell-permeable forms of 2-OG analogues and studied their effects on the global histone methylation state. Our data show that KDMshave substrate specificity. Among the enzymes studied, KDM5B had the highestaffinity for the peptide substrate but the lowest affinity for the 2-OG and theFe2+ cosubstrate/cofactors. R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG) was the most efficientinhibitor of KDM6A, KDM4A and KDM4B, followed by S-2HG. This finding wassupported by accumulations of the histone H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks in cellstreated with the cell-permeable forms of these compounds. KDM5B was especiallyresistant to inhibition by R-2HG, while citrate was the most efficient inhibitor of KDM6B. We conclude that KDM catalytic activity is susceptible to inhibition bytumorigenic 2-OG analogues and suggest that the inhibition of KDMs is involved inthe disease mechanism of cancers in which these compounds accumulate, such as theisocitrate dehydrogenase mutations.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
