Histological results and follow-up at one year were usedas reference standard for sensitivity. Main outcome measures were cancerdetection rate, sensitivity, recall rate, biopsy rate, and positive predictivevalue of biopsy for combined screening with mammography plus ultrasound versusmammography alone.RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of mammography only was 61.5% in women withdense breasts and 86.6% in women with non-dense breasts. The sensitivity ofmammography plus ultrasound combined was 81.3% in women with dense breasts and95.0% in women with non-dense breasts. Adjunctive ultrasound increased the recallrate from 10.5 to 16.5 per 1000 women screened, and increased the biopsy ratefrom 6.3 to 9.3 per 1000 women screened. The positive predictive value of biopsy was 55.5% (95% CI 50.6%-60.3%) for mammography alone and 43.3 (95% CI39.4%-47.3%) for combined mammography plus ultrasound.CONCLUSIONS: Supplemental ultrasound improves cancer detection in screening ofwomen at average risk for breast cancer. Recall rates and biopsy rates can bekept within acceptable limits.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejrad.2018.01.022 PMID: 29571797
