It isgenerally assumed that to be effective, these cell lines need to expressimmunogenic antigens coexpressed in patient tumor cells, and antigen-presentingcells need to take up such antigens then present them to patient T cells. We havepreviously reported that, in a phase I pilot study (ClinicalTrials.govNCT00095862), a subject with stage IV breast cancer experienced substantialregression of breast, lung, and brain lesions following inoculation with clinicalformulations of SV-BR-1-GM, a GM-CSF-secreting breast tumor cell line. Toidentify diagnostic features permitting the prospective identification ofpatients likely to benefit from SV-BR-1-GM, we conducted a molecular analysis of the SV-BR-1-GM cell line and of patient-derived blood, as well as a tumorspecimen. Compared to normal human breast cells, SV-BR-1-GM cells overexpressgenes encoding tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) such as PRAME, a cancer/testisantigen. Curiously, despite its presumptive breast epithelial origin, the cellline expresses major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes (HLA-DRA,HLA-DRB3, HLA-DMA, HLA-DMB), in addition to several other factors known to playimmunostimulatory roles. These factors include MHC class I components (B2M,HLA-A, HLA-B), ADA (encoding adenosine deaminase), ADGRE5 (CD97), CD58 (LFA3),CD74 (encoding invariant chain and CLIP), CD83, CXCL8 (IL8), CXCL16, HLA-F, IL6, IL18, and KITLG. Moreover, both SV-BR-1-GM cells and the responding study subjectcarried an HLA-DRB3*02:02 allele, raising the question of whether SV-BR-1-GMcells can directly present endogenous antigens to T cells, thereby inducing atumor-directed immune response. In support of this, SV-BR-1-GM cells (which also carry the HLA-DRB3*01:01 allele) treated with yellow fever virus (YFV) envelope(Env) 43-59 peptides reactivated YFV-DRB3*01:01-specific CD4+ T cells. Thus, the partial HLA allele match between SV-BR-1-GM and the clinical responder might haveenabled patient T lymphocytes to directly recognize SV-BR-1-GM TAAs as presented on SV-BR-1-GM MHCs. Taken together, our findings are consistent with apotentially unique mechanism of action by which SV-BR-1-GM cells can act as APCs for previously primed CD4+ T cells.DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00776 PMCID: PMC5962696PMID: 29867922
