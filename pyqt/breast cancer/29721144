The aim of this study was to determine a descriptive profile of 80 womenand establish a description of risk factors associated with breast cancer inthese women.Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited women with breast cancer inOuagadougou. Teaching Hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo in Burkina Faso from January2015 to February 2016. We have collected data on socio-demographiccharacteristics, reproductive status, clinical information, treatment andmolecular characteristics.Results: The average age of the study population was 48.2±12.4 years. Familyhistory of breast cancer was reported in 18.75% of the studied participantsagainst 16.25% family history for other types of cancer. Patients from urbanareas represented 87.5% of our studied population with 58.75% of household,multiparous (55.0%), no aborts status (56.2%), post-menopausal women (53.75%), nooral contraception (63.75%), regular menstrual cycle (71.25%) and the prevalence of obesity was 12.5%. The clinical and molecular characteristics showed thatleft-sided breast cancer accounted for 51.25 %, high grade (II and III)represented 93.75 % of cases and the majority of tumors were infiltrating ductal carcinomas (93.75%) with stages III and IV accounted for 50.0%.Conclusion: This study described the distribution of risks factors in apopulation of breast cancer women. Although more research are needed to supportthese findings, a clear understanding of risk factors associated with breastcancer would contribute to significantly reduce breast cancer incidence andmortality in Burkina Faso.DOI: 10.11604/pamj.2017.28.314.10203 PMCID: PMC5927573PMID: 29721144  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
