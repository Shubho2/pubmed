If these measurements weresufficiently accurate and repeatable, they could be used in planning oncological breast surgery and as an objective measure of aesthetic outcome. The aim of this study was to validate the measurements of breast volume and symmetry provided by the Vectra XT imaging system.METHODS: To validate measurements, breast phantom models of true volume between100 and 1000 cm3 were constructed and varying amounts removed to mimic breasttissue 'resections'. The volumes of the phantoms were measured using 3D-SI by twoobservers and compared to a gold standard. For intra-observer repeatability andinter-observer reproducibility in vivo, 16 patients who had undergone oncologicalbreast surgery had breast volume and symmetry measured three times by twoobservers.RESULTS: A mean relative difference of 2.17 and 2.28% for observer 1 and 2respectively was seen in the phantom measurements compared to the gold standard(n = 45, Bland Altman agreement). Intra-observer variation over ten repeatedmeasurements demonstrated mean coefficients of variation (CV) of 0.58 and 0.49%, respectively. The inter-observer variation demonstrated a mean relativedifference of 0.11% between the two observers. In patients, intra-observervariation over three repeated volume measurements for each observer was 3.9 and3.8% (mean CV); the mean relative difference between observers was 5.78%. Forthree repeated shape symmetry measurements using RMS projection differencebetween the two breasts, the intra-observer variations were 8 and 14% (mean CV), the mean relative difference between observers was 0.43 mm for average symmetryvalues that ranged from about 3.5 to 15.5 mm.CONCLUSION: This first validation of breast volume and shape symmetrymeasurements using the Vectra XT 3D-SI system suggests that these measurementshave the potential to assist in pre-operative planning and also as a measure ofaesthetic outcome.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4843-6 PMID: 29872939
