While increased expression of humanendogenous retrovirus (HERV) elements has already been linked to unfavorableprognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and ovarian carcinoma yetless is known about the impact of the expression of different HERV elements onsarcomagenesis in general as well as the outcome of soft tissue sarcoma (STS)patients. Therefore, in this study the association between expression of HERV-Kand HERV-F and the clinicopathological characteristics in a cohort of STSs aswell as the patients' prognosis was evaluated. HERV-K and HERV-F expression wasassessed by quantitative real-time PCR in 120 patient specimens. HERV-K andHERV-F expression was significantly correlated (rS = 0.5; p = 6.4 × 10-9;Spearman's rank bivariate correlation). Also, tumor diameter exhibited asignificant negative association to HERV-K and HERV-F expression. Levels ofseveral hypoxia-related RNAs like HIF-1α and miR-210 showed a significantpositive correlation with both HERV-K and HERV-F expression. Although in survivalanalyses no impact of HERV expression on disease-specific survival could bedetected, patients with elevated HERV-K expression had a significantly shorterrelapse-free survival (p = 0.014, log-rank analysis). In conclusion, we provideevidence for the first time that the increased expression of HERV-K in tumors is associated with STS patients' prognosis.DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.00211 PMCID: PMC5816752PMID: 29487589
