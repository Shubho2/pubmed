However, the potential molecularmechanisms of breast cancer are still unclear. With the development of sequencingtechnology, we discovered that LINC00673 is upregulated in tumor tissues. But themain role of LINC00673 in breast cancer has yet to be confirmed.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 35 pairs of breast tumors and normal tissues were selectedto real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to validateLINC00673 is overexpressed in tumor tissues. We conducted proliferation, colonyformation, migration, invasion assays, and EMT-related phenotype to determine thespecific role of LINC00673 in breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, andMCF-7) transfected with small interfering RNA. Gene expression profiling wasconducted to found LINC00673-associated gene transcriptional changes.RESULTS: We discovered that LINC00673 is significantly upregulated in breastcancer tissues compared to paired adjacent non-tumor tissues by RT-qPCR andhighly expressed LINC00673 is positively correlated with lymph node metastasisand clinical stage in the validated cohort. Knocking down LINC00673 inhibitedcell proliferation and metastasis, whereas upregulated LINC00673 had the oppositeeffect. Gene expression profiling results indicated that LINC00673 couldinfluence NCR3LG1(B7-H6) expression in transcriptional level. Western Blot showedus that LINC00673 could regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) andB7-H6 in protein level. Then we demonstrated that knocking down B7-H6 coulddecrease breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis.CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified the role of LINC00673 in inducingproliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cell lines and it might act as anunderlying therapeutic target for breast cancer.PMID: 30094100
