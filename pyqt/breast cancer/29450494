This analysis was performed as a preplanned secondary study of data from the Anastrozole or Tamoxifen Alone or Combined randomized clinical trialcomparing 5-year treatment with anastrozole vs tamoxifen with 10-year follow-updata. The signatures included the Oncotype Dx recurrence score, PAM50-basedProsigna risk of recurrence (ROR), Breast Cancer Index (BCI), EndoPredict(EPclin), Clinical Treatment Score, and 4-marker immunohistochemical score. Data were collected from January 2009, through April 2015.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary objective was to compare the prognosticvalue of these signatures in addition to the Clinical Treatment Score (nodalstatus, tumor size, grade, age, and endocrine treatment) for distant recurrencefor 0 to 10 years and 5 to 10 years after diagnosis. Likelihood ratio (LR)statistics were used with the χ2 test and C indexes to assess the prognosticvalue of each signature.Results: In this study of 774 postmenopausal women with ER-positive,ERBB2-negative disease (mean [SD] age, 64.1 [8.1] years), 591 (mean [SD] age,63.4 [7.9] years) had node-negative disease. The signatures providing the mostprognostic information were the ROR (hazard ratio [HR], 2.56; 95% CI, 1.96-3.35),followed by the BCI (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.88-3.23) and EPclin (HR, 2.14; 95% CI,1.71-2.68). Each provided significantly more information than the ClinicalTreatment Score (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.58-2.50), the recurrence score (HR, 1.69;95% CI, 1.40-2.03), and the 4-marker immunohistochemical score (HR, 1.95; 95% CI,1.55-2.45). Substantially less information was provided by all 6 molecular tests for the 183 patients with 1 to 3 positive nodes, but the BCI (ΔLR χ2 = 9.2) andEPclin (ΔLR χ2 = 7.4) provided more additional prognostic information than theother signatures.Conclusions and Relevance: For women with node-negative disease, the ROR, BCI,and EPclin were significantly more prognostic for overall and late distantrecurrence. For women with 1 to 3 positive nodes, limited independent informationwas available from any test. These data might help oncologists and patients tochoose the most appropriate test when considering chemotherapy use and/orextended endocrine therapy.Trial Registration: isrctn.com Identifier: ISRCTN18233230.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.5524 PMCID: PMC5885222PMID: 29450494
