China.(2)Department of Pharmacy, Dongying People's Hospital, Dongying, Shandong 257091,P.R. China.The expression of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), breast cancer susceptibilitygene 1 (BRCA1) and P62 in ovarian cancer was investigated to explore itsassociation with chemotherapy sensitivity in ovarian cancer patients. Tumortissues and para-carcinoma normal tissues of 60 ovarian cancer patientshospitalized in Department of Surgery in Dongying Hospital from June, 2012 toJune, 2015 were collected. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chainreaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the mRNA expression levels of HMGB1, BRCA1 and P62 in tumor and para-carcinoma normal tissues. Moreover,immunohistochemistry was used to detect the protein expression of HMGB1, BRCA1and P62 in tumor tissues and para-carcinoma normal tissues. The cancer tissuespecimens were divided into the chemotherapy resistance group and sensitivitygroup through the in vitro resin droplet experiment to analyze the association ofthe expression of HMGB1, BRCA1 and P62 in epithelial ovarian cancer withchemotherapy resistance of patients. The RT-qPCR results showed that theexpression of HMGB1, BRCA1 and P62 in ovarian cancer tissues at the mRNA levelwas significantly higher than that in para-carcinoma normal tissues.Immunohistochemical results showed that the positive expression levels of HMGB1, BRCA1 and P62 in ovarian carcinoma tissue were 61.67% (37/60), 76.33% (47/60) and71.67% (43/60), respectively, while the positive expression levels of HMGB1,BRCA1 and P62 in para-carcinoma normal tissues were 13.33% (8/60), 8.33% (5/60)and 11.67% (7/60), respectively, and the differences were statisticallysignificant (P<0.05). In vitro resin droplet experiment revealed that 38 out of60 ovarian cancer patients were drug resistant and 22 patients were sensitive to the therapy. The analysis of the association with chemotherapy sensitivityrevealed that the positive expression of HMGB1, BRCA1 and P62 was associated withthe drug resistance of ovarian cancer patients. The positive expression of HMGB1,BRCA1 and P62 was associated with chemotherapy sensitivity of ovarian cancerpatients. Therefore, HMGB1, BRCA1 and P62 may be molecular markers for theprediction of chemotherapy sensitivity of ovarian cancer patients.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8482 PMCID: PMC5958823PMID: 29844838
