Theacquisition of anoikis resistance, a programmed cell death process triggered bysubstratum detachment, is an important mechanism in TNBC metastasis. Therefore,agents that can restore the sensitivity of cancer cells to anoikis may be helpfulfor the treatment of metastatic TNBC. In this study, we investigated theinhibitory effect of Tubeimosides V (TBMS-V), a cyclic bisdesmoside isolated fromthe ethanol extracts of tubers of B. paniculatum., on anoikis resistance and the involvement of caveolin-1(CAV-1)-related signaling pathways in such process inMDA-MB-231 cells. The results showed that the treatment of TBMS-V could sensitizecancer cells to anoikis, which was associated with suppression ofanchorage-independent culture-induced CAV-1 overexpression, EGFR activation aswell as ITGB1-FAK activation. The data from this study might contribute toproviding a potential therapeutic target for metastatic TNBC and suggest thepossibility of TBMS-V and its derivatives for metastatic TNBC therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
