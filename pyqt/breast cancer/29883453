Adult cancer patients receivingradiotherapy at a Japanese hospital were invited to complete a touchscreen tabletsurvey. Patient survey responses were linked and comparisons made with a surveycompleted by their radiation oncologist. Among 146 cancer patient-oncologistdyads, there was almost perfect agreement on cancer diagnosis (ĸ = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.82-0.94), substantial agreement on time since diagnosis (ĸ = 0.70, 95% CI:0.57-0.83) and moderate agreement on whether treatment goal was curative orpalliative (ĸ = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.28-0.57; all p's < 0.0001). Agreement aboutwhether a life expectancy discussion had occurred was less than expected bychance (κ = -0.06, p = 0.9). Radiation oncologists reported that they had spoken to over two thirds of patients about this, whilst less than one third of patientsstated that this discussion had occurred with their radiation oncologist. Overhalf of the patients who had not discussed life expectancy wanted to. Patientshad variable preferences for whether they (80%), their radiation oncologist (78%)or their partner/family (52%) should decide whether they discuss their lifeexpectancy. Although patient self-reported information about diagnosis and timesince diagnosis appears to be reasonably accurate (compared withclinician-reported information), limitations of self-reported data aboutprognostic discussions were highlighted by poor agreement between patient- andclinician-reported information about whether prognostic discussions haveoccurred. Additional support is needed to improve prognosis communication andunderstanding in radiation oncology settings.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198437 PMCID: PMC5993258PMID: 29883453
