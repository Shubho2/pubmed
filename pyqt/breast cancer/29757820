Frequent modifications and earlier lack of agreement about recommendations created confusion. The purpose of this study was to explore towhat extent advanced practice nurses (APNs) adopted cervical cancer screeningguidelines.METHODS: A longitudinal survey of 358 APNs conducted in three New England states regarding cervical cancer screening practices in 2008, 2012, and 2015.CONCLUSIONS: Advanced practice nurses are incorporating guidelines at a highrate. Advanced practice nurses found it easier to incorporate guidelines to delayscreening until the age of 21 years, to discontinue screening after totalhysterectomy for benign reasons, and to discontinue screening at the age of 65years. In 2012, 15% of APNs were screening women aged 21-29 years every 3 years; by 2015, this rate rose to 72%. By 2015, half of APNs were screening low-riskwomen aged 30-64 every 5 years. Because screening practices changed, APNsquestioned the need to perform screening pelvic and breast examinations. Advancedpractice nurses no longer perform screening pelvic examinations (93%) or breastexaminations (75%) in adolescents.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Some APNs indicated that office-based practicestandards are barriers to adherence to guidelines. Advanced practice nurses need to be involved in practice committees to ensure that evidence guides practicedecisions.DOI: 10.1097/JXX.0000000000000003 PMID: 29757820
