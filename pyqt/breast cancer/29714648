Casesdiagnosed in stage IV or that progress in metastatic phase represent a specificand challenging task for oncologists. Estimates on the burden of breast cancer(BC) in stage IV in Italy are not available.METHODS: We applied mortality-incidence age-specific ratios measured in theUnited States in 2013 for BC in stage IV at diagnosis (de novo) or following aprevious diagnosis in a localized stage (distant recurrence) to the age-specific BC deaths observed in Italy in 2014. The US mortality-prevalence age-specificratios were used for estimating de novo and distant recurrence prevalentmetastatic BC.RESULTS: In 2014 in Italy, there were 12,330 deaths due to BC. We estimated that in the same year about 3400 BC were newly diagnosed in stage IV (7.1% of all the new cases); moreover, more than 10,000 other BC progressed to stage IV. Inaddition, in 2014, the overall number of BC in stage IV, whenever diagnosed, was about 37,100 (5.6% of all the estimated prevalent BC).CONCLUSIONS: These estimates quantify, for the first time in Italy, the burden ofBC in stage IV, at diagnosis or during the clinical course, providing usefulfigures for clinicians and policy makers.DOI: 10.1177/0300891618766177 PMID: 29714648  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
