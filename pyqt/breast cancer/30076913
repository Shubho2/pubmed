In this present study, a flavonoid, fisetin, which can befound in diverse foods, is investigated for its ability to inhibit cell motility,and the underlying mechanism is also studied in breast cancer cells (4T1 and JCcells). We have revealed that fisetin increased HO-1 mRNA and proteinexpressions. Besides, fisetin also elevated Nrf2 expression in nuclear fraction. By silencing Nrf2, fisetin-induced HO-1 expression was abrogated, suggested that HO-1 expression was mediated by up-regulation of the transcription factor Nrf2.In addition, we also found that fisetin decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzyme activityand gene expression in both protein and mRNA levels. Moreover, by administration of HO-1 inhibitors, tin protoporphyrin and zinc protoporphyrin, fisetin-reducedMMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions were reversed. Furthermore, transfection of siRNAagainst HO-1 and Nrf2 also abolished MMP-2 and MMP-9 reduction exerted byfisetin. These findings suggest that fisetin-mediated MMP-2 and MMP-9 reductionis regulated by HO-1 through Nrf2. Therefore, fisetin may be useful as apotential therapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
