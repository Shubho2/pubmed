Possiblesystemic toxicity and the rapid biodegradation of drug carriers are potentialrisks in the use of carriers for drug-delivery formulations. Therefore, thecarrier-free drug delivery of an anti-cancer drug is desirable. Herein,4-amino-2-benzyl-6-methylpyrimidine (ABMP) was synthesized via a new method usinga sodium catalyst, and proved to be effective in inducing breast cancer cell(MDA-MB-231) apoptosis. Moreover, the transparent amorphous state solid of ABMPwas demonstrated to have a slow-release property in phosphate buffer solution(PBS). Microspheres of ABMP were prepared with diameters in the range of 5-15 Î¼m.The slow-release property of the ABMP microspheres indicated their potential use for controlled-release drug delivery. We believe that microspheres of ABMP havepotential as a new kind of carrier-free anti-cancer drug delivery system.DOI: 10.3390/ma11020281 PMCID: PMC5848978PMID: 29439458
