Little is understood about hownotifications are perceived by recipients. This qualitative study sought tounderstand how dense breast notifications (DBNs) impact women's perceptions andtheir participation in follow-up care.METHODS: We assessed rates of DBN recall and conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 30 English-speaking women ages 40 to 74 after receiving a DBNfrom a Massachusetts hospital. Content coding characterized women's recall of thenotification content, perceptions of breast density, and planned or actualparticipation in follow-up care.RESULTS: Most women (81%) recalled receiving a DBN, but few could recall specificcontent. Women described struggling to understand the meaning of breast densityand created their own explanatory models of dense breasts that differed frommedical explanations. Many women planned to or did talk with their doctors about breast density as a result of receiving the notification.CONCLUSIONS: Women receiving DBNs have limited knowledge and many misperceptions about the implications of having dense breasts.PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Educational support is needed to promote informeddecision- making about breast cancer screening that incorporates personal risk inthe setting of dense breast legislation.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
