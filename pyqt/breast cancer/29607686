NO users were identified through naturopathic doctors' clinics and usual care (UC) controls with similar prognosis were identified through a cancer registry. The registry provided information about all participants' age, race,ethnicity, marital status, stage of cancer at time of diagnosis, date ofdiagnosis, and use of conventional medical treatments (surgery, chemotherapy,radiation, and endocrine therapy). Data of participants' self-reportedinvolvement in decision-making and HRQOL were collected at study enrollment andat 6-month follow-up.RESULTS: At 6-month follow-up, the NO patients reported significantly moreinvolvement in decision-making about care and better general health than did UCpatients ( P < .05). Self-reported involvement in decision-making about cancertreatment was associated with better role-physical, role-emotional, andsocial-functional well-being ( P < .05). Race, age, marital status, andcongruence of preferred and achieved levels of involvement also predicted aspectsof HRQOL in breast cancer survivors ( P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Both NO CAM care and involvement in decision-making about cancertreatment may be associated with better HRQOL in breast cancer survivors.DOI: 10.1177/1534735418762543 PMID: 29607686
