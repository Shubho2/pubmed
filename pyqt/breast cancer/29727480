Participants completed outcome assessments at baseline and 1, 3,and 6 months after the last writing session.RESULTS: Surprisingly, results indicated that there was generally a smallincrease in PTSS (ESsg = .16) and a small decrease in PTG (ESsg = -.16) frombaseline to the 6-month follow-up. Effect size comparisons and latent growthcurve models also indicated that the cancer facts condition was generallyassociated with superior outcomes for both PTSS and PTG.CONCLUSIONS: These findings speak to the importance of examining whetherinterventions are equally efficacious in different cultures.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jclp.22636 PMID: 29727480
