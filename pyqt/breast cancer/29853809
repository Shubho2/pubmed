This study aimed to evaluate the application of a single chain variable fragment (scFv) of anti-VCAM-1 antibody labeled with 99mTc as a possible imaging agent in several tumors. VCAM-1 scFv was labeled with 99mTc using succinimidyl6-hydrazinium nicotinate hydrochloride, and 99mTc-HYNIC-VCAM-1scFv wassuccessfully synthesized with a high radiolabeling yield. VCAM-1 expression wasevaluated in six cell lines by immunofluorescence staining. In vitro bindingassays showed different binding affinities of 99mTc-HYNIC-VCAM-1scFv in differenttumor cell lines, with high uptake in B16F10 melanoma and HT1080 fibrosarcomacells, which was consistent with immunofluorescence staining results. In vivoSPECT planar imaging demonstrated that B16F10 and HT1080 tumors could be clearly visualized. Less intense uptake was observed in human SKOV3.ip ovarian tumor, andweak uptake was observed in human A375m melanoma, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, and786-O renal tumors. These findings were confirmed by biodistribution andimmunofluorescence studies. High uptake by B16F10 tumors was inhibited by excess unlabeled VCAM-1scFv. 99mTc-HYNIC-VCAM-1scFv, which selectively binds to VCAM-1, can provide a qualitative and semiquantitative method for noninvasive evaluation of VCAM-1 expression by tumors.DOI: 10.1155/2018/7832805 PMCID: PMC5960529PMID: 29853809
