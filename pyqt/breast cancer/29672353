We evaluated the impact of BMI and height on the risk of endometrial cancer, overall and byhistological subtype. We prospectively investigated 53 651 Japanese women aged40-69 years. With an average follow-up duration of 18.6 years, 180 newlydiagnosed endometrial cancers were reported, including 119 type 1 and 21 type 2. The association between BMI, height, and endometrial cancer risk was assessedusing a Cox proportional hazards regression model with adjustment for potentialconfounders. Overweight and obesity were associated positively with the risk ofendometrial cancer. Compared with BMI of 23.0-24.9 kg/m, hazard ratios (HRs) (95%confidence intervals) were 1.93 (1.17-3.16) for BMI of 27.0-29.9 kg/m and 2.37(1.20-4.66) for BMI of at least 30.0 kg/m. On analysis by histological subtype,with each increase in BMI of 5 U, the estimated HR of type 1 endometrial cancerincreased (HR=1.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.21-1.98), but HR of type 2endometrial cancer was unaffected. There was no statistically significantassociation between height and endometrial cancer risk. In conclusion, the riskof endometrial cancer was elevated in women with a BMI of at least 27.0 kg/m. By histological subtype, BMI was associated with type 1, but not type 2 endometrial cancer risk among a population with a relatively low BMI compared with westernpopulations.DOI: 10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000449 PMID: 29672353
