[Epubahead of print]Association Between Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-2α (HIF-2α) Expression andColorectal Cancer and Its Prognostic Role: a Systematic Analysis.Han S(1), Huang T(2), Li W(1), Liu S(1), Yang W(1), Shi Q(1), Li H(1), Ren J(1), Hou F(1).Author information: (1)Shanghai Municipal Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, ShanghaiUniversity of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.(2)The Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, Ningbo, China.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although some studies showed that HIF-2α expression wascorrelated with an unfavorable prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC), theprognostic results remain conflicting in CRC. The present study was performed to evaluate the association between HIF-2α expression and the clinicopathologicalfeatures of this disease and to examine the potential prognostic role of HIF-2αexpression in CRC.METHODS: Pooled odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated fromavailable publications, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene ExpressionOmnibus (GEO) datasets. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was used to estimate the required sample information.RESULTS: HIF-2α protein expression was more frequent in CRC than in normalcolonic tissues (OR = 150.49, P < 0.001), higher in male than female CRC patients(OR = 1.47, P = 0.008), and lower in high-grade than low-grade CRC (OR = 0.49, P = 0.029). TSA verified the reliability of the above results. HIF-2α expressionwas not linked to the prognosis of CRC in overall survival (OS), disease-specificsurvival (DSS), metastasis-free survival, and relapse-free survival, and nosignificant correlation was found between HIF-2α alteration and OS ordisease-free survival (DFS) of CRC. Expression of both HIF-2α and vascularendothelial growth factor (VEGFA, VEGFB, or VEGFC) was associated with a poormetastasis-free survival of CRC (HR = 6.95, HR = 113.51, and HR = 8.11,respectively). No association was observed between HIF-2α expression and DFS inother cancers, but HIF-2α expression was correlated with a worse DFS of CRC (HR =1.23, P = 0.037). Moreover, HIF-2α expression was linked to a good survivalbenefit in some cancers (B-cell lymphoma and lung adenocarcinoma: OS, multiplemyeloma: DSS, breast cancer: distant metastasis-free survival, liposarcoma:distant recurrence-free survival) (all HRs < 1, Ps < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: HIF-2α expression may be associated with the carcinogenesis of CRC, which is higher in males than in females, negatively linked to tumordifferentiation, and correlated with a worse DFS of CRC. Additional prospectivestudies are needed.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.DOI: 10.1159/000491806 PMID: 30021192
