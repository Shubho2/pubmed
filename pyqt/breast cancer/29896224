Cancer stem cells represent anovel approach to target cancer and reduce cancer recurrence and metastasis. Manypatients with breast cancer continue to smoke after receiving their diagnosis.Nicotine is a key factor in tobacco addiction and also changes some cellularfunctions, such as activation of mitogenic pathways, angiogenesis and cellproliferation. In the present study, the impact of nicotine was assessed in apopulation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Cluster of differentiation(CD)44+CD24- cancer stem cell population of MCF-7 cells were evaluated using flowcytometry and scanning electron microscopy. Chemoresistance effects of nicotinewere demonstrated in these cells. These findings demonstrated harmful effects of nicotine following metastasis of cancer, owing to the chemoresistance producedthrough uninterrupted smoking, which may impact the effectiveness of treatment.DOI: 10.3892/etm.2018.6149 PMCID: PMC5995074PMID: 29896224
