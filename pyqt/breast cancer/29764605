The present study sought to understand how stressfulness appraisal ofsalient Life Events (LEs) influences breast cancer risk.METHODS: A case-control design was used and included 664 female cases identified through the Cancer Surveillance Program of Orange County, CA and 203 femalepopulation-based controls. A LE questionnaire determined if events occurred priorto breast cancer diagnosis and if these events were considered to be stressful ornot. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate ORswhile adjusting for known breast cancer covariates.RESULTS: Cumulative adverse LEs perceived as stressful were associated withincreased breast cancer risk in a dose response fashion (OR = 1.63, 95%CI = 1.00-2.66, Ptrend = 0.045). Conversely, events perceived as non-stressfuldid not have a significant impact on breast cancer risk. Previous personalillness was directly related to increased breast cancer risk, whether perceivedas stressful (OR = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.96-4.11) or non-stressful (OR = 3.47, 95%CI = 1.34-8.94). Abortion and relocation were observed to have a protectiveeffect on breast cancer risk only when reported as stressful (OR = 0.54, 95%CI = 0.32-0.92; OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.43-0.93, respectively). Pre/Peri-menopausalwomen who were nulliparous or who had their first child at ≥30 years of age were especially prone to the effects of appraised stress on increased breast cancerrisk.CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the importance of stressfulness appraisalwhen determining the effect of major LEs on breast cancer risk. Our resultssupport incorporating assessments of perceived stressfulness in futureepidemiological investigation of this topic.Copyright © 2018.
