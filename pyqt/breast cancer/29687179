We sought to compare the CST and SST for BM with respect tooperative times and complications.METHODS: Patients undergoing BM without reconstruction at our institution between2005 and 2015 were identified using operative caselogs and stratified into CS-and SS-cohorts. Operative time (OT; incision to closure) was calculated. Patient age, cancer presence/stage, hormone receptor/BRCA status, breast weight, axillaryprocedure, and 30-day complications were extracted. Differences in OT,complications, and demographics between cohorts were assessed with t tests andChi-square tests. A multivariate linear regression model was fit to identifyfactors independently associated with OT.RESULTS: Overall, 109 BM cases were identified (CS, n = 58 [53.2%]; SS, n = 51[46.8%]). Average duration was significantly shorter for the CST by 33 min (21.6%reduction; CS: 120 min vs. SS: 153 min, p < 0.001), with no difference incomplication rates (p = 0.65). Demographic characteristics did not differ betweencohorts except for total breast weight (TBW) (CS: 1878 g vs. SS: 1452 g,p < 0.05). Adjusting for TBW, CST resulted in a 27.8% reduction in OT (44-minsavings, p < 0.001) compared to SST.CONCLUSIONS: The CST significantly reduces OT for BM procedures compared to theSST without increasing complication rates. While time-savings was < 50% and maynot be ideal for every patient, the CST offers an alternative BM approachpotentially best-suited for large TBW patients and those undergoing axillaryprocedures.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4794-y PMCID: PMC6026038 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29687179
