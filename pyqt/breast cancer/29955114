[Epub ahead ofprint]Synthetic lethal therapies for cancer: what's next after PARP inhibitors?Ashworth A(1), Lord CJ(2).Author information: (1)UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, San Francisco, CA, USA. Alan.Ashworth@ucsf.edu.(2)The CRUK Gene Function Laboratory and Breast Cancer Now Toby Robins ResearchCentre, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK. Chris.Lord@icr.ac.uk.The genetic concept of synthetic lethality has now been validated clinicallythrough the demonstrated efficacy of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)inhibitors for the treatment of cancers in individuals with germlineloss-of-function mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2. Three different PARPinhibitors have now been approved for the treatment of patients with BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer and one for those with BRCA-mutant breast cancer; these agentshave also shown promising results in patients with BRCA-mutant prostate cancer.Here, we describe a number of other synthetic lethal interactions that have been discovered in cancer. We discuss some of the underlying principles that mightincrease the likelihood of clinical efficacy and how new computational andexperimental approaches are now facilitating the discovery and validation ofsynthetic lethal interactions. Finally, we make suggestions on possible futuredirections and challenges facing researchers in this field.DOI: 10.1038/s41571-018-0055-6 PMID: 29955114
