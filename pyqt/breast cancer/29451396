To report the results of the conservative management withmammographic checks of patients with ADH diagnosed by vacuum assisted breastbiopsy (VAB), without residual calcifications.METHODS: The authors accessed the institutional database of radiological,surgical and pathological anatomy. Inclusion criteria were: ADH diagnosed by VAB on a single group of microcalcifications, without residual post-procedure;follow-up at least of 12 months. Exclusion criteria were the presence of personalhistory of breast cancer or other high-risk lesions; association with othersynchronous lesions, both more and less advanced proliferative lesions.RESULTS: The 65 included patients were all females, with age range of 40-79 years(mean 54 years). The maximum diameter range of the groups of microcalcifications was 4-11 mm (mean 6.2 mm), all classified as BI-RADS 4b (Breast Imaging Reportingand Data System 4b) and defined as fine pleomorphic in 29 cases (45%) oramorphous in 36 cases (55%). The range of follow-up length was 12-156 months(mean 67 months). Only one patients developed new microcalcifications, in thesame breast, 48 months after and 15 mm from the first VAB, interpreted aslow-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) at surgical excision.CONCLUSION: These results could justify the conservative management, in aselected group of patients, being the malignancy rate lower than 2%, consideredin the literature as the "probably benign" definition. Advances in knowledge:Increasing the length of follow-up of selected patients conservatively managedcan improve the management of ADH cases.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20180003 PMID: 29451396  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
