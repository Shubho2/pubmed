Epub 2018 Mar 12.SOCS1 is associated with clinical progression and acts as an oncogenic role intriple-negative breast cancer.Qian Q(1), Lv Y(1), Li P(1).Author information: (1)Department of Thyroid and Breast Surgery, Jining No.1 People's Hospital,Jining, Shandong, China.Suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a member of SOCS family and actsas negative regulators of cytokine signaling by direct inhibition ofreceptor-associated janus kinases. The clinical significance and biologicalfunction of SOCS1 in variant tumor tissues and at variant tumor stages is stillcontroversial. The aim of our study is to confirm the expression status of SOCS1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissues and cell lines, and explore theclinical value and biological function of SOCS1 in TNBC. In microarray data sets (GDS2250 and GDS817), we observed SOCS1 was overexpressed in TNBC tissues andcell line compared with normal mammary tissues and mammary epithelial cell line, or non-TNBC tissues and cell line. Furthermore, SOCS1 mRNA and proteinoverexpression were confirmed in TNBC tissues and cell lines compared with normalmammary tissues and mammary epithelial cell lines or non-TNBC tissues and celllines. SOCS1 protein overexpression was obviously associated with advancedclinical stage, large tumor size, more lymph node metastasis, present distantmetastasis, and malign histological grade. Downregulation of SOCS1 expressionsuppressed TNBC cells proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. In conclusion,SOCS1 is associated with clinical progression in TNBC patients and acts as anoncogenic role in regulating TNBC cells proliferation and apoptosis. © 2018 IUBMBLife, 70(4):320-327, 2018.© 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.DOI: 10.1002/iub.1728 PMID: 29527785
