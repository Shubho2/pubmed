Electronicaddress: zfan@mdanderson.org.Here, we report that treatment of syngeneic mouse tumors transduced tooverexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) with the anti-humanHER2 antibody trastuzumab upregulated the level of programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1), an important negative regulator of T-cell response, in a transgenicmouse model immune-tolerant to human HER2. We further found that trastuzumabalone had no detectable effect on the level of PD-L1 expression in monoculturesof HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells but upregulated PD-L1 in thesame panel of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells when they were co-cultured with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the upregulation of PD-L1could be blocked by an IFNγ-neutralizing antibody. Inhibition of HER2 intrinsicsignaling via HER2 expression knockdown or kinase inhibition had variable andcell-context-specific effects on downregulating the PD-L1 level. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database showed no direct correlation between HER2 and PD-L1 at the messenger RNA level. Trastuzumab-mediated upregulation of PD-L1 throughengagement of immune effector cells may function as a potential mechanism oftrastuzumab resistance. Our data justify further investigation of the value ofadding anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy to trastuzumab-based treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
