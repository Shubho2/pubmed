This relation has beeninvestigated in patients with breast cancer; however, it has been little exploredin patients with other types of cancer. The objective of this study was toevaluate the occurrence of childhood trauma in patients with head and neck cancerand its association with clinicopathological variables and anxiety and depressionlevels.METHODS: The study included 110 patients with head and neck squamous cellcarcinoma (HNSCC) before they started cancer treatment. Clinicopathological andbiobehavioral data were collected from patients' medical records. Anxiety anddepression levels were assessed with the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the BeckDepression Inventory, respectively. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was usedto evaluate the occurrence of traumatic events in childhood.RESULTS: One hundred five patients (95.5%) experienced at least 1 type ofchildhood trauma. Emotional neglect was the most reported childhood trauma(43.8%), and multiple regression revealed that it was an independent variable foradvanced clinical staging (β = 2.15, P = .048) and higher alcohol consumption(β = 2.32, P = .031). Patients with HNSCC who experienced more traumatic eventsin childhood had an almost 12 times greater chance of increased depression levelsduring the pretreatment period (β = 11.89; P = .0002). The occurrence of physicalchild neglect was a predictive factor for increased anxiety levels (β = 4.17,P = 0.029).CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic events in childhood are predictive for advanced clinicalstaging, alcohol consumption, and emotional symptoms in patients with HNSCC, and they should be considered in clinical and psychological intervention strategiesduring cancer treatment.
