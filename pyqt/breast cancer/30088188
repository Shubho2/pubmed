We examined whether having a positive family breast cancer historyis associated with health behaviors/screening practices. Analyses were based on across-sectional sample of 545 Brazilian National Cancer Institute Hospitalpatients with newly diagnosed breast cancer in 2013/2014. Women were categorized according to their breast cancer family history. Age-adjusted Poisson regressionswith robust variance were performed to estimate the association between breastcancer family history and selected health-related behaviors and screeningpractices. About one fourth of women reported a positive family history of breastcancer. Contrary to expectation, we found that women with a family history ofbreast cancer did not report healthier behaviors more often than those without a family history. However, those with a family history were more likely to report amammographic exam prior to the mammographic diagnosis. Our study suggests thathaving a family history of cancer is not sufficient to change women's behaviorsabout physical activity, weight control and diet, smoking, and drinking, but itseems to influence their breast cancer screening behavior. Our results suggestthe need to increase women's information and/or understanding that healthierlifestyles contribute to cancer prevention.DOI: 10.1007/s12529-018-9737-9 PMID: 30088188
