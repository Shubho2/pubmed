[Epub ahead of print]An active and selective molecular mechanism mediating the uptake of sex steroids by prostate cancer cells.Parsons TK(1), Pratt RN(2), Tang L(2), Wu Y(3).Author information: (1)Department of Urology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm andCarlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.(2)Department of Cancer Prevention and Control, Roswell Park Comprehensive CancerCenter, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.(3)Department of Urology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm andCarlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA. Electronic address:yue.wu@roswellpark.org.Steroid hormones play important roles in normal physiological functions anddiseases. Sex steroids hormones are important in the biology and treatment of sexhormone-related cancer such as prostate cancer and breast cancer. Cells may take up steroids using multiple mechanisms. The conventionally accepted hypothesisthat steroids cross cell membrane through passive diffusion has not been testedrigorously. Experimental data suggested that cells may take up sex steroid using an active uptake mechanism. 3H-testosterone uptake by prostate cancer cellsshowed typical transporter-mediated uptake kinetic. Cells retained testosteronetaken up from the medium. The uptake of testosterone was selective for certainsteroid hormones but not others. Data also indicated that the active andselective uptake mechanism resided in cholesterol-rich membrane domains, and may involve ATP and membrane transporters. In summary, the present study providedstrong evidence to support the existence of an active and selective molecularmechanism for sex steroid uptake.Copyright Â© 2018.
