The timing and aesthetic outcome of the breastreconstruction may be affected by the need for radiation therapy (RT).Delayed-immediate autologous reconstruction (DIAR) is a novel surgical approachfor patients in whom the need for adjuvant RT after mastectomy is preoperatively unknown.AIM: We sought to evaluate the difference in clinical outcomes, patientsatisfaction, and cosmetic results between DIAR and patients who underwentdelayed autologous reconstruction.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 19 DIAR and 19 delayed patients wereretrospectively included.Patient demographics, surgical characteristics, andcomplications were obtained from patient files. Patients scored theirsatisfaction using the breast-Q questionnaire, and independent reviewers scoredcosmetic outcomes, including skin quality/color, scar formation, symmetry, breastcontour/size/position, and overall aesthetic outcome. The DIAR patients werematched to delayed patients based on age, body mass index, and unilateral orbilateral reconstruction.RESULTS: The median age in the delayed group was 48 years (range, 31-61 years)and 46 years (range, 29-64 years) in the DIAR group, with a median body massindex of 28.8 (range, 21.4-40.5) and 28.6 (range, 24-1.9), respectively.Therewere no significant differences in demographics between the two groups. In total,16 patients underwent unilateral reconstruction and 22 patients bilateralreconstruction. Delayed-immediate autologous reconstruction was associated with ahigher infection rate compared with delayed reconstruction, 8 and 1, respectively(P = 0.026). All infections in the DIAR group were tissue expander-related. TheDIAR patients had significantly better breast contour/size/position and overallaesthetics compared with the delayed reconstruction group (P = 0.001). Inaddition, patients who did not receive RT had significant better cosmetic outcome(P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in patient satisfactionbetween the DIAR and delayed group.CONCLUSION: Delayed-immediate autologous reconstruction should be considered asan option for patients wanting autologous reconstruction when the need for RTremains unknown. Delayed-immediate autologous reconstruction demonstrates better breast contour/size/position and overall aesthetic outcome.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001418 PMID: 29553980
