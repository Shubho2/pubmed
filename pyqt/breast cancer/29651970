Iran.BACKGROUND: The skin toxicity-induced by ionizing radiation may limit theduration of treatment and may lead discomfort to quality life of patients during radiotherapy.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studywas to investigate the preventive effect of oral administration of celecoxib(CLX) on the acute radiation-induced skin toxicity in patients with breastcancer.METHODS: Sixty breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to use CLX (400 mgper day) or placebo capsules during radiotherapy. Radiation-induced dermatitiswas classified according to the radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) criteria,as well as pain and itching were scored according to VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) for six weeks of treatment. Breast swelling was evaluated through increasing ofsize of breast during radiotherapy.RESULTS: Oral administration of CLX capsule during and after radiotherapy reducedsignificantly radiation-induced itching and pain in patients with breast cancer. CLX reduced the frequency of increased breast size caused by radiotherapy inpatients as compared with placebo; however, this difference was statistically no significant. Patients who received CLX had insignificantly skin dermatitis whencompared with placebo group.CONCLUSION: However, CLX was unable to reduce the dermatitis caused by ionizingradiation, it significantly reduced itching and pain in patients duringradiotherapy. CLX may have beneficial effects in quality life of breast cancerpatients for treatment.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1871523017666180411162114 PMID: 29651970
