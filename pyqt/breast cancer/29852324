Quality oflife (QOL) and psychological factors are important in fatigue-orientedinterventions for BCS, but an up-to-date overview is lacking. The aims of thisreview were to (i) provide a comprehensive overview of the relationship offatigue with QOL and factors that can be addressed in psychological interventionsfor fatigue in BCS and (ii) determine the strength of evidence for theserelationships. A systematic literature search was conducted to find studies onfatigue in BCS who had completed curative breast cancer treatment.Fatigue-related factors of 57 eligible studies were extracted and the level ofevidence was determined. Factors regarding QOL (ie, general QOL, functioning,work ability, and mental health) had a negative relationship with fatigue(moderate to strong evidence). Target factors for psychological interventionswere divided into the subcategories emotional problems, sleep disturbances,physical activity, pain, coping with cancer, dysfunctional cognitions, and socialsupport. Moderate to strong evidence appeared for a relationship of fatigue with depressive symptoms, anxiety, distress, sleep disturbances, lower physicalactivity levels, pain, difficulties with coping with cancer, and catastrophizing about symptoms. These factors are points of attention for existing and futurepsychological interventions for fatigue in BCS.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
