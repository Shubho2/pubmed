InTaiwan, traditional Chinese medicine is widely used to treat diabetes; however,its precise influence has not been empirically tested.The objective of thecase-control study is to estimate the effect on the risk of breast cancer ofusing traditional Chinese medicine for women with type 2 diabetes.More than 80%of women with type 2 diabetes have used traditional Chinese medicine. The mostcommonly prescribed drug was metformin and the herbal formulas were the Di Huang Wan series, including Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, Qi Ju Di Huang Wan, and Zhi Bai DiHuang Wan, followed by Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang and Yu Quan Wan. For the effectof metformin, women who used traditional Chinese medicine including Di Huangseries have a lower risk of breast cancer HR: 0.35 (95%CI: 0.23-0.51) in womenyounger than 55 and HR: 0.54 (95%CI: 0.37-0.79) in women older than 55.Theprotective effect of the Di Huang Wan series may be due to the synergetic effect of reducing blood glucose or increasing insulin sensitivity and delaying theinsulin resistance of cells. The relationship between the Di Huang Wan series andbreast cancer of women with type 2 diabetes requires further investigation.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011600 PMID: 30075530
