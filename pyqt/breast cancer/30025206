Here, we report on cRGD-decorated, small-sized, robust, and reduction-responsive polytyrosinemicelles (cRGD-rPTM) based on poly(ethylene glycol)- b-poly(l-tyrosine)-lipoicacid (PEG- b-PTyr-LA) conjugate for high loading and targeted delivery ofdoxorubicin (Dox). Notably, cRGD-rPTM exhibited efficient loading of Dox, giving cRGD-rPTM-Dox with a drug loading content (DLC) of 18.5 wt % and a small size of 45 nm at a theoretical DLC of 20 wt %. cRGD-rPTM-Dox displayedreduction-triggered drug release, high selectivity and superior antiproliferativeactivity toward αvβ3 integrin positive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (IC50 = 1.5μg/mL) to both nontargeted rPTM-Dox and clinical liposomal formulation (LP-Dox). cRGD-rPTM-Dox demonstrated a prolonged circulation time compared with thenoncrosslinked cRGD-PTM-Dox control and significantly better accumulation inMDA-MB-231 breast tumor xenografts than nontargeted rPTM-Dox. Moreover,cRGD-rPTM-Dox at 6 mg Dox equiv/kg could remarkably suppress growth of MDA-MB-231human breast tumor without inducing obvious side effects, outperforming bothrPTM-Dox and LP-Dox. These reduction-responsive multifunctional polytyrosinemicelles appear to be a viable and versatile nanoplatform for targetedchemotherapy.DOI: 10.1021/acs.biomac.8b00835 PMID: 30025206
