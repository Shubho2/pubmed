China.Due to the accumulating evidence that has demonstrated the vital role of cancerstem cells (CSCs) in tumor initiation, progression and metastasis, the mechanismsthat maintain the stemness of CSCs have attracted increasing attention.Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript-1 (MALAT-1), a longnon-coding RNA, which has been revealed to be associated with the malignantbehavior of tumors, performs a critical role in maintaining the stemness inseveral CSCs. In the present study, it was hypothesized that MALAT-1 promotesstem cell-like phenotypes in breast cancer cells. The present data demonstratedthat the expression of MALAT-1 was higher in the CSC subpopulation compared with that in the overall MCF7 cell group and that the knockdown of MALAT-1 decreasedthe proportion of CSCs. The self-renewal assay also demonstrated that knockdownof MALAT-1 decreased the sphere formation rate in vitro. In addition, MALAT-1 is also able to regulate the proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasionof CSCs in vitro. The underlying mechanisms may involve the regulation ofself-renewal-associated factors, including sex-determining region Y-box 2(Sox-2). Taken together, the present study demonstrated that MALAT-1 affects the stem cell-like phenotypes in breast cancer cells through regulation of Sox-2.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7557 PMCID: PMC5777122PMID: 29434914
