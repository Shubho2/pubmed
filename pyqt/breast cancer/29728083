However, prospectivestudies are limited.METHODS: We examined the detectability, reliability, and distribution ofmetabolites measured in pre-diagnostic plasma samples in a pilot study of womenenrolled in the Northern California site of the Breast Cancer Family Registry.The study included 45 cases diagnosed with breast cancer at least one year after the blood draw, and 45 controls. Controls were matched on age (within 5 years),family status, BRCA status, and menopausal status. Duplicate samples wereincluded for reliability assessment. We used a liquid chromatography/gaschromatography mass spectrometer platform to measure metabolites. We calculatedintraclass correlations (ICCs) among duplicate samples, and coefficients ofvariation (CVs) across metabolites.RESULTS: Of the 661 named metabolites detected, 338 (51%) were found in allsamples, and 490 (74%) in more than 80% of samples. The median ICC betweenduplicates was 0.96 (25th - 75th percentile: 0.82-0.99). We observed a greaterthan 20% case-control difference in 24 metabolites (p < 0.05), although theseassociations were not significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons.CONCLUSIONS: These data show that assays are reproducible for many metabolites,there is a minimal laboratory variation for the same sample, and a largebetween-person variation. Despite small sample size, differences between casesand controls in some metabolites suggest that a well-powered large-scale study islikely to detect biological meaningful differences to provide a betterunderstanding of breast cancer etiology.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4437-z PMCID: PMC5935968PMID: 29728083
