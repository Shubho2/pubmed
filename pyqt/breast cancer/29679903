Identification of the naturalinhibitory components of BCSCs is therefore critical for clinical treatment.Here, we investigated whether isoharringtonine (IHT) had inhibitory effects onBCSCs in breast cancer cell lines.METHODS: HCC1806, HCC1937, and MCF7 cells were treated with IHT. Theproliferation and the migration of cells were detected by MTS assay and woundhealing migration assay, respectively. The proportions of BCSCs were determinedby flow cytometry and tumor sphere formation assay. Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting, the expression of Nanogand activation of STAT3 were detected, respectively.RESULTS: Results showed that IHT inhibited the proliferation of HCC1806, HCC1937,and MCF-7 cells, and suppressed the migration of HCC1806 and HCC1937 cells in adose-dependent manner. IHT treatment decreased the proportion of BCSCs in MCF-7, HCC1806, and HCC1937 cells. In addition, the mRNA level of Nanong wassignificantly downregulated after IHT treatment. We also found an inhibitoryeffect of IHT on STAT3 activation.CONCLUSION: IHT inhibited the proliferation, migration, and BCSC proportion ofbreast cancer cell lines via inhibition of the STAT3/Nanong pathway.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
