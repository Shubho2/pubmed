[Epub ahead of print]Biomarker Identification for Cancer Disease Using Biclustering Approach: AnEmpirical Study.Mandal K, Sarmah R, Bhattacharyya DK.This paper presents an exhaustive empirical study to identify biomarkers usingtwo approaches: frequency-based and network-based, over seventeen differentbiclustering algorithms and six different cancer expression datasets. Tosystematically analyze the biclustering algorithms, we perform enrichmentanalysis, subtype identification and biomarker identification. Biclusteringalgorithms such as C&C, SAMBA and Plaid are useful to detect biomarkers by bothapproaches for all datasets except prostate cancer. We detect a total of 102 genebiomarkers using frequency-based method out of which 19 are for blood cancer, 36 for lung cancer, 25 for colon cancer, 13 for multi-tissue cancer and 9 forprostate cancer. Using the network-based approach we detect a total of 41 genebiomarkers of which 15 are from blood cancer, 12 from lung cancer, 6 from coloncancer, 7 from multi-tissue cancer and 1 from prostate cancer dataset. We furtherextend our network analysis over some biclusters and detect some gene biomarkers not detected earlier by both frequency-based or network-based approach. We expandour work on breast cancer miRNA expression data to evaluate the performance ofthe biclustering algorithms. We detect 19 breast cancer biomarkers byfrequency-based method and 5 by network-based method for the miRNA dataset.DOI: 10.1109/TCBB.2018.2820695 PMID: 29993834
