Forcomparison, the subjects were divided into pre- and postmenopausal groupsaccording to their menstrual history. Blood samples were analyzed for serumleptin and serum estradiol by the ELISA method. Results: Higher mean values ofserum estrogen and leptin were observed in breast cancer cases among both thepre- and postmenopausal groups. While estimating the association of serum leptin with serum estradiol, a weak positive (r = 0.186) but statistically significant(P = 0.022) correlation was found among the premenopausal subjects, while amoderate positive association (r = 0.556) was found among the postmenopausalsubjects, which had high statistical significance (P = 0.001). Furthermore,correlation coefficients (r) of the pre- and postmenopausal groups were compared using Fisher r-to-z transformation and found to have a statistically significant difference (z = 4.03, P = 0.0001). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggestthe mitogenic effects of leptin on mammary tissue via augmenting peripheralestrogen production more significantly among postmenopausal subjects. Thus, thetherapeutic modulation of leptin may be a potential adjuvant treatment for breastcancer patients with high levels of leptin along with high estrogen concentrationas a consequence.DOI: 10.3906/sag-1704-10 PMID: 29714444
