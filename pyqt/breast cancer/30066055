[Epub aheadof print]Targeting cytochrome P450-dependent cancer cell mitochondria: cancer associatedCYPs and where to find them.Guo Z(1), Johnson V(2), Barrera J(3), Porras M(3), Hinojosa D(3), Hernández I(3),McGarrah P(4), Potter DA(5).Author information: (1)Department of Medicine HOT Division and Masonic Cancer Center, University ofMinnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.(2)Macalester College, St. Paul, MN, USA.(3)Unidad de Investigación Biomedica en Cancer, Instituto Nacional deCancerología-Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico.(4)Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.(5)Department of Medicine HOT Division and Masonic Cancer Center, University ofMinnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA. dapotter@umn.edu.While cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated biosynthesis of arachidonic acid (AA)epoxides promotes tumor growth by driving angiogenesis, cancer cell intrinsicfunctions of CYPs are less understood. CYP-derived AA epoxides, calledepoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), also promote the growth of tumor epithelia. In cancer cells, CYP AA epoxygenase enzymes are associated with STAT3 and mTORsignaling, but also localize in mitochondria, where they promote the electrontransport chain (ETC). Recently, the diabetes drug metformin was found to inhibitCYP AA epoxygenase activity, allowing the design of more potent biguanides totarget tumor growth. Biguanide inhibition of EET synthesis suppresses STAT3 andmTOR pathways, as well as the ETC. Convergence of biguanide activity andeicosanoid biology in cancer has shown a new pathway to attack cancer metabolism and provides hope for improved treatments that target this vulnerability.Inhibition of EET-mediated cancer metabolism and angiogenesis therefore provides a dual approach for targeted cancer therapeutics.DOI: 10.1007/s10555-018-9749-6 PMID: 30066055
