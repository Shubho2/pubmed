However, the nature of the glycoprotein scaffolds displayingthese glycans in breast cancer remains unclear and constitutes the focus of thepresent investigation.METHODS: We isolated glycoproteins that bind E-selectin from the CF1_T breastcancer cell line, derived from a patient with ductal carcinoma. Proteins wereidentified using bottom-up proteomics approach by nanoLC-orbitrap LTQ-MS/MS. Datawere curated using bioinformatics tools to highlight clinically relevantglycoproteins, which were validated by flow cytometry, Western blot,immunohistochemistry and in-situ proximity ligation assays in clinical samples.RESULTS: We observed that the CF1_T cell line expressed sLeX, but not sLeA andthe E-selectin reactivity was mainly on N-glycans. MS and bioinformatics analysisof the targeted glycoproteins, when narrowed down to the most clinically relevantspecies in breast cancer, identified CD44 glycoprotein (HCELL) and CD13 as keyE-selectin ligands. Additionally, the co-expression of sLeX-CD44 and sLeX-CD13was confirmed in clinical breast cancer tissue samples.CONCLUSIONS: Both CD44 and CD13 glycoforms display sLeX in breast cancer and bindE-selectin, suggesting a key role in metastasis development. Such observationsprovide a novel molecular rationale for developing targeted therapeutics.GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: While HCELL expression in breast cancer has been previouslyreported, this is the first study indicating that CD13 functions as an E-selectinligand in breast cancer. This observation supports previous associations of CD13 with metastasis and draws attention to this glycoprotein as an anti-cancertarget.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
