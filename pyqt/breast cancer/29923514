The patients with LABC have high rate ofsystemic relapse, suggesting inadequacy of the current conventional staging indetecting the occult metastatic spread. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positronemission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is a new modality in the stagingof breast cancer patients. Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the roleof 18F-FDG PET/CT in initial staging of LABC and to compare it with conventional methods.Methods: This prospective study included biopsy-confirmed female patientsdiagnosed with LABC meeting the selection criteria and attending surgical,medical and radiation oncology departments of a tertiary care centre in southIndia, from April 2013 to December 2014. Conventional workup included serumchemistry, mammogram, bone scan, contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) chest and upperabdomen and ultrasound abdomen and pelvis. All patients following conventionalworkup underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT.Results: In this study, 61 women with LABC underwent both conventional workup and18F-FGD PET/CT. The 18F-FDG PET/CT, in comparison to conventional workup,revealed unsuspected N3 nodal disease in 11 more patients, revealed distantmetastasis in seven more patients and also detected extra sites of metastasis in five patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of PET/CT to detect distant metastasis were 95, 98,95, 98 and 97 per cent, respectively, whereas the sensitivity, specificity,positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of conventionalimaging to detect distant metastasis were 65, 93, 81, 84 and 84 per cent,respectively.Interpretation & conclusions: The 18F-FDG PET/CT was found to be more accuratethan conventional imaging for staging and modified stage and treatment in 30 and 38 per cent of patients, respectively. It was particularly useful in detectingoccult distant metastasis and N3 nodal disease with an added advantage ofexamining whole body in single session. However, CECT chest was superior over18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting pulmonary metastasis.DOI: 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1368_16 PMCID: PMC6022380PMID: 29923514
