[Epub ahead of print]Sparse generalized eigenvalue problem with application to canonical correlationanalysis for integrative analysis of methylation and gene expression data.Safo SE(1), Ahn J(2), Jeon Y(3), Jung S(4).Author information: (1)Division of Biostatistics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota,U.S.A.(2)Department of Statistics, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, U.S.A.(3)Department of Applied Statistics, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea.(4)Department of Statistics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.We present a method for individual and integrative analysis of high dimension,low sample size data that capitalizes on the recurring theme in multivariateanalysis of projecting higher dimensional data onto a few meaningful directionsthat are solutions to a generalized eigenvalue problem. We propose a generalframework, called SELP (Sparse Estimation with Linear Programming), with whichone can obtain a sparse estimate for a solution vector of a generalizedeigenvalue problem. We demonstrate the utility of SELP on canonical correlationanalysis for an integrative analysis of methylation and gene expression profiles from a breast cancer study, and we identify some genes known to be associatedwith breast carcinogenesis, which indicates that the proposed method is capableof generating biologically meaningful insights. Simulation studies suggest thatthe proposed method performs competitive in comparison with some existing methodsin identifying true signals in various underlying covariance structures.Â© 2018, The International Biometric Society.DOI: 10.1111/biom.12886 PMID: 29750830
