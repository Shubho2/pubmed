In thiscross-sectional study, blood pressure, plasma concentrations of vitamin D, andcalcium levels were evaluated. A 3-day dietary record was used to assess dietary intake.RESULTS: The mean body mass index was  31.2±7.0  kg/m2   for the breast cancergroup and 30.7±7.6 kg/m2 for the control group. More than 80% of the participantshad insufficient vitamin D levels (less than 75.0 nmol/L). The mean cholesterolintake was significantly (p=0.001) lower in the control group (233.1±75.1 mg)than in the breast cancer group (257.2±84.8 mg). Breast density was found to besignificantly associated with vitamin D deficiency-symptoms. Severe paresthesiawas also significantly associated with breast cancer. The incidence of othervitamin D deficiency-symptoms was significantly higher in the control group.CONCLUSION: Due to prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Saudi Arabia, it isdifficult to determine the relationship to breast cancer. The incidence of it is associated with old age and high cholesterol intake, and paresthesia may be asymptom of breast cancer.DOI: 10.15537/smj.2018.6.21902 PMCID: PMC6058747PMID: 29915850
