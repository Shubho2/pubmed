Electronic address: Edward.chow@sunnybrook.ca.AIMS: Male breast cancer is a rare disease with limited evidence-based guidelinesfor treatment. This study aimed to identify demographic, pathological andclinical factors associated with its prognosis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 161 male breast cancer patients diagnosed at a single institution from 1987 to June 2017 was conducted. Patientdemographics, disease characteristics, treatment and outcome were extracted andincluded in competing-risk analysis and the univariate Cox proportional hazardmodel for univariate analysis. Factors with P < 0.10 were included inmultivariable analysis.RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 67 years (standard deviation = 11.2) andthe median follow-up duration was 5.3 years (range 0-25 years). There were 48deaths, including 23 cancer-specific deaths. The actuarial median survival was19.9 years. In multivariable analysis, factors associated with overall survivalwere size of tumours (hazard ratio 2.0; 95% confidence interval 1.4-2.7,P < 0.0001) and diagnosis of metastatic disease (hazard ratio 8.7; 95% confidenceinterval 1.9-40.6; P = 0.006). Of 138 patients without metastases at diagnoses,11 had local-regional recurrence and 26 had distant metastases. In themultivariable model for local-regional recurrence, a more recent year ofdiagnosis was associated with reduced risk (hazard ratio 0.9, 95% confidenceinterval 0.8-1.0, P = 0.008), whereas more positive lymph nodes was associatedwith higher risk (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-4.0, P = 0.01). Ahigher risk of metastases was associated with more positive lymph nodes (hazardratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.1-3.3; P = 0.03) and tumour size (hazardratio 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.9; P = 0.01). A higher risk of anyrecurrence or metastases was associated with the number of positive nodes (hazardratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0; P = 0.005) and tumour size (hazardratio 1.6; 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.2; P = 0.01).CONCLUSION: In general, tumour size and more positive lymph nodes were associatedwith worse prognosis. Larger powered studies are needed to identify prognosticfactors with smaller effect sizes.Copyright © 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
