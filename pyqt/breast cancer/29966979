[Epub ahead of print]Calycosin inhibits nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by influencing EWSAT1expression to regulate the TRAF6-related pathways.Kong L(1), Li X(2), Wang H(1), He G(1), Tang A(3).Author information: (1)Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, 530021, China.(2)Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, China.(3)Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, 530021, China.Electronic address: gxanzhoutang@163.com.The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in China is relatively higherthan that throughout the rest of the world, and NPC is geographicallydistributed. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a key role in the development of tumors. Recent studies have found that the lncRNA Ewing sarcoma-associatedtranscript 1 (EWSAT1) is highly expressed in various tumors and also in NPCs. Theisoflavone calycosin, which is a typical Chinese herbal medicine, can inhibit thegrowth of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, osteosarcoma and other cancers. Theaim of our study was to select NPCs that were sensitive to calycosin and whether calycosin had an effect on NPC cells. If it does, are the effects related to ahigh expression of EWSAT1? We also verified that EWSAT1 was highly expressed inNPC cells. At the same time, we found that calycosin inhibited the growth of NPC cell lines. To further determine whether the effect of calycosin on NPC cells wasrelated to EWSAT1, we used NPC cells with different concentrations of calycosinand found that the expression of EWSAT1 decreased significantly with increasingconcentrations of calycosin and that the expression of downstream factors andpathways were also affected. It was demonstrated that calycosin affected NPC cellgrowth by regulating EWSAT1 and its downstream pathway. In addition, weoverexpressed EWSAT1 and found that the increased expression of EWSAT1 weakenedthe growth inhibitory effect of calycosin on NPC cells.Copyright Â© 2018.
