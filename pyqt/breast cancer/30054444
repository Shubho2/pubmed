It is postulated that this protective effect is the result of stable molecular signatures imprinted by physiological process ofpregnancy, but the molecular mechanism of this protective role is unclear. Theaim of the current study was to identify the effect of early FFTP on methylation status of FOXA1 gene body. FOXA1 is an essential transcription factor for mammarygland development and estrogen responsiveness of breast tissue.Methods: Fresh frozen normal breast tissues (n = 51) were collected from Iranian women who underwent cosmetic mammoplasty (27 nulliparous women and 24 parouswomen who have experienced first pregnancy before the age of 25). DNA wasextracted and then methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) real-time PCR wasused to assess FOXA1 gene body methylation.Results: Our results revealed that FOXA1 methylation level is significantlyhigher in early parous compared with nulliparous group (p = 0.041).Conclusion: Our study provides new hint about the association between early FFTP and epigenetic modifications within gene body of FOXA1 in normal breast tissue.More investigation is required for clarifying molecular mechanisms underlyingthis association in order to develop breast cancer prevention strategies.PMID: 30054444
