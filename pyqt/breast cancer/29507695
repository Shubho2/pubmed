We employed selective inhibitors of Chk1 and examined their effects on the proliferation and migration of mammarytumor cells as well as the development of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Further,using a mouse model of bone metastasis we evaluated the effects of Chk1inhibitors on bone quality. Chk1 inhibitors blocked the proliferation, survival, and migration of tumor cells in vitro and suppressed the development ofbone-resorbing osteoclasts by downregulating NFATc1. In the mouse model, Chk1inhibitor reduced osteolytic lesions and prevented mechanical weakening of thefemur and tibia. Analysis of RNA-seq expression data indicated that the observed effects were mediated through the regulation of eukaryotic translation initiationfactor 2 alpha, stress to the endoplasmic reticulum, S100 proteins, and boneremodeling-linked genes. Our findings suggest that targeting Chk1 signalingwithout adding DNA damaging agents may protect bone from degradation whilesuppressing tumor growth and migration.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24286 PMCID: PMC5823640PMID: 29507695
