Electronic address: sadighi@sharif.ir.(3)Novel Medical Technologies Department, Darupakhsh Pharmaceutical Co., Tehran, Iran.New dual light/temperature-responsive nanocarriers were synthesized usingbimetallic plasmonic Au-Ag and Ag-Au nanoparticles (NPs) as cores of vehicleswhich subsequently functionalized with an upper critical solubilitytemperature-based poly acrylamide-co-acrylonitrile using reversibleaddition-fragmentation chain transfer for spatiotemporally controlledchemo-photothermal synergistic cancer therapy. The bimetallic cores were assignedto sense wavelengths close to the localized surface plasmon resonance ofmonometallic NP shell to produce heat which not only can increase the surroundingtemperature over the upper critical solubility temperature of polymer to open itsvalves and promote drug diffusion but also can kill cancerous cells throughphotothermal effects with increase in environment temperature by nearly 18°Cafter about 5 min radiation. The bimetallic NPs were shown good reusability even after 5 heating/cooling cycles, and the efficiency of bothphotothermal/chemotherapic procedures can be modulated by manipulating carrier's concentration and radiation time. In addition, the cytotoxicity of drug-freenanocarriers on normal L929 fibroblast and letrozole-loaded nanocarriers on MDAMB231 breast-cancer cell lines were investigated in the absence/presence of laserradiation. Finally, the prepared nanocomposites were exhibited switchable on/off drug release in 2 buffered solutions (pH 5.5 and 7.4) with light actuation. Theresults revealed that the prepared nanocarriers can be served as efficientdelivery platforms for remote-control chemophotothermal synergistic cancertherapy.Copyright © 2018 American Pharmacists Association®.
