Late distant recurrence ofbreast carcinoma after more than 20 years is extremely rare. Herein, we report a 57-year-old woman with late distant recurrence and metastasis to the mainbronchus and choroid almost 28 years after surgery.PATIENT CONCERNS: At the age of 29, the patient underwent chemotherapy andendocrine treatment after a right side mastectomy to remove breast carcinoma. Thepatient was hospitalized for a cough with blood-tinged sputum, dysphagia, andblurred vision in the left eye at the age of 57.DIAGNOSES: On evaluation, laboratory findings detected the elevated serum tumormarkers of CA12-5, CA15-3, NSE, and Cyfra21-1. The imaging showed left lungmetastase, multiple lymph node metastases, and small suspected metastases in the both sides of parietal lobes. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed choroidaloccupying lesion of the left side which indicates secondary metastasis andretinal detachment. Combined with the pathological finding via fiberopticbronchoscopic biopsy, the patient was clinically diagnosed with a late distantrecurrence of breast carcinoma.INTERVENTIONS: The patient received oral endocrine therapy of letrozole, but she refused chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other topical treatments.OUTCOMES: At the 3-month follow-up visit, the multiple lesions of the left lungand lymph nodes had partially regressed, and the lesion of right parietal lobehad disappeared. The patient's clinical symptoms, such as blood-tinged sputum anddysphagia, had significantly improved.LESSONS: We have described this case and reviewed the relevant literatureconcerning late distant recurrence of breast carcinoma. Importantly, this caseindicates that patients with HR positive breast carcinoma are more likely todevelop late distant recurrence and clinicians should not ignore the follow-upexaminations even more than 20 years after the surgery.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010754 PMCID: PMC5976331PMID: 29768356  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
