This pre-clinical study evaluates the impact of variousparameters on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of in vivo expressed DNA-basedanti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), newly engineered and delivered viaintramuscular electrotransfer in mice. Plasma concentrations of trastuzumab and4D5, its murine IgG1 equivalent, peaked on average between 1-15 µg/ml, depending on the administration and configuration of the encoding plasmid DNA (pDNA). Adual expression cassette system outperformed a single 2A-based cassette, and the CAG promoter was superior to a muscle-specific ΔUSE-based promoter. A 'genetherapy-compatible' Gene Transport Unit (gtGTU, FIT Biotech), a plasmid backbone that co-encodes viral elements, failed to improve in vivo reporter and mAbexpression compared to a conventional plasmid. In BALB/c mice, trastuzumabdetection was lost within two weeks after pDNA administration due to anti-drugantibodies. This host immune response was addressed by expressing trastuzumab in immune-compromised mice, or by gene transfer of murine 4D5 in BALB/c mice. Bothapproaches maintained single-digit µg/ml mAb concentrations for at least six tonine months, and allowed to boost mAb expression over time by pDNA re-dosing. In a breast cancer mouse model, prophylactic and therapeutic DNA-based trastuzumabor 4D5 led to complete tumor regressions, thereby rivalling with theadministration of milligrams of mAb protein. In conclusion, our studydemonstrates proof of concept for antibody gene transfer in cancer, providescritical insights in the engineering and application of DNA-based antibodies, andserves to advance this modality in oncology and beyond.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24426 PMCID: PMC5862603PMID: 29568382
