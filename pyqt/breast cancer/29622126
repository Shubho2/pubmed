Electronic address:hlepetross@mdanderson.org.(2)Department of Breast Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1155 Pressler Street, Houston, TX 77030, USA.Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has become an important treatment approach forstage II/III breast cancers to downsize tumor and enable breast-conservingsurgery for patients that may otherwise undergo mastectomy. MR imaging has thepotential to identify early response or disease progression, enabling potentialmodification to NAC regimens. Detection of size and morphologic changes is betterappreciated with MR imaging than other modalities and is different betweenmolecular subtypes of breast cancer. The combination of DCE-MR imaging and DWIprovides the highest sensitivity and specificity. Other new modalities such asFDG PET/MR imaging and molecular breast imaging are still undergoing research.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.mric.2017.12.011 PMID: 29622126
