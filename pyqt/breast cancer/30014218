We aimedto determine the characteristics of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC)subtypes in males and females, and to compare their clinical behavior andsurvival. A total of 68,337 cases were recruited from the National CancerInstitute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Thedisease-specific survival (DSS) of follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma(FVPTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) were similar to that of classical variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (CPTC) in male patients (FVPTC vs. CPTC,adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.947, P = 0.776; FTC vs. CPTC, aHR = 1.512,P = 0.104). In premenopausal female (< 55 years old), FVPTC had better DSS thanCPTC (aHR = 0.321, P = 0.038) while FTC had worse DSS than CPTC (aHR = 3.272,P = 0.013); in postmenopausal female, FTC had poorer prognosis than CPTC(aHR = 2.145, P = 0.002), no statistical difference was found between CPTC andFVPTC (aHR = 0.724, P = 0.087). For patients younger than 55 years, women hadsignificantly better DSS compared with men with CPTC (aHR = 0.376, P < 0.001) andFVPTC (aHR = 0.102, P < 0.001). However, no difference was observed in patientsolder than 55 years. Interestingly, outcomes of FTC were not affected by genderin patients of all ages. These results suggested that different clinicalbehaviors and outcomes of DTC subtypes should be considered in patients withdifferent genders.DOI: 10.1007/s12672-018-0340-y PMID: 30014218
