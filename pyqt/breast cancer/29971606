[Epub ahead of print]"I Am Uncertain About What My Uncertainty Even Is": Men's Uncertainty andInformation Management of Their BRCA-Related Cancer Risks.Rauscher EA(1), Dean M(2), Campbell-Salome GM(3).Author information: (1)Department of Communication, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.erauscher@tamu.edu.(2)University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.(3)Department of Communication, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.Men with a germline pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant have increased risks fordeveloping breast, pancreatic, prostate, and melanoma cancers, but little isknown about how they understand and manage their cancer risks. This studyexamines how men with BRCA-related cancer risks manage uncertainty andinformation about their risks. Twenty-five men who were either a BRCA carrier or have a BRCA-positive first-degree family member that put the participant at 50%chance of also being a BRCA carrier were interviewed for this study. Usinguncertainty management theory as a theoretical framework, this study demonstratesthat men manage uncertainty by seeking information from female family members,websites, and healthcare providers, and are under-informed about their cancerrisks. Further, in handling their information, men prefer information aboutcancer risk percentages and screening recommendations in the form of listspresented to them via websites, printed literature, proactive healthcareproviders, and an identifiable male spokesperson. Finally, men used BRCA-related cancer risk information to make decisions about whether or not to engage inscreening and prevention, manage their BRCA-related cancer risks, and overallfamily well-being-yet often at the expense of their own individual risks.Implications for genetic counseling and family conversations are discussed.DOI: 10.1007/s10897-018-0276-y PMID: 29971606
