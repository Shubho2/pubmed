We conducted an educational program for non-physician health careproviders regarding fertility preservation and evaluated the effects of theeducational program.METHODS: The 4-h educational program consisted of lectures about infertility as apotential risk of cancer treatment, fertility preservation, and psychosocialsupport. Knowledge, confidence, institutional change, and self-practice wereassessed pre-program, immediately post-program, and 6 months post-program.RESULTS: Of 124 participants who joined the program, 74 completed and returnedthe follow-up survey 6 months after the program. Sixty-one percent of theparticipants were nurses, 27% were social workers, and 4% were psychologists. Thescores for confidence and knowledge increased between pre- and immediatepost-program periods (p < 0.01), and between pre- and 6-month post-programperiods (p < 0.01). The knowledge score was 52, 76, and 71% at the 3 pointsrespectively. The participants became more likely to disseminate fertilitypreservation counseling at their institutions (p < 0.01) and use informationalresources (p < 0.01). Overall, self-practice and institutional support did notchange.CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that this educational program is applicable fornon-physicians to learn about fertility preservation. The participants improvedsignificantly in confidence and knowledge, but not in counseling skills.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4217-y PMID: 29681013
