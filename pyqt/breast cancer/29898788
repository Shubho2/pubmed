Preclinically, pixatimod inhibits heparanase (HPSE) which may beassociated with its inhibitory effect on TAMs whereas its immunostimulatoryactivity on DCs is through the MyD88-dependent TLR9 pathway. Pixatimod recentlycompleted a Phase Ia monotherapy trial in advanced cancer patients.METHODS: To characterize the safety of pixatimod administered by intravenous (IV)infusion, a one month toxicology study was conducted to support a Phase Iamonotherapy clinical trial. The relative exposure (AUC) of pixatimod acrossrelevant species was determined and the influence of route of administration onthe immunomodulatory activity was also evaluated. Finally, the potential utility of pixatimod in combination with PD-1 inhibition was also investigated using the syngeneic 4T1.2 breast cancer model.RESULTS: The nonclinical safety profile revealed that the main toxicitiesassociated with pixatimod are elevated cholesterol, triglycerides, APTT,decreased platelets and other changes symptomatic of modulating the immune systemsuch as pyrexia, changes in WBC subsets, inflammatory changes in liver, spleenand kidney. Though adverse events such as fever, elevated cholesterol andtriglycerides were reported in the Phase Ia trial, none were considered doselimiting toxicities and the compound was well tolerated up to 100 mg via IVinfusion. Exposure (AUC) up to 100 mg was considered proportional with someaccumulation upon repeated dosing, a phenomenon also noted in the toxicologystudy. The immunomodulatory activity of pixatimod was independent of the route ofadministration and it enhanced the effectiveness of PD-1 inhibition in a poorlyimmunogenic tumor model.CONCLUSIONS: Pixatimod modulates innate immune cells but also enhances T cellinfiltration in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy. The safety and PK profile of the compound supports its ongoing development in a Phase Ib study for advancedcancer/pancreatic adenocarcinoma with the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab(Opdivo®).TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02042781 .
