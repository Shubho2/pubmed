China.Collagen type V α1 chain (COL5A1) is a minor fibrillar collagen in mammals thatco-polymerizes with type I collagen to adjust the diameter of collagen molecules.However, the function of COL5A1 in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the humanbreast remains unknown. In the present study, our group examined the expressionof COL5A1 in IDC compared with its adjacent normal tissue and fibroadenoma of thebreast. COL5A1 was revealed to be overexpressed in IDC compared with benign tumorand adjacent normal control tissues, and was associated with the expression ofestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. No association between COL5A1expression and tumor size, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, age, or Her2expression was identified. High expression of COL5A1 mRNA was associated withdistant metastasis free survival in patients with breast cancer. Knockdown ofCOL5A1 led to a decrease of cell viability, as detected by the WST-1 assay, andan inhibition of migration and invasion, as detected by wound healing andTranswell assays, respectively, in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Theexpression of COL5A1 in MCF-7 cells was downregulated by transforming growthfactor (TGF)‑β1, which was abolished in the presence of SB-431542, an inhibitorof TGF-β type I receptor. In conclusion, these data indicated that COL5A1 isoverexpressed in IDC and regulated by TGF-β1, suggesting that an increase ofCOL5A1 reflects tumor progression and may serve as a novel biomarker andtherapeutic target for the treatment of breast IDC.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4317 PMID: 29568948
