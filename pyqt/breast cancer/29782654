[Epub ahead of print]DDX3X RNA helicase affects breast cancer cell cycle progression by regulatingexpression of KLF4.Cannizzaro E(1), Bannister AJ(1), Han N(1), Alendar A(1), Kouzarides T(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge,Cambridge, UK.DDX3X is a multifunctional RNA helicase with documented roles in different cancertypes. Here, we demonstrate that DDX3X plays an oncogenic role in breast cancercells by modulating the cell cycle. Depletion of DDX3X in MCF7 cells slows cellproliferation by inducing a G1 phase arrest. Notably, DDX3X inhibits expressionof Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a transcription factor and cell cycle repressor.Moreover, DDX3X directly interacts with KLF4 mRNA and regulates its splicing. We show that DDX3X-mediated repression of KLF4 promotes expression of S-phaseinducing genes in MCF7 breast cancer cells. These findings provide evidence for anovel function of DDX3X in regulating expression and downstream functions ofKLF4, a master negative regulator of the cell cycle.Â© 2018 The Authors.
