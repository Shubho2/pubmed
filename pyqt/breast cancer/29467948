The aim of this study was to evaluate if thenCounter NanoString assay could be used for accurate gene expression profiling ofCTCs using the PAM50 research-use-only CodeSet. Analysis was performed on CTCsisolated by the ANGLE Parsortix system from healthy blood spiked with the breast cancer cell lines Hs578T, SkBr3, MDA-MB-231 or MCF7. Using cell lines as goldstandard positive controls and Parsortix processed blood without spiking(unspiked) as negative controls, we found an average of 12 significantlydifferentially expressed genes among spiked samples versus unspiked controls. We validated our findings with the NanoStringDiff differential expressionstatistical method. The NanoString recommended targeted pre-amplificationintroduced false positive results due to pre-amplification bias, and theamplification of non-cancer genes from normal leukocytes confounded geneexpression profiling of CTCs. Pre-amplification bias is a concern for othersimilar assays that may be used as discovery tools or target validation oftranscripts of interest in gene expression profiling of CTCs. We recommend theuse of an unspiked negative control when evaluating CTC technologies regardinggene expression profiling. Given that the molecular profiling of CTCs as a liquidbiopsy may have clinical ramifications for potential treatment selection infuture clinical trials, our study emphasizes cautious consideration ofpre-analytical variables such as amplification bias in the context of liquidbiopsy studies.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24140 PMCID: PMC5805534PMID: 29467948
