[Epub ahead of print]Chemoprevention acceptance and adherence in women with high-risk breast lesions.Roche CA(1), Tang R(1), Coopey SB(1), Hughes KS(1).Author information: (1)Division of Surgical Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA,USA.Patients with atypical hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (atypicalbreast lesions) are at high risk of developing breast cancer, and chemopreventionhas been shown to confer a substantial reduction in that risk. Despite this, the overall rate of chemoprevention utilization in this group is low. This studyevaluates the efficacy of a formal individualized education and counselingsession on patient acceptance and adherence to chemoprevention. Patients withatypical breast lesions having an individualized education and counseling sessionin a single surgical oncology practice were prospectively entered into a databasefrom 2001 to 2016, and with IRB approval, their data were analyzed.Chemoprevention recommendations, acceptance, duration of treatment, and sideeffects were recorded. A total of 536 patients were included in this study. Mean age at diagnosis was 52 years (range: 19-86 years). Chemoprevention wasrecommended for 386 (72%) of whom 199 (52%) elected to take medication orparticipate in a chemoprevention clinical trial. At the time of this writing, 72 patients had completed therapy, 69 were still in treatment, and 58 had stoppedchemoprevention prematurely. Approximately 55% of the women who acceptedchemoprevention in this study will complete 5 years of therapy. A formalindividualized education and counseling session can improve chemopreventionacceptance and achieve a reasonable completion rate, thus reducing cancerincidence in women with atypical breast lesions.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13064 PMID: 29785770
