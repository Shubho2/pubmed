Although the mortality rate of patients with GC has improved, itremains a significant health issue. The MYC proto-oncogene protein serves keyroles in cellular proliferation, differentiation, transformation and apoptosis.Previous studies have identified the abnormal expression of MYC-binding protein(MYCBP) during tumorigenesis in multiple types of cancer. Furthermore, evidencedemonstrates that the abnormal expression of MYCBP contributes to the invasionand migration of human cancer types, including colon cancer and glioma; however, its influence on GC remains unclear. In the present study, the expression ofMYCBP in GC cells and tissues was analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, GC cell lines were transfected withsmall interfering RNAs against MYCBP or lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1(LEF-1) and assessed by in vitro transwell migration and invasion assays. Theresults indicated that the expression of MYCBP in GC cells and tissues wasmarkedly increased compared with a normal gastric epithelial cell line andadjacent normal gastric mucosal tissues, respectively. Furthermore, MYCBPdownregulation notably inhibited the metastatic capacity of GC cells, and LEF-1knockdown was found to downregulate the expression of MYCBP. On the basis of the findings of the present study, MYCBP may be a direct target of theÎ²-catenin/LEF-1 pathway via binding LEF-1, and could potentially be used as abiomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of GC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7944 PMCID: PMC5840499PMID: 29552163
