[Epub ahead ofprint]Expression and function of hexose transporters GLUT1, GLUT2, and GLUT5 in breast cancer-effects of hypoxia.Hamann I(1), Krys D(1), Glubrecht D(1), Bouvet V(1), Marshall A(1), Vos L(1),Mackey JR(1), Wuest M(1), Wuest F(1).Author information: (1)Department of Oncology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.Elevated growth in breast cancer (BC) activates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1α) and downstream, facilitative glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), which can bevisualized with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose ([18F]FDG). GLUT5 (fructose) and GLUT2 (glucose/fructose) might provide alternative targets for BC imaging as towhy effects of hypoxia on GLUT1/2/5 levels and function were examined in human BCmodels. GLUT1/2/5 and HIF1α mRNA was analyzed in BC patient biopsies. In MCF10A, MCF7, and MDA-MB231 cells, [18F]FDG, 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-d-fructose(6-[18F]FDF) and [18F]-fluoroazomycin arabinoside were used in radiotracerexperiments, whereas GLUT1/2/5 mRNA was analyzed with real-time PCR and proteinlevels determined via Western blot/immunohistochemistry. Positron emissiontomography imaging was performed in MCF7 and MDA-MB231 tumor-bearing mice.Glucose/fructose/cytochalasin B reduced cellular 6-[18F]FDF uptake by 50%,indicating functional involvement of GLUT2. With GLUT5 staining lower than GLUT1,6-[18F]FDF revealed lower uptake than [18F]FDG [standardized uptake value(SUV)6-[18F]FDF, 120 min 0.77 ± 0.06 vs. SUV[18F]FDG, 120 min 1.08 ± 0.07] inMDA-MB231 tumors and was blocked by 20% with cytochalasin B after 10 min. Whereascorrespondence between 6-[18F]FDF uptake and GLUT5 protein was low, high GLUT2levels were detected in all cell lines and tumor models. Besides GLUT1, GLUT5seems to be regulated under hypoxia on the molecular and functional level.Additionally, results strongly support a functional involvement of GLUT2 infructose metabolism, possibly by compensating for the weaker expression andfunction of GLUT5 in BC.-Hamann, I., Krys, D., Glubrecht, D., Bouvet, V.,Marshall, A., Vos, L., Mackey, J.
