The tumor composed ofepithelial -myoepithelial carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma was not reported previously.PATIENT CONCERNS: An 81-year-old woman presented with a palpable nodule in theleft breast for 4 days. The ultrasonography showed multinodular growth andfocally indistinct borders. Owing to her advanced age and possible early clinicalstaging, primary tumor resection was performed. One year later, a small and slow growing subcutaneous nodule was found under the incision of the left breast.Ultrasonography revealed an irregular, cystic and solid, hypoechoic mass withcircumscribed borders.DIAGNOSES: Microscopic examination of the primary tumor revealed epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The former had a variety ofarchitecture patterns, including nests, lobulations, papillary and tubularstructures, and the latter showed varying morphological features, from squamouspearls to spindle cells. The recurrent tumor showed only epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma with more aggressively malignant features than thoseseen in the primary tumor.INTERVENTIONS: An extensive resection of the left breast mass was performed forthe recurrent tumor. The patient did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy orradiation therapy because of the patient's advanced age.OUTCOMES: The patient has been followed up for 1.5 years after second surgerywithout evidence of tumor recurrence and metastasis.LESSONS: Wide local excision with adequate margins is recommended for elderlypatients with metaplastic breast carcinoma composed of epithelial -myoepithelial carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010364 PMCID: PMC5908572PMID: 29642184  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
