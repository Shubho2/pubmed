Here we show that production of interleukin (IL)-1β in primarybreast cancer (BC) tumors is linked to advanced disease and originates fromtumor-infiltrating CD11c+ myeloid cells. IL-1β production was triggered by cancercell membrane-derived TGF-β, and neutralizing TGF-β or IL-1 receptor prevented BCprogression in a humanized mouse model. Patients with metastatic HER2-negative BCdisplayed a transcriptional signature of inflammation in the blood leukocytes,which was attenuated by IL-1 blockade. When present in primary BC tumors, thissignature discriminated patients with poor clinical outcomes in two independentpublic datasets (TCGA and METABRIC).Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-0413 PMID: 30012670
