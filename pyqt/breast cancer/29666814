Chest radiography (CR) is a basic technique forthe investigation of lung cancer and has the benefit of convenience and lowradiation dose, but detection of malignancy is often difficult. The introduction of computed tomography (CT) for screening has increased the proportion of lungcancer detected but with higher exposure dose and higher costs. Digital chesttomosynthesis (DCT), a tomographic technique, may offer an alternative to CT. DCTuses a conventional radiograph tube, a flat-panel detector, a computer-controlledtube mover and reconstruction algorithms to produce section images. It showspromise in the detection of potentially malignant lung nodules, with highersensibility than CR, and is emerging as a low-dose and low-cost alternative to CTto improve treatment decisions. In fact, an increasing number of researchers are showing that tomosynthesis could have a role in the detection of lung cancer, in addition to its present role in breast screening. However, DCT offers somelimitations, such as limited depth resolution, which may explain the difficultyin detecting pathologies in the subpleural region and the occurrence of artefactsfrom medical devices. Once solved these limitations and once more studiessupporting its use will be available, DCT could become the first-line lung cancerscreening tool among patients at considerable risk of lung cancer.DOI: 10.21037/atm.2017.08.18 PMCID: PMC5890049PMID: 29666814
