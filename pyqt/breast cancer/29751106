Electronic address: christopher.gerner@univie.ac.at.Proteome profiling profoundly contributes to the understanding of cell responsemechanisms to drug actions. Such knowledge may become a key to improvepersonalized medicine. In the present study, the effects of the natural remedycurcumin on breast cancer model systems were investigated. MCF-7, ZR-75-1 andTGF-β1 pretreated fibroblasts, mimicking cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs),were treated independently as well as in tumor cell/CAF co-cultures. Remarkably, co-culturing with CAF-like cells (CLCs) induced different proteome alterations inMCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells, respectively. Curcumin significantly induced HMOX1 insingle cell type models and co-cultures. However, other curcumin effectsdiffered. In the MCF-7/CLC co-culture, curcumin significantly down-regulatedRC3H1, a repressor of inflammatory signaling. In the ZR-75-1/CLC co-culture,curcumin significantly down-regulated PEG10, an anti-apoptotic protein, andinduced RRAGA, a pro-apoptotic protein involved in TNF-alpha signaling.Furthermore, curcumin induced AKR1C2, an important enzyme for progesteronemetabolism. None of these specific curcumin effects were observed in single cell type cultures. All high-resolution mass spectrometry data are available viaProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD008719. The present data demonstrate that curcumin induces proteome alterations, potentially accounting for its knownantitumor effects, in a strongly context-dependent fashion.BIOLOGICALSIGNIFICANCE: Better means to understand and potentially predict individualvariations of drug effects are urgently required. The present proteome profiling study of curcumin effects demonstrates the massive impact of the cellmicroenvironment on cell responses to drug action. Co-culture models apparentlyprovide more biologically relevant information regarding curcumin effects thansingle cell type cultures.Copyright © 2018.
