We prospectively evaluatedthe efficacy of cryotherapy for CIPN prevention.Methods: Breast cancer patients treated weekly with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 for one hour) wore frozen gloves and socks on the dominant side for 90 minutes, includingthe entire duration of drug infusion. Symptoms on the treated sides were comparedwith those on the untreated (nondominant) sides. The primary end point was CIPNincidence assessed by changes in tactile sensitivity from pretreatment baselinein a monofilament test at a cumulative dose of 960 mg/m2. We also assessedthermosensory deficits, subjective symptoms (Patient Neuropathy Questionnaire[PNQ]), manipulative dexterity, and the time to events and hazard ratio by PNQ.All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: Among the 40 patients, four did not reach the cumulative dose (due tothe occurrence of pneumonia, severe fatigue, severe liver dysfunction, andmacular edema), leaving 36 patients for analysis. None dropped out due to coldintolerance. The incidence of objective and subjective CIPN signs was clinically and statistically significantly lower on the intervention side than on thecontrol (hand: tactile sensitivity = 27.8% vs 80.6%, odds ratio [OR] = 20.00, 95%confidence interval [CI] = 3.20 to 828.96, P < .001; foot: tacile sensitivity =25.0% vs 63.9%, OR = infinite, 95% CI = 3.32 to infinite, P < .001; hand: warmsense = 8.8% vs 32.4%, OR = 9.00, 95% CI = 1.25 to 394.48, P = .02; foot: warmsense: 33.4% vs 57.6%, OR = 5.00, 95% CI = 1.07 to 46.93, P = .04; hand: PNQ =2.8% vs 41.7%, OR = infinite, 95% CI = 3.32 to infinite, P < .001; foot: PNQ =2.8% vs 36.1%, OR = infinite, 95% CI = 2.78 to infinite, P < .001; hand: hazardratio [HR] = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.34; foot: HR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.38,dexterity mean delay = -2.5 seconds, SD = 12.0 seconds, vs + 8.6 seconds,SD = 25.8 seconds, P = .005).Conclusions: Cryotherapy is useful for preventing both the objective andsubjective symptoms of CIPN and resultant dysfunction.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djx178 PMCID: PMC6007752PMID: 29924336
