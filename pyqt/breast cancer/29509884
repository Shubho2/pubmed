Concerning previous anti-HCVtherapies, pharmacogenetics had a significant impact, particularly consideringthe association of interleukin28B polymorphisms with dual-therapy(ribavirin + pegylated IFN) outcomes.Objectives: In this work, we investigated the association between sofosbuvir and its prevalent metabolite (GS-331007) plasma concentrations at 1 month of therapy and genetic variants (SNPs) in genes encoding transporters and nuclear factors(ABCB1, ABCG2 and HNF4α) related to sofosbuvir transport.Patients and methods: Allelic discrimination was performed through real-time PCR,whereas plasma concentrations were evaluated through liquid chromatography. Onehundred and thirteen patients were enrolled.Results: Sofosbuvir concentrations were below the limit of quantification sincethe drug was converted into its GS-331007 metabolite. ABCB1 2677 G>T (P = 0.044) and HNF4α 975 C>G (P = 0.049) SNPs were associated with GS-331007 metaboliteplasma concentrations. In linear multivariate analysis, liver stiffness, insulin resistance, baseline haemoglobin and haematocrit and SNPs in the ABCB1 gene (3435CT/TT and 1236 TT genotypes) were significant predictors of GS-331007concentrations. Furthermore, we performed sub-analyses considering the anti-HCVconcomitant drug and HCV genotype, identifying specific polymorphisms associated with GS-331007 plasma concentrations: ABCB1 3435 C>T and HNF4α975 C>G in patientstreated with daclatasvir, ABCB1 2677 G>T with ledipasvir and ABCB1 3435 C>T,ABCB1 2677 G>T, ABCG2 421 C>A and ABCG2 1194 + 928 C>A with ribavirin.Conclusions: In this study we suggested sofosbuvir GS-331007 metabolite plasmalevels were affected by variants in the ABCB1 and HNFα genes.DOI: 10.1093/jac/dky053 PMID: 29509884
