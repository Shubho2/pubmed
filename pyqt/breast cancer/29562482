An important differential diagnosis inpostmenopausal patients presenting with a rapidly growing breast cyst. Managementand literature review.Salemis NS.Intracystic breast carcinoma is a rare clinical entity accounting for 0.5-2% ofall breast cancers. It represents a distinctive clinical form rather ahistological subtype of breast cancer and can either be in situ or invasivetumor. We herein describe a rare case of intracystic breast carcinoma arisingfrom the wall of a cyst in a postmenopausal patient, who presented with a rapidlygrowing complex breast cyst. Diagnostic evaluation and management of the patient are discussed along with a review of the literature. Complex breast cysts mayrepresent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. An underlying malignancy hasbeen reported in 21-31% of the cases. Preoperative diagnosis is challenging.Complex breast cysts with thick wall, thick inner septations, and intracysticsolid components should undergo histological evaluation in order to rule out anunderlying malignancy. The cytological analysis may be inconclusive.Ultrasound-guided biopsy is the diagnostic modality of choice. The correlation ofclinical features, with imaging and histopathological findings is very important for the optimal treatment. In cases of discordance, a complete surgical excision is necessary with careful assessment of the extent of the disease and appropriatetreatment.DOI: 10.3233/BD-170316 PMID: 29562482
