This overall risk estimate is for all BRCA1 variants; obviously, not all variants confer the same risk of developing a disease. In cancerpatients, loss of BRCA1 function in tumor tissue has been associated with anincreased sensitivity to platinum agents and to poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase(PARP) inhibitors. For clinical management of both at-risk individuals and cancerpatients, it would be important that each identified genetic variant beassociated with clinical significance. Unfortunately for the vast majority ofvariants, the clinical impact is unknown. The availability of results fromstudies assessing the impact of variants on protein function may provide insight of crucial importance.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We have collected, curated, and structured the molecular and cellular phenotypic impact of 3654 distinct BRCA1 variants. The data wasmodeled in triple format, using the variant as a subject, the studied function asthe object, and a predicate describing the relation between the two. Eachannotation is supported by a fully traceable evidence. The data was capturedusing standard ontologies to ensure consistency, and enhance searchability andinteroperability. We have assessed the extent to which functional defects at the molecular and cellular levels correlate with the clinical interpretation ofvariants by ClinVar submitters. Approximately 30% of the ClinVar BRCA1 missensevariants have some molecular or cellular assay available in the literature.Pathogenic variants (as assigned by ClinVar) have at least some significantfunctional defect in 94% of testable cases. For benign variants, 77% of ClinVarbenign variants, for which neXtProt Cancer variant portal has data, shows either no or mild experimental functional defects. While this does not provide evidence for clinical interpretation of variants, it may provide some guidance forvariants of unknown significance, in the absence of more reliable data. TheneXtProt Cancer variant portal ( https://www.nextprot.org/portals/breast-cancer )contains over 6300 observations at the molecular and/or cellular level for BRCA1 variants.DOI: 10.1186/s40246-018-0168-0 PMCID: PMC6042458PMID: 29996917
