Par-4 induces apoptosis selectively in varioustypes of cancer cells but not normal cells. We found that chronic lymphocyticleukemia (CLL) cells from human patients and from Eµ-Tcl1 mice constitutivelyexpress Par-4 in greater amounts than normal B-1 or B-2 cells. Interestingly,knockdown of Par-4 in human CLL-derived Mec-1 cells results in a robust increase in p21/WAF1 expression and decreased growth due to delayed G1-to-S cell-cycletransition. Lack of Par-4 also increased the expression of p21 and delayed CLLgrowth in Eμ-Tcl1 mice. Par-4 expression in CLL cells required constitutivelyactive B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, as inhibition of BCR signaling with USFood and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs caused a decrease in Par-4messenger RNA and protein, and an increase in apoptosis. In particular,activities of Lyn, a Src family kinase, spleen tyrosine kinase, and Brutontyrosine kinase are required for Par-4 expression in CLL cells, suggesting anovel regulation of Par-4 through BCR signaling. Together, these results suggest that Par-4 may play a novel progrowth rather than proapoptotic role in CLL andcould be targeted to enhance the therapeutic effects of BCR-signaling inhibitors.© 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.DOI: 10.1182/blood-2017-10-813931 PMCID: PMC6024641 [Available on 2019-06-28]PMID: 29695515
