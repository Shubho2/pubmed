The epithelial-mesenchymal transition is the firstsignal of metastasis involving different transcription factors such as Snail,TWIST, and ZEB1. ECM remodeling is a major event promoting cancer invasion andmetastasis; where matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-2, -9, -11, and-14 play vital roles degrading the matrix proteins for cancer spread. The Î²-Dmannuronic acid (MMP inhibitor) has anti-metastatic properties through inhibitionof MMP-2, and -9 and could be a potential therapeutic agent. Besides the MMPs,the enzymes such as LOXL2, LOXL4, procollagen lysyl hydroxylase-2, and heparanasealso regulate breast cancer progression. The important ECM proteins likeintegrins (b1-, b5-, and b6- integrins), ECM1 protein, and Hic-5 protein are alsoactively involved in breast cancer development. The stromal cells such astumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), andadipocytes also contribute in tumor development through different processes. The TAMs become proangiogenic through secretion of VEGF-A and building vessel networkfor nourishment and invasion of the tumor mass. The latest developments of ECMinvolvement in breast cancer progression has been discussed in this review andthis study will help researchers in designing future work on breast cancerpathogenesis and developing therapy targeted to the ECM components.DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.14133.2 PMCID: PMC6020719PMID: 29983921
