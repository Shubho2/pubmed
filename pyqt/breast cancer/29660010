Health services factors, such as insurance benefit type andcare source, may impact costs to the health system. Beneficiaries in the U.S.Military Health System (MHS) have universal healthcare coverage and access to anetwork of military facilities (direct care) and private practices (purchasedcare). This study aims to quantify and compare breast cancer care costs to theMHS by insurance benefit type and care source.Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data linkedbetween the MHS data repository administrative claims and central cancer registrydatabases. The institutional review boards of the Walter Reed National MilitaryMedical Center, the Defense Health Agency, and the National Institutes of Health Office of Human Subjects Research reviewed and approved the data linkage. We usedthe linked data to identify records for women aged 40-64 yr who were diagnosedwith breast cancer between 2003 and 2007 and to extract information on insurance benefit type, care source, and cost to the MHS for breast cancer treatment. Weestimated per capita costs for breast cancer care by benefit type and care sourcein 2008 USD using generalized linear models, adjusted for demographic,pathologic, and treatment characteristics.Results: The average per capita (n = 2,666) total cost for breast cancer care was$66,300 [standard error (SE) $9,200] over 3.31 (1.48) years of follow-up. Totalcosts were similar between benefit types, but varied by care source. The average per capita cost was $34,500 ($3,000) for direct care (n = 924), $96,800 ($4,800) for purchased care (n = 622), and $60,700 ($3,900) for both care sources (n =1,120), respectively. Care source differences remained by tumor stage and forchemotherapy, radiation, and hormone therapy treatment types.Conclusions: Per capita costs to the MHS for breast cancer care were similar bybenefit type and lower for direct care compared with purchased care. Furtherresearch is needed in breast and other tumor sites to determine patterns anddeterminants of cancer care costs between benefit types and care sources withinthe MHS.DOI: 10.1093/milmed/usy052 PMID: 29660010
