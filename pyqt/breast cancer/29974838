In the present study, the Epirubicin -calf thymusDNA interaction was investigated by using spectroscopic, fluorimetric andmolecular docking methods. Water-soluble quantum dots (QDs) with nanometricparticle size fabricated and characterized by transmission electron microscopeand photon correlation spectroscopy. The binding constant value and the freeenergy change for this interaction were obtained to be 3.00Ã—106 M-1 and -42.26 kJmol-1, using the spectroscopic method and docking investigations, respectively.Additionally, fluorescent thioglycolic acid-capped CdTe QDs were used forinvestigation of EPI and DNA interaction. Epirubicin as a quencher quenched thefluorescence of CdTe QDs after electrostatic adsorption on the surface of QDs.With the addition of DNA, EPI will be desorbed from the surface of CdTe QDs,inserted into the DNA. Subsequently, fluorescence changes of QDs were used forcalculation of binding constant value, which was in good agreement with thatobtained by the spectroscopic method. By the comparison of the achieved results, the intercalation mode of interaction between Epirubicin and DNA proved.PMID: 29974838
