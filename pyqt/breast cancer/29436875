Copolymer synthesiswas proven by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance(1H-NMR). The SMA-PAEEI-PEG micelles loaded with DTX were prepared and theircritical micelle concentration (CMC), zeta potential, particle size, entrapmentefficiency, and their release efficiency were studied. MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 breastcancer cells were used to evaluate the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of themicelles. The antitumor activity of the DTX-loaded nanomicelles was measured inBalb/c mice.RESULTS: The FTIR and HNMR spectroscopy confirmed successful conjugation of SMAand PAEEI-PEG. The drug loading efficiency was in the range of 34.01-72.75% anddrug release lasted for 120 h. The CMC value of the micelles was affected by the SMA/PAEEI-PEG ratio and was in the range of 29.85-14.28 µg/ml. The DTX-loadedmicelles showed five times more cytotoxicity than the free drug. The DTX loadedmicelles were more effective in tumor growth suppression in vivo and the animals showed an enhanced rate of survival.CONCLUSION: The results show that the SMA-PAEEI-PEG micelles of DTX couldpotentially provide a suitable parenteral formulation with more stability, highercytotoxicity, and improved antitumor activity.DOI: 10.1080/03639045.2018.1438462 PMID: 29436875
