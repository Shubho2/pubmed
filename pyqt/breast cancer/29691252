Here we report that USP6NL is overexpressed in breast cancer, mainly of the basal-like/integrative cluster 10 subtype.Increased USP6NL levels were accompanied by gene amplification and wereassociated with worse prognosis in the METABRIC dataset, retaining prognosticvalue in multivariable analysis. High levels of USP6NL in breast cancer cellsdelayed endocytosis and degradation of the EGFR, causing chronic AKT (proteinkinase B) activation. In turn, AKT stabilized the glucose transporter GLUT1 atthe plasma membrane, increasing aerobic glycolysis. In agreement, elevated USP6NLsensitized breast cancer cells to glucose deprivation, indicating that theirglycolytic capacity relies on this protein. Depletion of USP6NL acceleratedEGFR/AKT downregulation and GLUT1 degradation, impairing cell proliferationexclusively in breast cancer cells that harbored increased levels of USP6NL.Overall, these findings argue that USP6NL overexpression generates a metabolicrewiring that is essential to foster the glycolytic demand of breast cancer cellsand promote their proliferation.Significance: USP6NL overexpression leads toglycolysis addiction of breast cancer cells and presents a point of metabolicvulnerability for therapeutic targeting in a subset of aggressive basal-likebreast tumors.Graphical Abstract:http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/13/3432/F1.large.jpg CancerRes; 78(13); 3432-44. ©2018 AACR.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-3018 PMID: 29691252
