Metastatic breast cancer patients with atleast three distinct metastatic sites whose tumor had progressed after at leastone line of therapy were randomized to receive 1 or 10 mg/kg of fresolimumab,every 3 weeks for five cycles, with focal radiotherapy to a metastatic site atweek 1 (three doses of 7.5 Gy), that could be repeated to a second lesion at week7. Research bloods were drawn at baseline, week 2, 5, and 15 to isolate PBMCs,plasma, and serum.Results: Twenty-three patients were randomized, median age 57(range 35-77). Seven grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 5 of 11 patients in the1 mg/kg arm and in 2 of 12 patients in the 10 mg/kg arm, respectively. Responsewas limited to three stable disease. At a median follow up of 12 months, 20 of 23patients are deceased. Patients receiving the 10 mg/kg had a significantly highermedian overall survival than those receiving 1 mg/kg fresolimumab dose [hazardratio: 2.73 with 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-7.30; P = 0.039]. The higher dose correlated with improved peripheral blood mononuclear cell counts and astriking boost in the CD8 central memory pool.Conclusions: TGFβ blockade duringradiotherapy was feasible and well tolerated. Patients receiving the higherfresolimumab dose had a favorable systemic immune response and experienced longermedian overall survival than the lower dose group.
