(2)Tissue microarray (TMA) of 74 HR-breast carcinomas treated with adjuvant therapy (77.0% of the patients received anthracycline, 17.6% of the patientsnon-anthracycline-based therapy, and in 5.4% of the cases, no treatment data are available). Interphase FISH technique was applied on pretreatment core biopsies(cohort I) and on TMAs (cohort II) using custom-made dual-labelled FISH probes(LAPTM4B/CEN8q FISH probe Abnova Corp.).RESULTS: In the neoadjuvant cohort in the anthracycline-treated group, weobserved a significant difference (p = 0.029) of average LAPTM4B copy numberbetween the non-responder and pathological complete responder groups (4.1 ± 1.1vs. 2.6 ± 0.1). In the adjuvant setting, the anthracycline-treated group ofmetastatic breast carcinomas was characterized by higher LAPTM4B copy numbercomparing to the non-metastatic ones (p = 0.046). In contrast, in thenon-anthracycline-treated group of patients, we did not find any LAPTM4B genecopy number differences between responder vs. non-responder groups or betweenmetastatic vs. non-metastatic groups.CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the possible role of the LAPTM4B gene inanthracycline resistance in HR- breast cancer. Analyzing LAPTM4B copy numberpattern may support future treatment decision.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3602-z PMID: 29770955
