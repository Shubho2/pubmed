Bone is the primary site of metastasis forseveral cancers-breast and prostate cancers in particular. Efforts to treat bone metastases have been stymied by a lack of models to study the progression,cellular players, and signaling pathways driving bone metastasis. In this review,we examine newly described and classic models of bone metastasis. Through the useof current in vivo, microfluidic, and in silico computational bone metastasismodels we may eventually understand how cells escape the primary tumor and howthese circulating tumor cells then home to and colonize the bone marrow. Further,future models may uncover how cells enter and then escape dormancy to developinto overt metastases. Recreating the metastatic process will lead to thediscovery of therapeutic targets for disrupting and treating bone metastasis.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10060176 PMCID: PMC6024970PMID: 29865211
