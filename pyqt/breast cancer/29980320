Data of the YBT was used to investigate whichfactors are related with worse cosmetic outcome after BCT.METHODS: From 2004 to 2011, 2421 cT1-2N0-2a breast cancer patients wererandomized. CO was scored subjectively by the patient and physician, andobjectively using BCCT.core: at baseline, one and four years after treatment.Associations between potential risk factors for worse cosmetic outcome, based on the objective BCCT.core, were investigated using a proportional odds model.RESULTS: At four years, CO was significantly better in the standard boost groupfor all three scoring methods (satisfied CO ±65% vs 55%). A photon boost, highboost dose, poor cosmesis before radiation therapy, large boost volume andadjuvant chemotherapy significantly deteriorated CO.CONCLUSION: Important risk factors for worse CO were the use of a photon boostinstead of an electron boost, a high boost dose, cosmesis at baseline, adjuvantchemotherapy and boost volume. These results can be used to define strategiesaimed at improving CO.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.radonc.2018.06.020 PMID: 29980320
