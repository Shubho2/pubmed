Thus, the development ofnovel approaches that affect cancer cell-specific metabolic pathways is needed.Since much evidence has shown that tumor cell proliferation and motility arestimulated by glutamate via activation of its receptors, use of antagonists tothese receptors may be the key to control cancer cell progression. Riluzolenoncompetitive metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) antagonist, commonlyused to treat patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), has shown someantineoplastic properties against melanoma, breast and prostate cancer. Yetlittle is known about its molecular mode of action.AIMS: The current study aims at evaluating the abilities of Riluzole to inhibitproliferation of several cancer cell lines, as well as resolve the mechanism ofits action.METHOD: We demonstrated antiproliferative and antimigrative properties ofRiluzole in rhabdomyosarcomamedulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, astrocytoma, glioma, colon cancer, lung cancer, thyroid carcinoma, leukemia, erythroleukemia andmultiple myeloma. Our studies revealed apoptosis induction and G2-M cell cyclearrest in Riluzole treated A549, C6 and HT-29 cells.RESULT: At the molecular level, we found that these cells treated with Riluzolehad a decrease of Cyclin B and an increase of p21 Waf1/Cip1 and p53 expression.We also observed an enhancement of CDK1 and Chk2 phosphorylation. Reportedchanges may suggest the involvement of these proteins in G2-M arrest, observed inflow cytometry analysis. These data indicated the potential use of Riluzole inthe treatment of different types of cancers.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1871520618666180228152713 PMID: 29493465
