Recently, the extract of Euterpe oleracea (açaí), afruit that is widely found in the Amazon region, already showed antitumorigeniceffects in vitro in human breast cancer cell lines. The present study aimed toinvestigate the effect of açaí on breast cancer using a chemically DMBA(7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene) experimental model.METHODS: One day after initiation of treatment with açaí, mammary carcinogenesis was induced in female Wistar rats using a subcutaneous injection of 25 mg/kg ofDMBA in the mammary gland. Forty rats were randomized into two groups: treatedwith 200 mg/kg of either açaí extract or vehicle, via gastric tube for 16consecutive weeks. After treatment, the tumor was collected for macroscopic,histological and immunohistochemical (VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factorreceptor 2 -VEGFR-2, COX-2 and matrix metalloproteinase -MMP-9) analyses;peritoneal fluid was subjected to flow cytometry (F4-80/MAC-2+) and ELISAimmunoassay (VEGF, prostaglandin E2 -PGE2 and interleukin-10 -IL-10). Heart,liver and kidney samples were collected for histological analysis.RESULTS: After 16 weeks of induction, the mammary carcinoma was confirmed bymacroscopic and histological evaluation. Survival analysis indicates that açaíincreased the survival (P = .0002, long-rank test) and reduced the deaths number (P = .0036, Chi-square test). Açaí treatment decreased the number of inflammatorycells and macrophage positive cells (Mac-2 + F4-80+), as well as promoting areduction in immunostaining of VEGF, VEGFR-2 and COX-2. The açaí group alsoexhibited lower concentrations of PGE2, VEGF and IL-10 compared to the control.The histopathological results of the liver and kidneys showed protective effectof açaí, since in the control group, there was an increase in fibrosis, atypical cells and hemorrhagic microenvironment.CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated the antiangiogenic andanti-inflammatory potential of açaí, like due to the decreases of the number ofactivated macrophages, resulting in the inhibition of DMBA carcinogenicity inbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12906-018-2183-z PMCID: PMC5879811PMID: 29609579  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
