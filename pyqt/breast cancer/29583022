In the context of breast cancersurgery, this exploratory study examined the effect of breast surgeon informationprovision on the immediate post-visit outcomes of patients' anxiouspreoccupation, intention to adhere to treatment recommendations, and treatmentplan satisfaction. Participants included 51 newly diagnosed breast cancerpatients receiving care from one breast surgeon at a National CancerInstitute-designated cancer center in the northeastern United States.Participants completed pre- and post-visit questionnaires. Medical interactionswere recorded, transcribed, and analyzed via multidimensional analysis, a method of linguistic analysis that uses exploratory factor analysis to identify howspecific types of words are patterned and work to accomplish communicative goals (Biber, 1988). The multidimensional analysis identified constellations oflanguage used by providers and patients. Although five linguistic dimensionsemerged, one dimension, impersonal information provision, is of unique interestin understanding how providers communicate with patients. Impersonal information provision encompasses the ways in which the provider, using an impersonal tone,discussed the logistics, details, and implications of treatment options.Increased impersonal information provision was associated with patients'decreased anxious preoccupation (β = -.22, t = -2.82, p = .007), increasedtreatment plan satisfaction (β = .36, t = 2.54, p = .012), and increasedintention to adhere to treatment recommendations (β = .34, t = 2.45, p = .018).Findings suggest that specific provider behavior and types of informationprovided have unique and important effects on patients' health outcomes.DOI: 10.1080/10410236.2018.1454254 PMID: 29583022
