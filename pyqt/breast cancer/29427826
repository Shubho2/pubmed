Interleukin-6 is highly involved inphysiopathology of TA. Many reports showed efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ) inrefractory TA cases. We report four cases and an updated literature review on theTCZ efficacy and safety in patients with TA.METHODS: Patients with TA defined by ACR 1990 criteria were included. Clinical,biological and imaging data were retrospectively reported. Disease activity wasanalyzed before TCZ and during the follow-up. Medline database was searched forsystematic literature review.RESULTS: One hundred and five patients (median age 28years [22-38]) wereincluded, mostly refractory cases (76 patients, 72%). Median TCZ duration was12months [6-20]. Among 105 patients, 90 patients (85.7%) had an initial clinical response within three months [3-6] and 43/66 patients (65.2%) had a radiological improvement. Only seven patients (9%) showed relapse on therapy. Corticosteroiddose reduction was obtained in 75/83 patients (90.4%). Relapse after TCZdiscontinuation was observed in six patients (46%), with a median time of fivemonths [2-9]. Twenty-four side-effects were noted in 18 patients (18%), with TCZ interruption in seven cases (7%): 10 infections, five cytopenia, six hepatitis,one pancreatitis, one cutaneous rash and one breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: This review confirms that TCZ is safe and effective in refractorycases of TA and TCZ is a corticosteroid-sparing therapy in patients with orwithout previous TNFα blockers therapy. However relapses after TCZdiscontinuation are frequent.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.autrev.2017.11.026 PMID: 29427826  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
