Referralpathology was performed, and active follow-up was conducted. Adjusted coxregression analysis (hazard ratio [HR]) was performed.RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 45 (16-83) years; 57% of the patientspresented with cT3/4 tumors, 71% with clinically positive lymph nodes, 21% withHER2-overexpression (Dako3+) and 68% with grade 3 tumors. Estrogen and/orprogesterone receptor expressions were present in 66% and triple-negative diseasein 25%. The estimated 1- and 2-year overall survival probability rates were 78and 53%, respectively. The 2-year survival for patients with clinically positive lymph nodes was 44% compared to 73% for patients with lymph node-negative disease(HR 2.44; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.19-5.02). The corresponding 2-yearsurvival for patients with cT4 tumors was 25% versus 68% for patients with cT1-2 tumors (cT1-3 vs. cT4 HR 3.86; 95% CI 1.82-13.63). The 2-year survival forpatients with hormone receptor-negative disease was 40% compared to 59% forpatients with hormone receptor-positive disease (HR 1.92; 95% CI 1.06-3.47).CONCLUSION: The majority of breast cancer patients treated with surgery in rural parts of western Ethiopia are diagnosed at advanced stage and have hormonereceptor-positive disease. Nearly half of the patients die within 2 years. These findings underscore the need for provision of adjuvant hormonal therapy and forthe establishment of pathology service including hormone receptor testing.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4724-z PMID: 29479644
