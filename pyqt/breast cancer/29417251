Eightradiologists read once with (CAD-ABUS) and once without CAD (ABUS) with > 8 weeksbetween reading sessions. Readers provided a BI-RADS score and a level ofsuspiciousness (0-100). RT, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and area under thecurve (AUC) were compared.RESULTS: Average RT was significantly shorter using CAD-ABUS (133.4 s/case, 95%CI 129.2-137.6) compared with ABUS (158.3 s/case, 95% CI 153.0-163.3) (p <0.001). Sensitivity was 0.84 for CAD-ABUS (95% CI 0.79-0.89) and ABUS (95% CI0.78-0.88) (p = 0.90). Three out of eight readers showed significantly higherspecificity using CAD. Pooled specificity (0.71, 95% CI 0.68-0.75 vs. 0.67, 95%CI 0.64-0.70, p = 0.08) and PPV (0.50, 95% CI 0.45-0.55 vs. 0.44, 95% CI0.39-0.49, p = 0.07) were higher in CAD-ABUS vs. ABUS, respectively, albeit notsignificantly. Pooled AUC for CAD-ABUS was comparable with ABUS (0.82 vs. 0.83, p= 0.53, respectively).CONCLUSION: CAD software for ABUS may decrease the time needed to screen forbreast cancer without compromising the screening performance of radiologists.KEY POINTS: • ABUS with CAD software may speed up reading time withoutcompromising radiologists' accuracy. • CAD software for ABUS might preventnon-detection of malignant breast lesions by radiologists. • Radiologists readingABUS with CAD software might improve their specificity without losingsensitivity.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-017-5280-3 PMCID: PMC5986849PMID: 29417251
