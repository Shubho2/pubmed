MATERIALAND METHODS This case-control study included 242 breast cancer patients and 252normal people without disease. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the CD44gene in the 2 groups were genotyped by PCR-LDR method. The OR and its 95% CI was calculated by chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. The construction of haplotypes and their interaction analysis with relevant factors were carriedout by SHEsis and SNPStats online. RESULTS The genotype distribution of CC andCT, CC and CC+CT, and CC+CT and TT in rs13347 showed a significant differencebetween cases and controls, and the difference in distribution of alleles C and Twas statistically significant. The genotype and alleles distribution of rs4756195and rs8193 showed no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). Thehaplotypes distribution of CAC, CGT, TAC, and TGT showed a significant differencebetween the 2 groups (P<0.05). The results of analysis of haplotypes and theirinteractions with relevant factors showed that breast cancer risk in thePR-negative group was significantly higher than that in the PR-positive group(P=0.016). We found an interaction between haplotypes and PR status. CONCLUSIONS The genotypes CT, CT+TT, TT, and allele T in rs13347 may be risk factors forbreast cancer. The haplotype CAC may be a protective factor against breastcancer, and CGT, TAC, and TGT may be risk factors for breast cancer. The PRstatus interacts with CD44 gene SNP.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.907422 PMCID: PMC5973502PMID: 29748526
