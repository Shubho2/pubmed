This has drawn our interest in the development of a bioinspired polypeptide- mediated method to design calcium carbonatemicrospheres loaded with tetracycline (CaCO3-TC) with an aim to explore its safe application in cancer therapeutics. Its therapeutic application in cancerpatients essentially demands its safety information on the normal cells. Hereinour study presents the in vitro genetic toxicological information on CaCO3-TCusing noncancerous mammalian CHO cells in comparison to bare TC at threedifferent concentrations (100, 200, and 300 Î¼M) selected based on thecytotoxicity data (MTT). Assessment of various end points like chromosomeaberrations, micronucleus, mitotic index and effects on cell cycle distributionafter 24 h post-treatment demonstrates a significant reduction in clastogenic ( P< 0.001), aneugenic potential ( P < 0.05), and nonmitotoxic nature of CaCO3-TCthan that of bare TC. Noticeably, as inferred from the FACS analysis on cancercells, G2/M phase accumulation in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), and at G1phase in cervical cancer cells (HeLa) reveal its potential anticancer property.On the other hand, the genotoxicity studies illustrate protective effects ofCaCO3-TC on noncancerous cells. While the pH-dependent dissolution property ofthe CaCO3 matrix encasing tetracycline results in higher toxicity on cancercells, the near neutral pH in the case of normal cells prevents completedissolution of CaCO3 thereby not allowing the encapsulated TC to adequatelyinteract with the cells. Therefore, thus assembled CaCO3 spheres not only providea way for facile encapsulation of tetracycline under mild conditions but alsoresult in an effective matrix for differential toxicity toward normal and cancer cells justifying its clinical development as a novel target-specific drug intherapeutic applications for metastatic cancers.DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.8b00131 PMID: 29923707
