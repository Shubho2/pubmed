The drugresistance phenotype is also associated with an enhancement of cancer stemcell-like (CSC) characteristics. Thus, inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins has been proposed as a possible antineoplastic strategy, and BCL-2inhibitors are currently being clinically trailed in patients with leukemia,lymphoma or non-small cell lung cancer. However, the effects of BCL-2 inhibitors on drug resistant breast cancer have not yet been elucidated. In the presentstudy, the effect of sabutoclax, a pan-active BCL-2 protein family antagonist, ontwo chemoresistant breast cancer cell lines was assessed. We found thatsabutoclax showed a significant cytotoxic activity on chemoresistant breastcancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. When chemotherapeutic agents werecombined with sabutoclax, strong synergistic antiproliferative effects wereobserved. Sabutoclax induced the blockage of BCL-2, MCL-1, BCL-xL and BFL-1,which in turn led to caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 activation and modulation of Bax, Bim, PUMA and survivin expression. Furthermore, sabutoclax effectively eliminatedthe CSC subpopulation and reduced sphere formation of drug-resistant cellsthrough down-regulation of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. A similar effect wasobserved in a small panel of nine breast tumors ex vivo. Our findings indicatethat sabutoclax partially overcomes the drug resistance phenotype of breastcancer cells by reactivation of apoptosis, mediated by the inhibition of several anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, and eliminates CSCs by abolition of theIL-6/STAT3 pathway. This offers a strong rationale to explore the therapeuticstrategy of using sabutoclax alone or in combination forchemotherapy-nonresponsive breast cancer patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
