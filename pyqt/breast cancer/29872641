Sinceit is not feasible to conduct adequate pairwise comparative trials of all thesetherapeutic options, network meta-analysis offers an opportunity for moredetailed inference for evidence-based therapy.Methods: Phase II/III randomized clinical trials comparing two or more different (neo)adjuvant treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer patients were included. Relative treatment effects were pooled in two separate network meta-analyses for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).Results: 17 clinical trials met our eligibility criteria. Two different networks of trials were created based on the availability of the outcomes: OS network (15 trials: 37,837 patients); and DFS network (17 trials: 40,992 patients). Twostudies-the ExteNET and the NeoSphere trials-were included only in this DFSnetwork because OS data have not yet been reported. The concept of the dualanti-HER2 blockade proved to be the best option in terms of OS and DFS.Chemotherapy (CT) plus trastuzumab (T) and lapatinib (L) and CT + T + Pertuzumab (P) are probably the best treatment options in terms of OS, with 62.47% and22.06%, respectively. In the DFS network, CT + T + Neratinib (N) was the besttreatment option with 50.55%, followed by CT + T + P (26.59%) and CT + T + L(20.62%).Conclusion: This network meta-analysis suggests that dual anti-HER2 blockade withtrastuzumab plus either lapatinib or pertuzumab are probably the best treatmentoptions in the (neo)adjuvant setting for HER2-positive breast cancer patients in terms of OS gain. Mature OS results are still expected for the Aphinity trial andfor the sequential use of trastuzumab followed by neratinib, the treatment thatshowed the best performance in terms of DFS in our analysis.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00156 PMCID: PMC5972314PMID: 29872641
