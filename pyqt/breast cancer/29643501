In addition to their use in research,advocacy, and awareness campaigns, social media offer vast opportunities foreducation and networking for patients with prostate cancer and health-careprofessionals, and many educational resources and support networks are available to patients with prostate cancer and their caregivers. Despite the considerablepotential for social media to be employed in the field of prostate cancer,concerns remain - particularly regarding the maintenance of patientconfidentiality, variable information quality, and possible financial conflictsof interest. A number of professional societies have, therefore, issued guidance regarding social media use in medicine.
