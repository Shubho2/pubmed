The fight againstbreast cancer has also become a major task for medical workers. MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are often aberrantly expressed in diverse cancers and are involved inprogression and metastasis. Many studies have found that miRNAs can act asoncogenes or as tumor suppressor genes. Here, we show that miR-433 issignificantly decreased in breast cancer cells. In addition, we demonstrate theeffects of miR-433 on breast cancer cell apoptosis, migration and proliferationin an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of action of miR-433. Moreover, Rap1awas predicted to be a potential target of miR-433 using bioinformatic approaches,and we found that the expression of Rap1a is inversely correlated with the level of miR-433. Further studies through overexpression and knockdown of Rap1aconfirmed that Rap1a, as a direct target gene of miR-433, contributes to thefunctions of miR-433. In addition, we found that Rap1a activates the MAPKsignaling pathway, which can contribute to cell migration and proliferation andcan inhibit apoptosis. Overall, these findings highlight miR-433 as a tumorsuppressor gene in the regulation of the progression and metastatic potential of breast cancer and may benefit the future development of therapies targetingmiR-433 in breast cancer.DOI: 10.7150/ijbs.24223 PMCID: PMC6001658PMID: 29904277
