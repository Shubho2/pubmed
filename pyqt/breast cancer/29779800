This study compares treatment patterns and survival ofolder women diagnosed with breast cancer between a Dutch and a Britishobservational cohort.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women aged 70 years and older diagnosed with breast cancerafter 1990 with a T0-T2 tumor stage and no evidence of metastatic disease wereincluded from a population-based cohort in the Netherlands and a Britishhospital-based cohort in Nottingham. Main outcomes were proportions of local and systemic treatment, ten-year overall survival and ten-year relative survival for each cohort.RESULTS: 1439 patients from Nottingham and 2180 patients from the Netherlandswere included. Median follow-up was 12.4 years (IQR 11.0-14.0) in the FOCUScohort and 6.4 years (IQR 6.2-6.8) in the Nottingham cohort. British patientswere more likely to receive primary endocrine therapy (50.0% vs 7.5%, P < 0.001),and less likely to be managed with mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery (47.8%vs 90.5%, P < 0.001). Ten-years overall survival was 39.4% (95% CI 37.4-41.6%) inthe FOCUS cohort and 34.3% (95% CI 30.7-38.3) in the Nottingham cohort (adjusted HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87-1.08, P = 0.559). Ten-year relative survival was 82.5% (95% CI 75.6-90.1) in the FOCUS cohort and 77.6% (95% CI 66.4-90.7) in the Nottingham cohort (adjusted relative excess risk 1.67, 95% CI 1.21-2.29, P = 0.002).CONCLUSION: Patients in the Nottingham cohort were more likely to receive primaryendocrine therapy and had worse relative survival compared to the Dutch cohort.These findings encourage further research to equalize survival rates of breastcancer throughout Europe.Copyright © 2018.
