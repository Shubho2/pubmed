A phase I dose escalation trial of GMCI followed by chemotherapywas conducted in patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE). AdV-tk wasadministered intrapleurally (IP) in three cohorts at a dose of 1 × 1012 to 1013vector particles. Primary endpoint was safety; secondary endpoints includedresponse rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Nineteen patientswere enrolled: median age 67 years; 14 with malignant mesothelioma, 4non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 1 breast cancer. There were no doselimiting toxicities. All 3 patients in cohort 2 experienced transient cytokinerelease syndrome (CRS). Addition of celecoxib in cohort 3 reduced the incidenceand severity of CRS (none > grade 2). Three patients are alive (23-33 monthsafter GMCI), and 3 of 4 NSCLC patients had prolonged disease stabilization; oneis alive 29 months after GMCI, 3.6 years after initial diagnosis. GMCI was safeand well tolerated in combination with chemotherapy in patients with MPE andshowed encouraging response. Further studies are warranted to determine efficacy.Copyright © 2018 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy. Published byElsevier Inc.
