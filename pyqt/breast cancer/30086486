Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis wasperformed to examine the associations between the DII and the risks of breast andprostate cancer among men and women.METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed and EMBASEdatabases up to March 2018. Data were available from 13 studies; of these, fourstudies used a prospective cohort design and nine studies were case-controlstudies. A total of 231 947 individuals from nine countries were included inthese studies for the meta-analysis. The results were pooled using arandom-effects model.RESULTS: A pooled, adjusted odds ratio (OR) analysis indicated that there was adirect relationship between the highest versus lowest DII scores and prostatecancer risk in men (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.04-1.57) but not the breast cancer risk(BCR) in women (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.96-2.33). In the subgroup analyses, a moresignificant association between DII score and increased BCR was noted inpremenopausal (OR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.06-3.00) than in postmenopausal women (OR:1.52; 95% CI: 0.89-2.16). When the results were stratified by body mass index, a positive association was observed between DII score and increased BCR in women(OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.48-2.18). Furthermore, there was no significant association between the highest versus lowest DII score and BCR among women who receivedhormone therapy (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 0.93-1.64).CONCLUSIONS: Men and premenopausal women who exhibit higher DII scores haveincreased prostate and breast cancer incidence risks, respectively. Moreover,body mass index had positive associations with the relationship between DII scoreand BCR in women. Further prospective cohort studies with longer follow-upperiods are needed to support this possible association between DII score andcancer incidence.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
