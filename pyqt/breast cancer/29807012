Electronic address:gxrxwk@163.com.Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), class III histone deacetylase, plays an important character incell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, energy metabolism and DNA repair. Inrecent years, researchers have attached increasing attention on the role of SIRT1in tumorigenesis, development and drug resistance. The effect of SIRT1 on breast cancer is still controversial and its exact role remains to be elucidated. In thepresent study, we investigated the significant role of SIRT1 in breast cancer by exploring the effect of SIRT1 on DNA polymerase delta1 (POLD1), the gene codingfor DNA polymerase δ catalytic subunit p125. Immunohistochemistry showed that theprotein expression level of SIRT1 was higher in breast cancer tissues relative toadjacent normal tissues. Knockdown of SIRT1 by shRNA decreased the proliferation,migration, and invasion of human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, while theoverexpression of SIRT1 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion ofMCF-7 cells. Clinically, the immunohistochemistry results revealed that theexpression of SIRT1 was positively correlated with p125. Further analysisdemonstrated that silencing of SIRT1 increased the expression of p53, while theexpression level of POLD1/p125 decreased, and the result by overexpressing SIRT1 was opposite. Collectively, these data suggest that SIRT1 is an oncogenic factor in breast cancer cells and can be involved in the progression of breast cancer byinhibiting p53 and activating POLD1. Our finding provides new insights into themechanisms of breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.164 PMID: 29807012
