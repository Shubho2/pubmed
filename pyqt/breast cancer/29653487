Electronic address: wuzhenqian12741@163.com.Solute carrier family 34 member 2 (SLC34A2) is a well-known sodium-dependentphosphate transporter that has recently been linked to cancer development.However, its specific oncogenic role remains controversial in numerous humanmalignancies, and is currently unknown in colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, in this study we firstly used Oncomine database to determine its expression incancer tissues and found it is overexpressed in thyroid, ovarian and renalcancer, while it is opposite in lung, breast and pancreas cancer. Using qRT-PCRand western blot, we then demonstrated its overexpression in CRC tissues ascompared with adjacent normal tissues (n = 20). In a retrospective cohortenrolling 190 CRC patients, we proved its expression was significantly correlatedwith N stage. Furthermore, high SLC34A2 expression is associated with higherpostoperative metastasis rate and serves as an independent adverse factoraffecting patient prognosis. In subgroup analysis, SLC34A2 expression couldstratify the patient prognosis in stage II and III CRC, but failed in stage IVCRC. In cellular assays in vitro, knockdown of SLC34A2 dramatically inhibited theproliferation and colony formation, induced the apoptosis and arrests the cellcycle progression of HCT-116 CRC cells. In cellular assays in vivo, knockdown of SLC34A2 significantly inhibited the growth of xenografts, decreasing Ki-67 andproliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression and increasing apoptosisrate. Taken together, our study indicates SLC34A2 plays a crucial promoting role in CRC development and therefore has great potential to be further developed as areliable biomarker for CRC diagnosis and treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
