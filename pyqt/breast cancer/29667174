Whether a prior cancer diagnosis interferes with outcome is unknown. We conducted apan-cancer analysis to determine the impact of prior cancer history for patients newly diagnosed with cancer. We identified 20 types of primary solid tumorsbetween 2004 and 2008 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Resultsdatabase. Demographic and clinicopathologic variables were compared by χ2 testand t-test as appropriate. The propensity score-adjusted Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the impact of prior cancer on overall survival (OS). Among 1,557,663 eligible patients, 261,474 (16.79%) hada history of prior cancer. More than 65% of prior cancers were diagnosed within 5years. We classified 20 cancer sites into two groups (PCI and PCS) according tothe different impacts of prior cancer on OS. PCI patients with a prior cancerhistory, which involved the colon and rectum, bone and soft tissues, melanoma,breast, cervix uteri, corpus and uterus, prostate, urinary bladder, kidney andrenal pelvis, eye and orbits, thyroid, had inferior OS. The PCS patients(nasopharynx, esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, lung, ovary andbrain) with a prior cancer history showed similar OS to that of patients without prior cancer. Our pan-cancer study presents the landscape for the survival impactof prior cancer across 20 cancer types. Compared to the patients without priorcancer, the PCI group had inferior OS, while the PCS group had similar OS.Further studies are still needed.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31543 PMID: 29667174
