Gynecomastia is the most common disease of the male breast. Wereport a 63-year-old male patient with EPC accompanied by gynecomastia that wasdiagnosed and treated at our breast center. Mammography showed an oval-shapeddense mass with circumscribed margins on the ground of nodular gynecomastia. Onultrasonographic exam, we saw a well-circumscribed complex mass with a solidcomponent which was vascular on Doppler ultrasonography. Magnetic resonanceimaging revealed a complex cystic mass containing solid components. Dynamicimages showed enhancement of the cystic mass wall and mural components. Tumorstage was evaluated as T2N0. The lesion's histologic examination andimmunohistochemical analysis by showing no myoepithelial layer revealed anencapsulated papillary carcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case reportwhich describes MR imaging findings of male breast encapsulated papillary cancer.DOI: 10.5152/ejbh.2018.3761 PMCID: PMC5939977PMID: 29774323
