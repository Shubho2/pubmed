Using an integrative transcriptomic analysisof prostate cancer cell lines and tissues, we identified ARLNC1 (AR-regulatedlong noncoding RNA 1) as an important long noncoding RNA that is stronglyassociated with AR signaling in prostate cancer progression. Not only was ARLNC1 induced by the AR protein, but ARLNC1 stabilized the AR transcript via RNA-RNAinteraction. ARLNC1 knockdown suppressed AR expression, global AR signaling andprostate cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these data support arole for ARLNC1 in maintaining a positive feedback loop that potentiates ARsignaling during prostate cancer progression and identify ARLNC1 as a noveltherapeutic target.DOI: 10.1038/s41588-018-0120-1 PMCID: PMC5980762 [Available on 2018-11-28]PMID: 29808028
