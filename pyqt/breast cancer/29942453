Ionizing radiation (IR) is known toinduce Sestrin gene expression in breast cancer cells. However, the response ofSestrin to IR has not been reported in PC3 prostate cancer cells.Materials and Methods: Sestrin2 expression in prostate cancer cell lines (PC3,LNCaP clone FGC, and DU145) was detected by Western blot and real-time PCR. Cell counting kit (CCK-8) was used to detect cellular proliferation. Theradiosensitivity of PC3 cells was detected by clonogenic assay.Results: Sestrin2 expression in prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, LNCaP clone FGC,and DU145) is low. In vitro assays indicated that over-expressing Sestrin2 inhuman prostate cancer PC3 inhibited tumor proliferation. In addition, elevatedSestrin2 expression sensitized PC3 cells to IR.Conclusion: We determined Sestrin2 may function as a tumor suppressor throughrepressing proliferation, mediating sensitization to IR in PC3 cells.DOI: 10.22038/IJBMS.2018.18283.4923 PMCID: PMC6015252PMID: 29942453
