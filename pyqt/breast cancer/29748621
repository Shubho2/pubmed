Frequent mutations (10-40%) in the ligand-binding domain (LBD)codons in the gene encoding ERα (ESR1) have been identified, resulting inligand-independent, constitutively active receptors. In addition, ESR1chromosomal translocations can occur, resulting in fusion proteins that lack the LBD and are entirely unresponsive to all endocrine treatments. Thus, identifying coactivators that bind to these mutant ERα proteins may offer new therapeutictargets for endocrine-resistant cancer. To define coactivator candidate targets, a proteomics approach was performed profiling proteins recruited to the two most common ERα LBD mutants, Y537S and D538G, and an ESR1-YAP1 fusion protein. Thesemutants displayed enhanced coactivator interactions as compared to unligandedwild-type ERα. Inhibition of these coactivators decreased the ability of ESR1mutants to activate transcription and promote breast cancer growth in vitro andin vivo. Thus, we have identified specific coactivators that may be useful astargets for endocrine-resistant breast cancers.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0284-2 PMID: 29748621
