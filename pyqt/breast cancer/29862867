The cytotoxic activity of these complexesagainst MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines was determined using theMTT assay. Evaluation of apoptosis induction was done with the AnnexinV-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide assay. In addition, using a flowcytometer, we determined the influence of test compounds on the cell cycle andcaspase-3, -8, and -9 activity. The obtained results of caspase activity wereconfirmed by cell imaging. Moreover, using the flow cytometer, the effects of thetest compounds on mitochondrial potential change were assessed. The test results showed that novel pyrazole-platinum(II) complexes exhibited strongeranti-proliferative activity against two breast cancer cell lines than referencecisplatin. Compounds PtPz1, PtPz2, and PtPz3 with methyl substituents at thepyrazole ring showed stronger activity than pyrazole or ethylpyrazole containing complexes. Studies have shown that inhibition of cell survival occurs byarresting the G1 cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. Our analysis associated with the response of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells to treatment with PtPz1-PtPz6 showedthat it leads the cells through the external and intrinsic (mitochondrial)apoptotic pathway via indirect DNA damage.DOI: 10.1080/14756366.2018.1471687 PMCID: PMC6009892PMID: 29862867  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
