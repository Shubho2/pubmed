In 2012, OPS has been introduced as the standard treatmentfor a selected group of patients at the National Cancer Institute of Peru (INEN).The aim of this study is to describe our findings.Methods: This is a retrospective and descriptive study that identifieddemographics, tumour-pathologic features and includes patients solely treatedsince diagnosis until late follow-up at INEN. These OPS patients were identified from the conservative treatment patients group by review of medical charts andcreation of a database for periods December 2005 through December 2015.Results: A total of 146 patients were ruled in by the inclusion criteria. Allpatients were Peruvian females, 56.2% being 51 or older. 93.8% had core biopsydiagnosis of breast cancer and 52.1% located at the upper outer quadrant. 79.5%patients had upfront OPS and the round block (43.2%) and reduction/mastopexy(23.3%) were the most used techniques. pT2 was the most frequent size (54.7%). Weachieved negative margins in 134 patients (93.2%) in a single procedure. Of 29patients, who had neoadjuvant treatment, 11 achieved pCR. Only 5.5% had pN2 orhigher. 95.2% received complimentary external beam radiotherapy.Conclusions: OPS has proven to be a reliable surgical option, both for aesthetic and oncologic outcomes. Important points for achieving these results are breastsurgeons having properly trained under the OPS philosophy and knowing thepatients' characteristics for correct technique selection.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.815 PMCID: PMC5880228PMID: 29662528
