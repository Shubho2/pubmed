Here, we report a dominantly inherited 5' UTR variant associatedwith epigenetic BRCA1 silencing due to promoter hypermethylation in two families affected by breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 promoter methylation of ten CpGdinucleotides in families who are affected by breast and/or ovarian cancer but donot have germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants was assessed bypyrosequencing and clonal bisulfite sequencing. RNA and DNA sequencing of BRCA1from lymphocytes was undertaken to establish allelic expression and the presence of germline variants. BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was identified in 2 of 49families in which multiple women are affected by grade 3 breast cancer orhigh-grade serous ovarian cancer. Soma-wide BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation wasconfirmed in blood, buccal mucosa, and hair follicles. Pyrosequencing showed thatDNA was ∼50% methylated, consistent with the silencing of one allele, which wasconfirmed by clonal bisulfite sequencing. RNA sequencing revealed the allelicloss of BRCA1 expression in both families and that this loss of expressionsegregated with the heterozygous variant c.-107A>T in the BRCA1 5' UTR. Ourresults establish a mechanism whereby familial breast and ovarian cancer iscaused by an in cis 5' UTR variant associated with epigenetic silencing of theBRCA1 promoter in two independent families. We propose that methylation analyses be undertaken to establish the frequency of this mechanism in families affectedby early-onset breast and/or ovarian cancer without a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenicvariant.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
