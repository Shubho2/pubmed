Thus, theidentification of reliable and noninvasive biomarkers for predicting ICBresponsiveness is an urgent unmet need. Here, we show that ICB increased tumorvessel perfusion in treatment-sensitive EO771 and MMTV-PyVT breast tumor as well as CT26 and MCA38 colon tumor models, but not in treatment-resistant MCaP0008 and4T1 breast tumor models. In the sensitive tumor models, the ability ofanti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 or anti-programmed cell death 1 therapy to increase vessel perfusion strongly correlated with its antitumorefficacy. Moreover, globally enhanced tumor vessel perfusion could be detected byDoppler ultrasonography before changes in tumor size, which predicted finaltherapeutic efficacy with more than 90% sensitivity and specificity.Mechanistically, CD8+ T cell depletion, IFN-γ neutralization, or implantation of tumors in IFN-γ receptor knockout mice abrogated the vessel perfusion enhancementand antitumor effects of ICB. These results demonstrated that ICB increasedvessel perfusion by promoting CD8+ T cell accumulation and IFN-γ production,indicating that increased vessel perfusion reflects the successful activation of antitumor T cell immunity by ICB. Our findings suggest that vessel perfusion can be used as a novel noninvasive indicator for predicting ICB responsiveness.DOI: 10.1172/JCI96582 PMCID: PMC5957454PMID: 29664018
