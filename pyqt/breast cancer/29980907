This longitudinal substudy aimed to prospectively assess arm measurements and symptomsfollowing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and axillary dissection in the ACOSOG/AllianceZ1071 trial to characterize the optimal approach to define lymphedema.METHODS: Z1071 enrolled patients with cT0-4, N1-2, M0 disease treated withneoadjuvant chemotherapy. All patients underwent axillary dissection. Bilaterallimb volumes, circumferences, and related symptoms were assessed pre-surgery,1-2 weeks post-surgery, and semiannually for 36 months. Lymphedema definitionsincluded volume increase ≥ 10% or limb circumference increase ≥ 2 cm. Symptomswere assessed by the Lymphedema Breast Cancer Questionnaire.RESULTS: In 488 evaluable patients, lymphedema incidence at 3 years by≥ 10%-volume-increase was 60.3% (95% CI 55.0-66.2%) and by ≥ 2 cm-circumferenceincrease was 75.4% (95% CI 70.8-80.2%). Symptoms of arm swelling and heavinessdecreased from post-surgery for the first 18 months and then were relativelystable. The 3-year cumulative incidence of arm swelling and heaviness was 26.0%(95% CI 21.7-31.1%) and 30.9% (95% CI 26.3-36.3%), respectively. There waslimited agreement between the two measurements (kappa 0.27) and between symptoms and measurements (kappa coefficients ranging from 0.05-0.09).CONCLUSIONS: Lymphedema incidence by limb volume and circumference graduallyincreased over 36 months post-surgery, whereas lymphedema symptoms were muchlower. These findings underscore the importance of prospective surveillance andevaluation of both limb measurements and symptom assessment. Lymphedema incidencerates varied by definition. We recommend that ≥ 10% volume change criterion beused for lymphedema evaluation for referral for specialist care.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00881361.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4334-7 PMID: 29980907
