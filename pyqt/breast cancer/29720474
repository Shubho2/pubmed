Hence, newmolecular targets for therapeutic intervention are necessary. Analyses of panels of human or mouse cancer lines derived from the same individual that differ intheir cellular phenotypes but not in genetic background have been instrumental indefining the molecular players that drive the various hallmarks of cancer. Todetermine the molecular regulators of metastasis in TNBC, we completed a rigorousin vitro and in vivo characterisation of four populations of the MDA-MB-231 humanbreast cancer line ranging in aggressiveness from non-metastatic to spontaneouslymetastatic to lung, liver, spleen and lymph node. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analyses and genome-wide mRNA expression profiles of tumour cellsisolated from orthotopic mammary xenografts were compared between the four lines to define both cell autonomous pathways and genes associated with metastaticproclivity. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated an unexpectedassociation between both ribosome biogenesis and mRNA metabolism and metastaticcapacity. Differentially expressed genes or families of related genes wereallocated to one of four categories, associated with either metastatic initiation(e.g. CTSC, ENG, BMP2), metastatic virulence (e.g. ADAMTS1, TIE1), metastaticsuppression (e.g. CST1, CST2, CST4, CST6, SCNNA1, BMP4) or metastatic avirulence (e.g. CD74). Collectively, this model system based on MDA-MB-231 cells should be useful for the assessment of gene function in the metastatic cascade and also forthe testing of novel experimental therapeutics for the treatment of TNBC.Thisarticle has an associated First Person interview with the first author of thepaper.Â© 2018.
