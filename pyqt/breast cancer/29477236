[Epub ahead of print]Initialization of active contours for segmentation of breast cancer via fusion ofultrasound, Doppler, and elasticity images.Keatmanee C(1), Chaumrattanakul U(2), Kotani K(3), Makhanov SS(4).Author information: (1)Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thammasat University, PathumThani, Thailand; Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Ishikawa,Japan.(2)Department of Radiology, Thammasat University, Pathum Thani, Thailand.(3)Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Ishikawa, Japan.(4)Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thammasat University, PathumThani, Thailand. Electronic address: makhanov@siit.tu.ac.th.Active contours (snakes) are an efficient method for segmentation of ultrasound(US) images of breast cancer. However, the method produces inaccurate results if the seeds are initialized improperly (far from the true boundaries and close tothe false boundaries). Therefore, we propose a novel initialization method based on the fusion of a conventional US image with elasticity and Doppler images. The proposed fusion method (FM) has been tested against four state-of-the-artinitialization methods on 90 ultrasound images from a database collected by theThammasat University Hospital of Thailand. The ground truth was hand-drawn bythree leading radiologists of the hospital. The reference methods are: center of divergence (CoD), force field segmentation (FFS), Poisson Inverse Gradient VectorFlow (PIG), and quasi-automated initialization (QAI). A variety of numericaltests proves the advantages of the FM. For the raw US images, the percentage ofcorrectly initialized contours is: FM-94.2%, CoD-0%, FFS-0%, PIG-26.7%,QAI-42.2%. The percentage of correctly segmented tumors is FM-84.4%, CoD-0%,FFS-0%, PIG-16.67%, QAI-22.44%. For reduced field of view US images, thepercentage of correctly initialized contours is: FM-94.2%, CoD-0%, FFS-0%,PIG-65.6%, QAI-67.8%. The correctly segmented tumors are FM-88.9%, CoD-0%,FFS-0%, PIG-48.9%, QAI-44.5%. The accuracy, in terms of the average Hausdorffdistance, is respectively 2.29 pixels, 33.81, 34.71, 7.7, and 8.4, whereas interms of the Jaccard index, it is 0.9, 0.18, 0.19, 0.63, and 0.48.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.
