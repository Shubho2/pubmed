China.Evidence indicates that high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma arises from thefallopian tube, rather than ovarian surface epithelium. This is termed the 'tubalorigin' theory. The aim of the present study was to compare the immunophenotypeand gene expression profiling among high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) and ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) based ontubal origin theory, and identify the differential genes associated with ovarian carcinogenesis. A total of 61 cases of fresh tissue samples including 21 cases ofHGSOC, 20 cases of OSE, and 20 cases of FTE were obtained following surgicalresection. Immunostaining was performed to detect the expression of PAX8, whichhas been considered as a potential immunophenotype marker of MÃ¼llerian origin.Illumina BeadChip was applied for gene expression profiling. Reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed toconfirm the differential expression of candidate genes between HGSOC and FTE. Theresults of the present study demonstrated that PAX8 was highly expressed in HGSOC(19/21, 90.4%) and FTE (20/20, 100%), but not in OSE (3/20, 14.3%). A dendrogram generated by cluster analysis indicated a higher similarity of gene expressionprofile between HGSOC and FTE than OSE. A total of 2,412 differentially expressedgenes were identified (absolute fold change >2) between HGSOC and FTE, including 822 upregulated genes in cancer and 1,590 downregulated genes. S100 calciumbinding protein P, Ras-interacting protein 1, Wnt family member 5A,tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2, Dickkopf Wnt signaling pathwayinhibitor 3 and tumor suppressor candidate 3 genes were identified as candidatemarkers, of which the differential gene expression in HGSOC and FTE was confirmedby RT-qPCR (P<0.05). The results indicate the presence of a greater similarity inthe immunophenotype and gene expression profile of HGSOC and FTE, when comparedwith OSE, which was consistent with the tubal origin theory of HGSOC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8346 PMCID: PMC5920857PMID: 29731902
