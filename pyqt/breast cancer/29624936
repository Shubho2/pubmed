Worldwide, it ispredicted that more than one million women are diagnosed with breast cancer, and more than 400,000 will die from the disease every year. A comparative integrativereview of the literature from Nigeria and Canada showed that in Canada, there is positive association between wide spread education, early detection, the disease stage at diagnosis, and survival rates. In Nigeria, presentation with theadvanced stage of the disease makes survival very low. The primary factorsresponsible for the late presentations are lack of awareness, misconceptionsabout breast cancer causes, and treatment outcomes. It is recommended thatguidelines and policies about breast cancer early detection, care strategies, andongoing management pathways be produced, disseminated, and adopted. Theguidelines will assist practitioners and patients in making informed decisionsand choices about the most appropriate health care for their specific clinicalsituations. The implementation of evidence-based guidelines will most likely helpto improve care processes, the quality of clinical decisions and patienttreatment outcome.PMID: 29624936  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
