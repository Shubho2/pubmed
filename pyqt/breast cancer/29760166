Epub2018 May 14.The role of IL-1B in breast cancer bone metastasis.Tulotta C(1), Ottewell P(2).Author information: (1)Department of Oncology and MetabolismMellanby Centre for Bone Research,University of Sheffield, Medical School, Sheffield, UK.(2)Department of Oncology and MetabolismMellanby Centre for Bone Research,University of Sheffield, Medical School, Sheffield, UKP.D.Ottewell@sheffield.ac.uk.Approximately 75% of patients with late-stage breast cancer will develop bonemetastasis. This condition is currently considered incurable and patients' lifeexpectancy is limited to 2-3 years following diagnosis of bone involvement.Interleukin (IL)-1B is a pro-inflammatory cytokine whose expression in primarytumours has been identified as a potential biomarker for predicting breast cancerpatients at increased risk for developing bone metastasis. In this review, wediscuss how IL-1B from both the tumour cells and the tumour microenvironmentinfluence growth of primary breast tumours, dissemination into the bonemetastatic niche and proliferation into overt metastases. Recent evidenceindicates that targeting IL-1B signalling may provide promising new treatmentsthat can hold tumour cells in a dormant state within bone thus preventingformation of overt bone metastases.Â© 2018 The authors.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-17-0309 PMCID: PMC5987176PMID: 29760166
