This parallel design, triple-blind, randomized andplacebo controlled clinical trial was conducted on 85 eligible women diagnosedwith BBD who recruited from Nour-Nejat hospital, Tabriz, Iran. Participants were randomly allocated into either intervention group who received BV juice (480mL/day, n = 44) or BV juice placebo at the same time (480 mL/day, n = 41). After a 7 day run-in period, treatments were administered for the duration of 8 weeks. Participants, care givers and those who assessed laboratory analyses were blindedto the assignments (IRCT registry no: IRCT2012110511335N2). The relativetreatment effects of BV supplementation showed decreased serum levels of insulin for 19%, C-peptide for 8%, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistanceindex (HOMA-IR) for 16% and glucose to insulin ratio for 22% but HOMA-B increased44% relative to placebo group over 8 weeks BV supplementation. Although thesechanges were not statistical significant, the mean changes for C-peptide andHOMA-B were significant just after adjusting for baseline data and covariates.Administration of BV juice showed controlling effects on HOMA related indices,consequently might have beneficial effects on insulin signaling-related functionsin women with benign breast tumor.PMCID: PMC5958330PMID: 29796035
