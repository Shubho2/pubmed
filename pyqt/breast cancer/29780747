Hormone receptor-positive tumors have favorable outcomes in comparison to estrogen receptor (ESR1, ER)/progesteronereceptor-negative tumors given the targetable nature of these tumors, as well as their inherently less aggressive character. Nonetheless, treatment resistance is frequently encountered due to a variety of mechanisms, including ESR1 mutationsand loss of ER expression. A new era of precision medicine utilizes a range ofmethodologies to allow real-time analysis of individual genomic signatures inmetastases and liquid biopsies with the goal of finding clinically actionabletargets. Preliminary studies have shown improved progression-free survival andoverall survival with implementation of this information for clinical decisionmaking. In this review, we will discuss the opportunities and challenges inintegrating precision medicine through next-generation genomic sequencing intothe management of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00144 PMCID: PMC5945817PMID: 29780747
