The patients'clinical and pathological characteristics were analyzed. Overall survival (OS)was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. Independent risk factors associated withdisease special mortality (DSM) were identified by multivariable regressionanalysis.A total of 7187 mHCC patients from SEER database were identified. Atotal of 258 (3.6%) patients had received surgery treatment (ST), 64 (0.9%)patients underwent radiotherapy (RT), and 6865 (95.5%) patients were identifiedto no surgery or radiation therapy group (NSR). Compared with the patients in NSRgroup, patients who received ST (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.26, 95% confidence interval[CI] 0.22-0.31, P < .001) and RT (HR: 0.51, 95% CI 0.38-0.67, P < .001) haddecreased DSM. Patients with age >50 years, female, and T3 or higher stage wereassociated with increased DSM.The present study demonstrated the survival benefitof definitive LT in mHCC patients. However, a large randomized clinical trial to validate the role of LT in mHCC is necessary in the future.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010020 PMCID: PMC5882428PMID: 29517658  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
