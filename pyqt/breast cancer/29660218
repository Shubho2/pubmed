We found that both strands of pre-miR-148a (miR-148a-5p: the passenger strand and miR-148a-3p: the guidestrand) were downregulated in cancer tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-148a-5pand miR-148a-3p significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion,indicating that both strands of pre-miR-148a had tumor-suppressive roles in PDAC cells. In silico database and genome-wide gene expression analyses identified atotal of 15 genes that were putative targets regulated by these miRNAs. Highexpression of miR-148a-5p targets (PHLDA2, LPCAT2 and AP1S3) and miR-148a-3ptargets (SMA, ENDOD1 and UHMK1) was associated with poor prognosis of patientswith PDAC. Moreover, knockdown of PHLDA2 expression inhibited cancer cellaggressiveness, suggesting PHLDA2 acted as an oncogene in PDAC cells. Involvementof the passenger strand of pre-miR-148a (miR-148-5p) is a new concept in cancerresearch. Novel approaches that identify tumor-suppressive miRNA regulatorynetworks in lethal PDAC might provide new prognostic markers and therapeutictargets for this disease.Â© 2018 The Authors.
