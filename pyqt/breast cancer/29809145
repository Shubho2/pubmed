In the present study, we show that proton-driven lactate flux isenhanced by the intracellular carbonic anhydrase CAII, which is colocalized with the monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Co-expression of MCTs with various CAII mutants in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that CAIIfacilitates MCT transport activity in a process involving CAII-Glu69 andCAII-Asp72, which could function as surface proton antennae for the enzyme.CAII-Glu69 and CAII-Asp72 seem to mediate proton transfer between enzyme andtransporter, but CAII-His64, the central residue of the enzyme's intramolecularproton shuttle, is not involved in proton shuttling between the two proteins.Instead, this residue mediates binding between MCT and CAII. Taken together, the results suggest that CAII features a moiety that exclusively mediates protonexchange with the MCT to facilitate transport activity.Â© 2018, Noor et al.DOI: 10.7554/eLife.35176 PMCID: PMC5986270PMID: 29809145
