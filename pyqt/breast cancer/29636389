Here, we identified the importin-binding region in p38 and JNK anddeveloped a myristoylated peptide targeting this site that we called PERY. ThePERY peptide specifically blocked the interaction of p38 and JNK with theimportins, restricted their nuclear translocation, and inhibited phosphorylation of their nuclear (but not cytoplasmic) substrates. Through these effects, thePERY peptide reduced the proliferation of several (but not all) cancer cell linesin culture and inhibited the growth of a human breast cancer xenograft in mice.In addition, the PERY peptide substantially inhibited inflammation in mice, asmanifested in models of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer. The PERYpeptide more effectively prevented colon cancer development than did a commercialp38 inhibitor. In vivo analysis further suggested that this effect was mediatedby PERY peptide-induced prevention of the nuclear translocation of p38 inmacrophages. Together, these results support the use of the nuclear translocationof p38 and JNK as a novel drug target to treat various cancers andinflammation-induced diseases.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science.
