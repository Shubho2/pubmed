Only individuals with documented smoking status were included.Smokers and non-smokers were matched (1:1) by age, gender, index year, body mass index, and physician. The main outcome of the study was the risk of cancer as afunction of smoking status. Data regarding a total of 25 cancers were availablefor the present analysis. The risk of cancer was analyzed using Cox's regression model.Results: The present retrospective study included 211,005 smokers and 211,005non-smokers. The mean age was 36.5 years (SD = 12.5 years) in men and 34.3 years (SD = 13.1 years) in women. There was a slightly positive association betweensmoking and any cancer in both men (HR = 1.07) and women (HR = 1.03). Smoking wasfurther found to be positively associated with several cancers, such as livercancer, bladder and kidney cancers, pancreas cancer, and lymphoma. By contrast,the use of tobacco was negatively associated with the risk of developing skincancer, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, endometrial carcinoma, or breastcancer.Conclusions: Smoking increased the overall risk of cancer in primary carepractices in the UK. In addition, smoking was predominantly positively and lessfrequently negatively associated with numerous specific cancers.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24724 PMCID: PMC5915125PMID: 29707117
