High expression of claudin-7 (OR=65.8, 95%CI=4.35-995.19,p-value=0.003) and low expression of c-kit (OR=0.14, 95%CI=0.025-0.793,p-value=0.026) and protein p63 (OR=0.18 95%CI=0.035-0.978, p-value=0.047) wasassociated with higher tumour grade. Higher AR expression (OR=13.44,95%CI=1.28-141.56, p-value=0.031) and lower expression of CK5/6 cytokeratins was found in patients with positive lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (OR=0.072,95%CI=0.007-0.732, p-value=0.026). Only the cell proliferation index (Ki67) hasbeen proven to be statistically significant for disease-free survival(p-value=0.0378), and overall survival (p-value=0.0186).CONCLUSION: High expression of claudin-7 and low expression of c-kit and protein p63 are associated with higher tumour grade. AR and CK5/6 expression seem to beimportant in LVI.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/invivo.11238 PMCID: PMC5905198PMID: 29475913
