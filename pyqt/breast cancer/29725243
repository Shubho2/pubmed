MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small highly conserved regulatory endogenous non-coding RNA, which can alter the expression of genes encoding proteins and may play a role in the dysregulation ofcellular pathways. Our goal was to improve the knowledge of the molecularpathogenesis of TNBC subgroups analyzing the miRNA expression profile, and toidentify new prognostic and predictive biomarkers. We conducted a human miRNomeanalysis by TaqMan Low Density Array comparing different TNBC subtypes, definedby immunohistochemical basal markers EGFR and CK5/6. RT-qPCR confirmeddifferential expression of microRNAs. To inspect the function of the selectedtargets we perform Gene Ontology and KEGG enrichment analysis. We identified asingle miRNA signature given by miR-135b expression level, which was strictlyrelated to TNBC with basal-like phenotype. miR-135b target analysis revealed arole in the TGF-beta, WNT and ERBB pathways. A significant positive correlationwas identified between neoplastic proliferative index and miR-135b expression.These findings confirm the oncogenic roles of miR-135b in the pathogenesis ofTNBC expressing basal markers. A potential negative prognostic role of miR-135boverexpression might be related to the positive correlation with highproliferative index. Our study implies potential clinical applications: miR-135b could be a potential therapeutic target in basal-like TNBCs.DOI: 10.7150/ijms.23402 PMCID: PMC5930454PMID: 29725243
