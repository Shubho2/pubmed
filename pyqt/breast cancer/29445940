Young black women have higher incidencerates of breast cancer and more aggressive subtypes than women of otherraces/ethnicities. In this study, we examined recent trends and variations inbreast cancer incidence among young women in the United States.METHODS: Using 2004-2013 National Program of Cancer Registries and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program data, we calculated breast cancer incidencerates and trends and examined variations in stage, grade, and tumor subtype byage and race/ethnicity among young women aged 20-49 years.RESULTS: The majority of breast cancer cases occurred in women aged 40-44 and45-49 years (77.3%). Among women aged < 45 years, breast cancer incidence washighest among black women. Incidence trends increased from 2004 to 2013 for Asianor Pacific Islander (API) women and white women aged 20-34 years. Black, AmericanIndian or Alaska Native, and Hispanic women had higher proportions of casesdiagnosed at later stages than white and API women. Black women had a higherproportion of grade III-IV tumors than other racial/ethnic groups. Across all agegroups, incidence rates for triple-negative breast cancer were significantlyhigher in black women than women of other races/ethnicities, and this disparityincreased with age.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer among young women is a highly heterogeneous disease.Differences in tumor characteristics by age and race/ethnicity suggestopportunities for further research into personal and cultural factors that mayinfluence breast cancer risk among younger women.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4699-9 PMCID: PMC5955792 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29445940
