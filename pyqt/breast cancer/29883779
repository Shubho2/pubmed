[Epub ahead of print]Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte volume is a better predictor of neoadjuvant therapyresponse and overall survival in triple negative invasive breast Cancer.Zhang L(1), Wang XI(1), Zhang S(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas HealthScience Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030.(2)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas HealthScience Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030. Electronic address:Songlin.Zhang@uth.tmc.edu.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has an aggressive behavior, limitedtherapeutic options, and high mortality rate. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is a standard treatment for TNBC and patients with pathological complete response(pCR) have a favorable outcome. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of cancerclinicopathologic parameters, and correlated these parameters with the pCR rateand the overall survival. Fifty-eight patients with TNBC of no special type whounderwent breast biopsy, neoadjuvant therapy, and mastectomy in our institutionduring 2005-2016 were included in this study. Among the fifty-eight TNBCpatients, twenty-six (45%) achieved pCR and thirty-two (55%) had RD. The studyparameters included age, histologic grade, clinical stage, mitotic count, Ki-67proliferation index, stromal ratio, stromal type, tumor necrosis, stromal tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), intratumoral lymphocytes, and tumor infiltratinglymphocytes volume (TILV). While most factors didn't affect pCR, stromal tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte volume (TILV)showed significant correlation with pCR (P=.01 and P=.0008, respectively). In theRD group, all factors showed no significant differences before and after NACT,except for tumor sizes. Lastly, pCR, TILs and TILV were all significantlycorrelated with the overall survival, with p value 0.028, 0.029 and 0.015,respectively. In summary, we proposed a new concept of TILV to precisely evaluatethe tumor immunity, and our data showed TILV had a better predictive value thanTILs for the pCR and the overall survival in TNBC.Copyright Â© 2018.
