The tumour microenvironment, including hypoxia, is amajor driver of metastasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the E3 ligase WSB-1 in breast cancer biology in the context of the hypoxic tumourmicroenvironment, particularly regarding metastatic spread.METHODS: In this study, WSB-1 expression was evaluated in breast cancer celllines and patient samples. In silico analyses were used to determine the impactof WSB-1 expression on distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in patients, andcorrelation between WSB1 expression and hypoxia gene expression signatures. Therole of WSB-1 on metastasis promotion was evaluated in vitro and in vivo.RESULTS: High WSB1 expression was associated with decreased DMFS in ER-breastcancer and PR-breast cancer patients. Surprisingly, WSB1 expression was notpositively correlated with known hypoxic gene expression signatures in patientsamples. Our study is the first to show that WSB-1 knockdown led to decreasedmetastatic potential in breast cancer hormone receptor-negative models in vitroand in vivo. WSB-1 knockdown was associated with decreased metalloproteinase(MMP) activity, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, andangiogenic potential.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that WSB-1 may be an important regulator ofaggressive metastatic disease in hormone receptor-negative breast cancer. WSB-1could therefore represent a novel regulator and therapeutic target for secondary breast cancer in these patients.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0056-3 PMID: 29540773
