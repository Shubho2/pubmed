Our results revealed that the anticancer activity of the synthesized compounds was selectively affected by the presence of methoxy group on the linkerbetween quinazolinone and 1,2,3-triazole moieties. According to the calculatedIC50 values, compounds 6q, 6w, and 6x showed good cytotoxicity against breastcancer cell lines even more effective than the reference drug, etoposide.Compounds 6q and 6u were found to be potent compounds against A549,non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), comparing with erlotinib. Also, themorphological analysis by acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining testand flow cytometry analysis indicated that potent compounds induced apoptosis in human cancer cell lines. Molecular docking studies were performed to clarify the inhibition mode of compounds 6g, 6u, 6w, and 6x over the EGFR active site. Themost promising compounds, 6q and 6u, possessing 3-methoxy group were welloriented to the gatekeeper hydrophobic pocket of EGFR active site and interactwell with Ala719, Val702, and Leu820 through hydrophobic interaction.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.DOI: 10.1111/cbdd.13203 PMID: 29637699
