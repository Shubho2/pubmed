All three leadsare based on an N-methylglycinamide scaffold, with its two amine groups condensedwith three different functionalities. The three functionalities and the CH2 groupof the glycinamide scaffold were separately modified. The replacement of thepentafluorobenzene or cyclohexylbenzene, or replacing the benzene ring of thearomatic carboxylic or hydroxamic acid motif with heterocyclic components(containing nitrogen and oxygen elements) all decreased potency. Notably, theAla-linker analogues, 1a and 2v, and the Pro-based derivative 5d, all with(R)-configuration at the chiral center, had improved inhibitory activity andselectivity against STAT3 DNA-binding activity in vitro, with IC50 of 3.0 ± 0.9, 1.80 ± 0.94, and 2.4 ± 0.2 μM, respectively. Compounds 1a, 2v, 5d, and otheranalogues inhibited constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation and activation in humanbreast cancer and melanoma lines, and blocked tumor cell viability, growth,colony formation, and migration in vitro. Pro-based analogue, 5h, with arelatively polar tetrahydropyranyl (THP) ring, instead of the cyclohexyl, showed improved permeability. In general, the (R)-configuration Pro-based analogs showedthe overall best profile, including physicochemical properties (e.g., microsomal metabolic stability, Caco-2 permeability), and in particular, 5d showed improved tumor-cell specificity.DOI: 10.1021/acsmedchemlett.7b00544 PMCID: PMC5846032 [Available on 2019-03-08]PMID: 29541369
