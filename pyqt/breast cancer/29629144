Thisdegenerative process can lead to bone pain and pathological bone fracture, amajor cause of cancer morbidity and diminished quality of life, which isexacerbated by our limited ability to monitor early metastatic disease in boneand assess fracture risk. Spurred by its label-free, real-time nature and itsexquisite molecular specificity, we employed spontaneous Raman spectroscopy toassess and quantify early metastasis driven biochemical alterations to bonecomposition. As early as two weeks after intracardiac inoculations of MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells in NOD-SCID mice, Raman spectroscopic measurements in thefemur and spine revealed consistent changes in carbonate substitution, overallmineralization as well as crystallinity increase in tumor-bearing bones whencompared with their normal counterparts. Our observations reveal the possibility of early stage detection of biochemical changes in the tumor-bearing bones -significantly before morphological variations are captured through radiographicdiagnosis. This study paves the way for a better molecular understanding ofaltered bone remodeling in such metastatic niches, and for further clinicalstudies with the goal of establishing a non-invasive tool for early metastasisdetection and prediction of pathological fracture risk in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1039/c7sc02905e PMCID: PMC5869989PMID: 29629144
