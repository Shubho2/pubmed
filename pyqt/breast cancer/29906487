Electronic address:lubmito@wmu.edu.cn.Deferoxamine (DFO) was found to modulate multiple cellular pathways involved inthe growth of breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer and bladdercancer. However, the effect of DFO on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)remains unclear. Here, we report that DFO-treated ESCC cells show stronganti-tumorigenic properties, such as inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of cell cycle arrest, and promotion of apoptosis. Mechanistically, DFOsignificantly activated ERK1/2 signaling, which is reactive oxygen species(ROS)-dependent. ERK1/2 activation suppressed mitochondrial respiration andaerobic glycolysis in ESCC cells, resulting in reduced production of ATP and key precursor metabolites. Cell proliferation was functionally rescued by the ROSscavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and the ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH7 72984.Additionally, our data showed that activated ERK1/2 was partially translocated tothe mitochondria, which indicated that DFO-activated ERK1/2 may suppress tumorformation through inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, thedecreased c-Myc expression caused by DFO resulted in the inhibition of cellmigration. Taken together, our study demonstrate that DFO activates ERK1/2 anddownregulates c-Myc to perturb mitochondrial homeostasis and promote apoptosis,resulting in the novel anti-neoplastic activity of DFO in ESCC.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
