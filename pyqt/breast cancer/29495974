[Epub ahead ofprint]MicroRNA-664 targets Insulin receptor substrate 1 to suppress cell proliferation and invasion in breast cancer.Wu L(1), Li Y(1), Li J(1), Ma D(1).Author information: (1)Department of Oncology, Linyi Central Hospital, Linyi, Shandong 276400, China.A large number of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been previously demonstrated to bedysregulated in breast cancer (BC), and alterations in miRNA expression mayaffect the initiation and progression of BC. This study showed that miR-664expression was obviously reduced in BC tissues and cell lines. Resumptionexpression of miR-664 attenuated the proliferation and invasion of BC cells. The molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of BC cell proliferationand invasion by miR-664 was also studied. Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) wasidentified as a novel and direct target of miR-664. In addition, siRNA-mediatedsilencing of IRS1 expression mimicked the suppressive effects of miR-664overexpression in BC cells. Rescue experiments demonstrated that recovered IRS1expression partially antagonized the inhibition of proliferation and invasion of BC cells caused by miR-664 overexpression. Thus, miR664 may serve as a tumorsuppressor in BC by directly targeting IRS1. Moreover, miR664 down-regulation in BC may contribute to the occurrence and development of BC, suggesting thatmiR-664 may be a novel therapeutic target for patients with BC.DOI: 10.3727/096504018X15193500663936 PMID: 29495974
