Persistent postsurgical pain is relatively refractory totreatment hence generating a high need for preventive strategies and treatments. Therefore, the identification of patients at risk of developing persistent painis an area of active ongoing research. Recently it was demonstrated thatperi-operative disruptions in central pain processing may be able to predictpersistent postsurgical pain at long term follow-up in breast cancer patients.The aim of the current report is to present a short protocol to obtain painthresholds to different stimuli at multiple sites and a measure of endogenousanalgesia in breast cancer patients. We have used this method successfully in aclinical context and detail some representative results from a clinical study.DOI: 10.3791/56918 PMID: 29443087  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
