Aberrant regulation of various growth factors, cytokines, and otherproteins and their receptors in cancer cells drives the activation of variousoncogenic signaling pathways that lead to cancer progression. Semaphorins are aclass of proteins which are differentially expressed in various types of cancerincluding breast cancer. Earlier, these proteins were known to have a majorfunction in the nerve cell adhesion, migration, and development of the centralnervous system. However, their role in the regulation of several aspects of tumorprogression has eventually emerged. There are over 30 genes encoding thesemaphorins, which are divided into eight subclasses. It has been reported thatsome members of semaphorin classes are antiangiogenic and antimetastatic innature, whereas others act as proangiogenic and prometastatic genes. Because oftheir differential expression and role in angiogenesis and metastasis,semaphorins emerged as one of the important prognostic factors for appraisingbreast cancer progression.DOI: 10.2147/BCTT.S135753 PMCID: PMC5987790PMID: 29910635
