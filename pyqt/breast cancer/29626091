It forms intercellular gap junction (GJ)channels, enabling adjacent cells to communicate both electrically andmetabolically. Cx43 is a short-lived protein which can be quickly degraded by theubiquitin-dependent proteasomal, endolysosomal, and autophagosomal pathways.Here, we report that the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) interacts with anddeubiquitinates Cx43. USP8 reduces both multiple monoubiquitination andpolyubiquitination of Cx43 to prevent autophagy-mediated degradation.Consistently, knockdown of USP8 results in decreased Cx43 protein levels incultured cells and suppresses intercellular communication, revealed by the dyetransfer assay. In human breast cancer specimens, the expression levels of USP8and Cx43 proteins are positively correlated. Taken together, these resultsidentified USP8 as a crucial and bona fide deubiquitinating enzyme involved inautophagy-mediated degradation of Cx43.Â© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA117.001315 PMCID: PMC5971442 [Available on 2019-05-25]PMID: 29626091
