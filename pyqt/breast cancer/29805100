Tumor-bearing mice displayedinterleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated peripheral inflammation, coincident with alteredhepatic glucose processing and sleep. Tumor-bearing mice were hyperphagic, hadreduced serum leptin concentrations, and enhanced sensitivity to exogenousghrelin. We tested whether these phenotypes were driven by inflammation usingneutralizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6; despite the reduction in IL-6signaling, metabolic and sleep abnormalities persisted. We next investigatedneural populations coupling metabolism and sleep, and observed altered activitywithin lateral-hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin (HO) neurons. We used a dualHO-receptor antagonist to test whether increased HO signaling was causingmetabolic abnormalities. This approach rescued metabolic abnormalities andenhanced sleep quality in tumor-bearing mice. Peripheral sympathetic denervation prevented tumor-induced increases in serum glucose. Our results link metabolicand sleep abnormalities via the HO system, and provide evidence that centralneuromodulators contribute to tumor-induced changes in metabolism.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
