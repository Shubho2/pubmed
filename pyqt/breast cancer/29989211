[Epub ahead ofprint]Traceable Bioinspired Nanoparticle for the Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer via NIR-Trigged Intracellular Delivery of Methylene Blue and Cisplatin.Zhai Y(1)(2), Ran W(1)(2), Su J(1)(2), Lang T(1)(2), Meng J(1)(2), Wang G(1),Zhang P(1)(2), Li Y(1)(2)(3).Author information: (1)State Key Laboratory of Drug Research & Center of Pharmaceutics, ShanghaiInstitute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 501 Haike Road,Shanghai, 201203, China.(2)School of Pharmacy, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 Yuquan Road,Beijing, 100049, China.(3)School of Pharmacy, Yantai University, 30 Qingquan Road, Yantai, 264005,China.Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) eliminates abnormal cells through targetrecognition-triggered intracellular toxin delivery. Chimeric antigen receptorT-cell improves cancer cell recognition of CTL, but its effectiveness and safety in solid tumor treatment are still hampered by poor tumor infiltration,suppressive tumor microenvironment, and severe on-target off-tumor toxicity.Given the functionality and challenges of CTL in cancer therapy, herein, aCTL-inspired nanovesicle (MPV) with a cell membrane-derived shell and a methyleneblue (MB) and cisplatin (Pt) loaded gelatin nanogel core is created. The MPVgenerates contrast for tumor photoacoustic imaging, and produces hyperthermiaupon laser irradiation, enabling photothermal imaging and deep tumor penetration.Meanwhile, it releases MB and Pt, and then delivers them into the cytosol ofcancer cells, which process can be visualized by imaging the recovery ofMB-derived fluorescence. The localized hyperthermia, photodynamic therapy, andchemotherapy together kill 4T1 breast cancer cells effectively, resulting inprimary tumor regression and 97% inhibition of pulmonary metastasis, withoutsignificant toxicity to the animals. Taken together, the MPV shows tumor-specificand stimuli-triggered intracellular toxin delivery with advantages in traceableaccumulation and activation, high tumor penetration, and triple combinationtherapy, and thus can be an effective nanomedicine for combating metastaticbreast cancer.Â© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
