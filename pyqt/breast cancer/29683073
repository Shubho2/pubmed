This study aims to assess the association between singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of LOC643714 (rs12922061) and TOX3 (rs3803662)and breast cancer, as well as the clinical characteristics of tumors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 104 breast cancer patients and 118 healthycontrols were recruited to our study. The genotyping was performed by the SNPscan method. General characteristics, the clinical characteristics of tumors and reproductive factors were included in the analysis. Statistical tests includedthe Student t-test, the Chi-square test (X2) or Fisher's exact test, andunconditional logistic regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristiccurves were used to evaluate the predictive role of rs12922061 in breast cancer.RESULTS: The LOC643714 polymorphism was a risk factor for breast cancer under adominant model (TT+TC vs. CC: OR 1.801; 95% CI 1.048, 3.095; statisticalpower=60%), recessive model (TT vs. TC + CC: OR 4.297; 95% CI 1.164, 15.867;statistical power=64%) and log-additive (TT vs. CC: OR 5.163; 95% CI 1.368,19.485; statistical power= 73%). Furthermore, the rs12922061 polymorphism wasassociated with menopause status in patients ( P=0.005). No statisticallysignificant association was found between the rs3803662 polymorphism and breastcancer in patients or healthy controls.CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that rs12922061 of LOC643714 was related to breastcancer risk. With a limited sample size and statistical power, furthermulti-center studies are needed to confirm the influence of the LOC643714polymorphisms on breast cancer based on larger populations.DOI: 10.1177/1724600818755633 PMID: 29683073
