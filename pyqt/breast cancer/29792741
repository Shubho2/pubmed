The aim of this review is to discuss the clinical presentation,imaging appearance, and management of mesenchymal breast lesions.CONCLUSION: Although many mesenchymal tumors exhibit characteristic findings onimaging, others show nonspecific characteristics and require tissue biopsy fordiagnosis. An awareness of the clinical and imaging presentation is essential in guiding the differential diagnosis and patient management.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.17.19020 PMID: 29792741
