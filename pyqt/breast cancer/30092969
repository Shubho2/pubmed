Echocardiography serves as the cornerstone in the detection andsurveillance of CTRCD in patients during and after cancer therapy. Guidelinesfrom professional societies and regulatory agencies have been published onapproaches to surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment of CTRCD, although adoption as standard of care remains limited given the lack of evidence on the prognostic value of asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in the oncologypopulation. The frequency of cardiac monitoring and the appropriateness of theFood and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended cardiac monitoring schedule in allpatients receiving trastuzumab for breast cancer has been challenged.Interruption versus continuation of oncological therapy in the setting ofasymptomatic LV dysfunction remains a clinical conundrum given the uncertainbalance of the risk of cardiac dysfunction and benefit of oncology efficacy.Despite their limitations, echocardiographic measures of LV function continue to play a pivotal role in clinical decision making, with global longitudinal strain emerging as a promising tool in informing and facilitating the selection ofcancer treatment and optimizing cardiovascular outcomes. This review highlightsthe key recommendations of the existing guidelines and discusses recentdevelopments in cardio-oncology imaging practices with the aim of providingpractical guidance on the role and use of echocardiography in challengingclinical cases in cardio-oncology.Copyright Â© 2018 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
