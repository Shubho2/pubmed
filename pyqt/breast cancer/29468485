P7731 was analyzed for DNA copy number variation, somatic mutations, and gene expression and wascompared with the primary tumor.RESULTS: P7731 cells are negative for estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±), progesteronereceptor (PR), and HER2 (triple-negative); strongly express vimentin (100% ofcells positive) and also express cytokeratins 8/18 and 19 but at lowerfrequencies. Flow cytometry indicates P7731 cells are predominantlyCD44+/CD49f+/EpCAM-, consistent with a primitive, mesenchymal-like phenotype. Thecell line is tumorigenic in immunocompromised mice. Exome sequencing identified atotal of 45 and 76 somatic mutations in the primary tumor and cell line,respectively, of which 32 were identified in both samples and included mutations in known driver genes PIK3CA, TP53, and ARID1A. P7731 retains the DNA copy numberalterations present in the matching primary tumor. Homozygous deletions detected in the cell line and in the primary tumor were found in regions containing three known (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and CDKN1B) and 23 putative tumor suppressor genes. Cellline-specific gene amplification coupled with mRNA expression analysis revealedgenes and pathways with potential pro-metastatic functions.CONCLUSION: This novel human breast cancer-bone metastasis cell line will be auseful model to study aspects of breast cancer biology, particularlymetastasis-related changes from breast to bone.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4719-9 PMID: 29468485
