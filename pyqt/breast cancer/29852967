The high mortality rate of breast cancer is largely due to thecomplexity among invasive breast cancer and its significantly varied clinicaloutcomes. Therefore, improving the accuracy of breast cancer survival prediction has important significance and becomes one of the major research areas. Nowadays many computational models have been proposed for breast cancer survivalprediction, however, most of them generate the predictive models by employingonly the genomic data information and few of them consider the complementaryinformation from pathological images.METHODS: In our study, we introduce a novel method called GPMKL based on multiplekernel learning (MKL), which efficiently employs heterogeneous informationcontaining genomic data (gene expression, copy number alteration, genemethylation, protein expression) and pathological images. With aboveheterogeneous features, GPMKL is proposed to execute feature fusion which isembedded in breast cancer classification.RESULTS: Performance analysis of the GPMKL model indicates that the pathological image information plays a critical part in accurately predicting the survivaltime of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, the proposed method is compared withother existing breast cancer survival prediction methods, and the resultsdemonstrate that the proposed framework with pathological images performsremarkably better than the existing survival prediction methods.CONCLUSIONS: All results performed in our study suggest that the usefulness andsuperiority of GPMKL in predicting human breast cancer survival.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
