Also, RT-qRCR, luciferase reporterassay and RNA-sequencing were used for transcription detection. Chromatinimmunoprecipitation (ChIP) using H4K16ac antibody in conjunction with qPCR wasused for determining H4K16ac levels in targeted genes. Furthermore, in vitro cellproliferation assay and in vivo tumor xenografts were used to detect the effectof TRPS1 on tumor growth.RESULTS: We found that TRPS1 scaffolding recruits and enhances interactionbetween USP4 and HDAC2 leading to HDAC2 de-ubiquitination and H4K16deacetylation. We detected repression of a set of cellular growth-related genesby the TRPS1-USP4-HDAC2 axis indicating it is essential in tumor growth. In vitroand in vivo experiments confirmed that silencing TRPS1 reduced tumor growth,whereas overexpression of HDAC2 restored tumor growth.CONCLUSION: Our study deciphered the TRPS1-USP4-HDAC2 axis as a novel mechanismthat contributes to tumor growth. Significantly, our results revealed thescaffolding function of TPRS1 in USP4-directed HDAC2 de-ubiquitination andprovided new mechanistic insights into the crosstalk between TRPS1, ubiquitin,and histone modification systems leading to tumor growth.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1018-7 PMID: 30071870
