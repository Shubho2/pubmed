Epub 2018Apr 2.Remotely Phototriggered, Transferrin-Targeted Polymeric Nanoparticles for theTreatment of Breast Cancer.Jadia R(1), Kydd J(1), Rai P(1)(2).Author information: (1)Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology Program, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA.(2)Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Massachusetts Lowell,Lowell, MA.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the worst prognosis among all subtypesof breast cancer. Currently, no targeted treatment has been approved for TNBC.The goal of this study was to design a remotely triggered, targeted therapy forTNBC using polymeric nanoparticles and light. Active targeting of TNBC wasachieved by conjugating the nanoparticles to a peptide (hTf) that binds to thetransferrin receptor, which is overexpressed in TNBC. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was explored for TNBC treatment by remotely triggering benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid (BPD), a photosensitizer, using near-infrared light. In this study, weinvestigated the use of actively targeting polymeric nanoparticles for PDTagainst TNBC using in vitro imaging and cytotoxicity studies. Fluorescenceimaging confirmed that the BPD-loaded nanoparticles showed greater fluorescencein TNBC cells compared to free BPD, but more importantly, actively targetednanoparticles displayed stronger fluorescence compared to passively targetednanoparticles. Moreover, fluorescence imaging following competition with emptytargeted nanoparticles validated the specificity of the targeted nanoparticlesfor TNBC cells. The PDT killing results were in line with the fluorescenceimaging results, where actively targeting nanoparticles exhibited the highestphototriggered cytotoxicity in TNBC cells, making them an attractive nanoplatformfor TNBC treatment.Â© 2018 The American Society of Photobiology.DOI: 10.1111/php.12903 PMID: 29427385
