[Epub ahead ofprint]Preclinical study of the antitumor effect of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1antibody (S1PR1-antibody) against human breast cancer cells.Xiao S(1), Yang J(2).Author information: (1)Drug Discovery and Development Research Group, College of Pharmacy andNutrition, 107 Wiggins Road, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 5E5, Canada.(2)Drug Discovery and Development Research Group, College of Pharmacy andNutrition, 107 Wiggins Road, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 5E5, Canada. jian.yang@usask.ca.Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, whichregulates a broad range of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Thesignaling of S1P via its cell surface receptor S1PR1 has been identified to play an important role in carcinogenesis, cancer growth and survival, and tumormetastasis. In this study, we evaluated whether a monoclonal antibody againstS1PR1 (S1PR1-antibody) could impose any effect on cell growth of human breastcancer SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The S1PR1-antibody exhibited cytostaticeffect against both cell lines at the concentration of 4000 ng/mL.Co-administration of 4000 ng/mL of the S1PR1-antibody not only potentiated thecytotoxicity of carboplatin towards the MDA-MB-231 cells but also increased theanti-proliferative effect of S1P towards the SK-BR-3 cells. Furthermore, weshowed that co-administration of S1P did not sensitize the SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231cells towards carboplatin.DOI: 10.1007/s10637-018-0618-5 PMID: 29860604
