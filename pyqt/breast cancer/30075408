Electronic address:ahmedkamal@iict.res.in.A library of new imidazopyridine linked triazole hybrid conjugates (8a-r) weredesigned, synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxicity against four cancercell lines namely, human lung (A549), human prostate (DU-145), human colon(HCT-116) and breast (MDA-MB 231) cancer. These conjugates exhibited good tomoderate activity against the tested human cancer cell lines. Two of theconjugates (8g and 8j) showed significant antitumor activity against human lungcancer cell line (A549) with IC50 values of 0.51 µM and 0.63 µM respectively.Flow cytometry analysis revealed that these conjugates arrested the cell cycle atG2/M phase in human lung cancer cell line (A549). Immune-histochemistry andtubulin polymerization assay suggest inhibition of tubulin. Hoechst staining,annexin V and DNA fragmentation by tunnel assay suggested that these compoundsinduce cell death by apoptosis. Overall, the current study demonstrates that the synthesis of imidazopyridine linked triazole conjugates as promising anticanceragents causing G2/M arrest and apoptotic-inducing ability.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
