The image reconstruction algorithm is a keysignal processing component of any CMI-based breast imaging system and impactsthe efficacy of CMI in detecting breast cancer. Several image reconstructionalgorithms for CMI have been developed since its inception. These imagereconstruction algorithms have been previously evaluated and compared, using bothnumerical and physical breast models, and healthy volunteer data. However, nostudy has been performed to evaluate the performance of image reconstructionalgorithms using clinical patient data. In this study, a variety of imagingalgorithms, including both data-independent and data-adaptive algorithms, wereevaluated using data obtained from a small-scale patient study conducted at theUniversity of Calgary. Six imaging algorithms were applied to reconstruct 3Dimages of five clinical patients. Reconstructed images for each algorithm andeach patient were compared to the available clinical reports, in terms ofabnormality detection and localisation. The imaging quality of each algorithm wasevaluated using appropriate quality metrics. The results of the conventionalDelay-and-Sum algorithm and the Delay-Multiply-and-Sum (DMAS) algorithm werefound to be consistent with the clinical information, with DMAS producing better quality images compared to all other algorithms.DOI: 10.3390/s18061678 PMCID: PMC6022049PMID: 29882893
