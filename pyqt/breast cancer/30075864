The use of adjuvant treatments aftersurgery is still controversial in this setting. We performed a retrospectivemulticenter analysis on a series of DCIS patients treated with BCS and adjuvantRT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected clinical data from nine Italian centers on1072 women having a diagnosis of DCIS and treated between 1997 and 2012. Wereported on the 5- and 10-year local recurrence (LR) rates, overall survival, andbreast cancer specific survival (BCSS) employing the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 8.4 years, 67 LR (6.3%) and 47 deaths (4.4%)were observed. LR rates at 5 and 10 years were 3.4% and 7.6%, respectively. BCSS rates at 5 and 10 years were 99.7% and 99.1%, respectively. At univariateregression analysis, postmenopausal state (p = 0.009), estrogen receptor (ER)(p = 0.0001) and progesterone receptor (p = 0.018) positivity and ET (p = 0.006) were inversely correlated with LR. Final surgical margins (FSM) status <1 mm was significantly correlated with higher LR (p = 0.003). At multivariate regressionanalysis postmenopausal state (p = 0.03), and ER positive (p = 0.045) maintained the significant favorable feature, while FSM <1 mm (p = 0.024) confirmed itsnegative impact on LR.CONCLUSIONS: Our real-life study pointed out the significant favorable prognosticrole of postmenopausal state and ER positive status on LR occurrence. FSM <1 mmwas significantly correlated to a higher chance to experience LR.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.radonc.2018.07.015 PMID: 30075864
