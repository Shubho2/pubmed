[Epub ahead ofprint]Sensitization of Cancer Cells via Non-Viral Delivery of Apoptosis InducingProteins Using a Cationic Bolaamphiphile.Narayanan K(1), Khan M(2), Gopalan B(3), Antony J(3), Das T(3), Yang YY(3), WanACA(3).Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, 26506,USA.(2)Department of Chemistry, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals,Dhahran, 34463, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.(3)Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The NanosSingapore, 138669,Singapore.Cationic bolaamphiphile polymers had been previously studied as efficientdelivery system for the delivery of proteins with relatively low toxicity. Here, the authors investigate the use of a protein delivery system based on a cationic bolaamphiphile to sensitize cancer cells toward apoptosis-inducing drugs as anovel approach for cancer therapy. The authors demonstrates the efficacy of thesystem by two strategies. The first strategy involves delivery of a survivinantibody to inhibit survivin activity. Sensitization of MCF-7 cells todoxorubicin is observed by survivin inhibition by antibodies. The IC50 ofdoxorubicin is reduced ≈2.5-fold after delivery of survivin antibodies to breast cancer cells and induction of apoptosis is shown by Western blotting withapoptosis specific antibodies. In a second approach, functional wild type p53 is delivered into p53-null liver cancer (Hep3B) cells, sensitizing the cells toward the p53 pathway drug, Nutlin. Nutlin reduced the viability of Hep3B cells by ≈42%at 15 μM concentration, demonstrating the effectiveness of p53 delivery. Theexpression of p21, a downstream target of p53 further confirmed the functionalstatus of the delivered protein.IN CONCLUSION: The successful delivery ofapoptosis inducing proteins and sensitization of cancer cells via cationicbolaamphiphile polymer represents a promising system for cancer therapeutics.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
