Multivariate analyses were performed with the "mixOmics" R package andthe first component of the stacked partial least-Squares discriminant analysisresults were used for searching the interested lncRNA, miRNA and mRNA. qRT-PCRwas applied to identify the bioinformatics results in four BrCa cell lines (MCF7,BT-20, ZR-75-1, and MX-1) and the breast epithelial cell line MCF-10 A. Thencells (MCF-1 and MX-1) were transfected with si-linc01561, miR-145-5p mimics and si-MMP11 to further investigate the effects of linc01561, miR-145-5p and MMP11 onthe BrCa cells proliferation and apoptosis.RESULTS: MixOmics results showed that linc01561, miR-145-5p and MMP11 might play important roles in BrCa. qRT-PCR results identified that in BrCa cell lines,linc01561 and MMP11 were higher expressed while miR-145-5p was lower expressedcompared with those in epithelial cell line. The linc01561 inhibition elevatedmiR-145-5p expression and then suppressed MMP11 expression. Moreover, linc01561inhibition suppressed the BrCa cells proliferation and promoted the apoptosis,which was realized by up-regulating expression of miR-145-5p and down-regulating expression of MMP11.CONCLUSION: In summary, the findings of this study, based on ceRNA theory,combining the research foundation of miR-145-5p and MMP11, and taking linc01561as a new study point, provide new insight into molecular-level reversingproliferation and apoptosis of BrCa.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
