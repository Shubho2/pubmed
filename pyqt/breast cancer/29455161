One of the main priorities is to preserve their quality of life andthe sustainability of social security systems. We have carried out this study to assess factors associated with the ability to work after cancer. Such insightshould help with the planning of rehabilitation needs and tailored programmes.PARTICIPANTS: We conducted this register-based cohort study using individual datafrom the Belgian Disability Insurance. Data on 15 543 socially insured Belgianpeople who entered into the long-term work disability between 2007 and 2011 dueto cancer were used.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimated the duration of workdisability using Kaplan-Meier and the cause-specific cumulative incidence ofability to work stratified by age, gender, occupational class and year ofentering the work disability system for 11 cancer sites using the Fine and Graymodel allowing for competing risks.RESULTS: The overall median time of work disability was 1.59 years (95% CI 1.52to 1.66), ranging from 0.75 to 4.98 years. By the end of follow-up, more thanone-third of the disabled cancer survivors were able to work (35%). While a largeproportion of the women were able to work at the end of follow-up, the men whowere able to work could do so sooner. Being women, white collar, young and havinghaematological, male genital or breast cancers were factors with thebestlikelihood to be able to return to work.CONCLUSION: Good prognostic factors for the ability to work were youth, woman,white collar and having breast, male genital or haematological cancers. Reviewingour results together with the cancer incidence predictions up to 2025 offers ahigh value for social security and rehabilitation planning and for ascertainingpatients' perspectives.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
