Attendingat least five CIM treatments less than 30 days between each session wasconsidered as high adherence to integrative care (AIC).RESULTS: Of 258 eligible patients reporting significant fatigue, follow-upassessment at 6 and 12 weeks was considered optimal for 120 patients in theintervention group and for 64 controls; 88 of treated patients found to beadherent to the IM intervention. At 12 weeks, ESAS (P < 0.001) and EORTC(p = 0.001) scores for fatigue improved more significantly in treated patients,with a higher percent with optimal relative dose intensity in the AIC subgroup,both at 6 weeks (P = 0.002) and at 12 weeks (P < 0.001). IM treatment wasparadoxically associated with a greater decrease in hemoglobin levels at 12 weeks(P = 0.016), more so in the AIC subgroup (P = 0.024).CONCLUSION: Integrative medicine program may alleviate cancer-related fatigue in patients with breast and gynecological cancer undergoing chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4271-5 PMID: 29882024
