All patients underwent computed tomography of the abdomen with 64-row multi- detector CT atbaseline and after 3 cycles of chemotherapy for response assessment. Imageanalysis was performed by 2 observers, based on the RECIST criteria (version1.1).Results: Computed tomography revealed partial response of hepatic metastases in 7patients (25%) by one observer and in 10 patients (35.7%) by the other observer, with good inter-observer agreement (k=0.75, percent agreement of 89.29%). Stable disease was detected in 19 patients (67.8%) by one observer and in 16 patients(57.1%) by the other observer, with good agreement (k=0.774, percent agreement of89.29%). Progressive disease was detected in 2 patients (7.2%) by both observers,with perfect agreement (k=1, percent agreement of 100%). The overallinter-observer agreement in the CT-based response assessment of hepaticmetastasis between the two observers was good (k=0.793, percent agreement of89.29%).Conclusions: We concluded that computed tomography is a reliable and reproducibleimaging modality for response assessment of hepatic metastases of breast canceraccording to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1).DOI: 10.12659/PJR.902930 PMCID: PMC5894063PMID: 29657622
