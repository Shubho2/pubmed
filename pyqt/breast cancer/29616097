China.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is extremely aggressive and associated with poor prognosis. There are no known predictive or prognostic markers for TNBC.Inhibition of tumor protein P53 (TP53) has been demonstrated to increase thelevels of cluster of differentiation 117 (CD117) in human colorectal cancercells. However, the function of TP53 in the regulation of CD117 in TNBC has, tothe best of our knowledge, not been reported. In the present study, theassociation between the expression of CD117 protein and TP53 mutations wasinvestigated, and their prognostic value in patients with TNBC was assessed. Atotal of 58 TNBC and 48 non-TNBC breast cancer tissue samples were assessed forthe expression of CD117, p53 and TP53 mutations. The marker of proliferationKi-67 (MKI67) proliferation index and vascular invasion index (obtained bymeasuring D2-40 and CD34) was investigated via immunohistochemistry, andmutations in exons 4-8 of TP53 were measured using direct sequencing.Associations between CD117 and p53 levels or TP53 mutations and clinicalparameters were statistically evaluated. The rates of CD117 or MKI67 positivity, CD117+/TP53 missense mutation+, TP53 missense mutations or recurrence weresignificantly higher in patients with TNBC than in patients with non-TNBC. InTNBC tissues, the presence of CD117 was associated with TP53 missense mutations(P=0.031), vascular invasion, recurrence and MKI67. CD117+/TP53 missensemutation+ also associated with vascular invasion, recurrence and MKI67. Underunivariate analysis, MKI67, vascular invasion, CD117, CD117+/TP53 missensemutation+ and TP53 missense mutations were associated with the overall survivalof patients with TNBC. Multivariate analysis revealed that vascular invasion and CD117+/TP53 missense mutation+ in primary tumors were independent prognosticfactors in patients with TNBC. In conclusion, CD117+/TP53 missense mutation+ was associated with MKI67, vascular invasion and tumor recurrence in TNBC. Thepresence of CD117 and TP53 missense mutations together in the primary tumors was an independent prognostic factor for survival of patients with TNBC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8104 PMCID: PMC5876428PMID: 29616097
