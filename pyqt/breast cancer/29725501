Several FOXPfamilymembers are directly involved during cancer initiation, maintenance andprogression in the adult [5-8]. This may comprise either a pro-oncogenic activityor a deficient tumor-suppressor role, depending upon cell types and associatedsignaling pathways. While FOXP2 is expressed in numerous cell types, itsexpression has been found to be down-regulated in breast cancer [9],hepatocellular carcinoma [8] and gastric cancer biopsies [10]. Conversely,overexpressed FOXP2 has been reported in multiple myelomas, MGUS (MonoclonalGammopathy of Undetermined Significance), several subtypes of lymphomas [5,11],as well as in neuroblastomas [12] and ERG fusion-negative prostate cancers [13]. According to functional evidences reported in breast cancer [9] and survey ofrecent transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of different tumor biopsies, wepostulate that FOXP2 dysregulation may play a main role throughout cancerinitiation and progression. In some cancer conditions, FOXP2 levels are nowconsidered as a critical diagnostic marker of neoplastic cells, and in manysituations, they even bear strong prognostic value [5]. Whether FOXP2 may furtherbecome a therapeutic target is an actively explored lead. Knowledge reviewed heremay help improve our understanding of FOXP2 roles during oncogenesis and provide cues for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic analyses.DOI: 10.18632/genesandcancer.169 PMCID: PMC5931254PMID: 29725501
