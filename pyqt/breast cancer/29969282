(saffron) has been used as a spice and as a medicine for thepast four thousand years. Recently, saffron has been well documented to possessanticancer effects on primary tumors. However studies of its antimetastaticpotential are lacking. The present study is a comparative investigation of theantimetastatic effects of saffron carotenoids, crocin and crocetin, on triplenegative metastatic breast cancer cells (4T1) and their effects on theWnt/β-catenin pathway. It was found that treatment of 4T1 cells with crocin andcrocetin resulted in the inhibition of viability in a dose-dependent manner.Scratch and Transwell chamber assays showed that the nontoxic doses of crocin andcrocetin significantly inhibited migration, cell mobility, and invasion, alsoattenuating adhesion to extracellular matrix. Crocin downregulated mRNAexpression of FZD7, NEDD9, VIM, and VEGF-α genes and upregulated E-CAD. Crocinand crocetin exhibited comparable anti-invasion properties on 4T1 cells. However,crocin and crocetin exerted more pronounced antimigration and antiadhesionpotency, respectively. Furthermore, we showed that the antimetastatic effects of crocin can occur through interfering with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.DOI: 10.1089/dna.2018.4248 PMID: 29969282
