Box 1410, Wroclaw 50-950 , Poland.Designable coordination polymers with suitable chemical diversities andbiocompatible structures have been proposed as a promising class of vehicles for drug delivery systems. Here, we hydrothermally synthesized a novelone-dimensional (1D) coordination polymer,[Zn(H2O)6K2(H2BTC)2(H2O)4](H2BTC)2Â·2H2O, where H3BTC =benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (trimesic acid), cp.1. As the hydrogen bondsstabilized 1D chains in three dimensions, the cp.1 could be a good candidate for delivering small-molecule chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu). Thesynthesized cp.1 showed a remarkable 5-Fu loading of 66% with encapsulationefficiency of 98% and almost complete release process. The 5-Fu-loaded cp.1displayed a time-dependent cytotoxicity effect against breast cancer cell linesMCF-7 and 4T1. The cellular uptake of cp.1 particles was investigated viaconfocal laser scanning microscopy using fluorescein isothiocyanate andLysoTracker Red staining. Furthermore, the in vivo antitumor impact of5-Fu-loaded cp.1 was studied on 4T1 breast cancer BALB/c mice model. Theintratumor treatment of 5-Fu-loaded cp.1 demonstrated beneficial antitumorefficacy by postponing tumor growth. These results suggest that the 5-Fu-loadedcp.1 microparticles with a great locoregional delivery can be efficientanticancer drug carriers for further clinical treatments.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b03111 PMID: 29771107
