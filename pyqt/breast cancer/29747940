Electronic address:romana.netea-maier@radboudumc.nl.Interleukin 32 (IL-32) is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in the development of several diseases, including cancer. IL-32 is a rather peculiar cytokinebecause its protein structure does not show resemblance with any of the knowncytokines, and an IL-32 receptor to facilitate extracellular signaling has notyet been identified. Thus far, 9 isoforms of IL-32 have been described, all ofwhich show differences in terms of effects and in potency to elicit a specificeffect. Since the first report of IL-32 in 2005, there is increasing evidencethat IL-32 plays an important role in the pathophysiology of both hematologicmalignancies and solid tumors. Some IL-32 isoforms have been linked to diseaseoutcome and were shown to positively influence tumor development and progression in various different malignancies, including gastric, breast and lung cancers.However, there are other reports suggesting a tumor suppressive role for some of IL-32 as well. For example, IL-32γ and IL-32β expression is associated withincreased cancer cell death in colon cancer and melanoma, whereas expression ofthese isoforms is associated with increased invasion and migration in breastcancer cells. Furthermore, IL-32 isoforms α, β and γ also play an important role in regulating the anti-tumor immune response, thus also influencing tumorprogression. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of IL-32 and its different isoforms in carcinogenesis, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis andregulation of the anti-tumor immune response.Copyright © 2018.
