[Epub ahead of print]DZ-2384 has a superior preclinical profile to taxanes for the treatment oftriple-negative breast cancer and is synergistic with anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy.Bernier C(1)(2), Soliman A(1)(2), Gravel M(1)(2), Dankner M(2), Savage P(2),Petrecca K(3), Park M(2), Siegel PM(2), Shore GC(1)(2), Roulston A(1)(2).Author information: (1)Laboratory for Therapeutic Development.(2)Department of Biochemistry, Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer ResearchCentre.(3)Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University, Montr√©al, Quebec,Canada.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is typically aggressive, difficult to treat,and commonly metastasizes to the visceral organs and soft tissues, including the lungs and the brain. Taxanes represent the most effective and widely usedtherapeutic class in metastatic TNBC but possess limiting adverse effects thatoften result in a delay, reduction, or cessation of their use. DZ-2384 is acandidate microtubule-targeting agent with a distinct mechanism of action andstrong activity in several preclinical cancer models, with reduced toxicities.DZ-2384 is highly effective in patient-derived taxane-sensitive andtaxane-resistant xenograft models of TNBC at lower doses and over a wider rangerelative to paclitaxel. When comparing compound exposure at minimum effectivedoses relative to safe exposure levels, the therapeutic window for DZ-2384 is14-32 compared with 2.0 and less than 2.8 for paclitaxel and docetaxel,respectively. DZ-2384 is effective at reducing brain metastatic lesions when usedat maximum tolerated doses and is equivalent to paclitaxel. Drug distributionexperiments indicate that DZ-2384 is taken up more efficiently by tumor tissuebut at equivalent levels in the brain compared with paclitaxel. Selective DZ-2384uptake by tumor tissue may in part account for its wider therapeutic windowcompared with taxanes. In view of the current clinical efforts to combinechemotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, we demonstrate that DZ-2384 acts synergistically with anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy in a syngeneic murine model. Theseresults demonstrate that DZ-2384 has a superior pharmacologic profile overcurrently used taxanes and is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic TNBC.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of theCreative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0(CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
