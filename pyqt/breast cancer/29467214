In addition, 25OHD3 undergoes sulfation and glucuronidation in theliver, forming two major conjugative metabolites, 25OHD3-3-O-sulfate (25OHD3-S)and 25OHD3-3-O-glucuronide (25OHD3-G), both of which were detected in human bloodand bile. Considering that the conjugates excreted into the bile may becirculated to and reabsorbed from the intestinal lumen, deconjugated to 25OHD3,and then converted to 1α,25-(OH)2D3, exerting local intestinal cellular effects, it is crucial to characterize enterohepatic transport mechanisms of 25OHD3-S and 25OHD3-G, and thereby understand and predict mechanisms of interindividualvariability in mineral homeostasis. In the present study, with plasma membranevesicle and cell-based transport studies, we showed that 25OHD3-G is a substrate of multidrug resistance proteins 2 and 3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, and that 25OHD3-Sis probably a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein, OATP2B1, andOATP1B3. We also demonstrated sinusoidal and canalicular efflux of bothconjugates using sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes. Given substantialexpression of these transporters in liver hepatocytes and intestinal enterocytes,this study demonstrates for the first time that transporters could play importantroles in the enterohepatic circulation of 25OHD3 conjugates, providing analternative pathway of 25OHD3 delivery to the intestinal tract, which could becritical for vitamin D receptor-dependent gene regulation in enterocytes.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/dmd.117.078881 PMCID: PMC5896369 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29467214
