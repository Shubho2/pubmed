We recently described aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 A1 (ALDH1) positive (+) cells in morphologically normal breast stroma ofpremenopausal women, and the data indicated that their distribution is associatedwith clinical risk factors for breast cancer. The aim of the present study was todefine the identities of these cells using histologic and immunohistologicmethods, and to investigate associations between those cells and hormonal andgenetic risk factors in pre- and postmenopausal women.METHODS: Stroma of morphologically normal tissue was analyzed in samples from 101well-characterized women whose breasts had been operated. Morphology andimmunolabeling were applied to determine cell identities based on the putativestem cell markers ALDH1 and stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA3), andimmunophenotypes indicating mast cells or stellate cells. The results werecompared with the patients' risk factors using regression analysis (two-tailed).RESULTS: ALDH1+ round/oval cells were associated with low parity in BRCA1/2carriers (p = 0.022), while in non-BRCA1/2-carriers they were negativelyassociated with nulliparity (p = 0.057). In premenopausal women ALDH1+ round/ovalcells were associated with family history (p = 0.058). SSEA3+ round/oval cellswere morphologically and immunohistologically consistent with multilineagestress-enduring (Muse) cells, and these cells were independently associated with the breast cancer risk factors low parity (p = 0.015), family history(p = 0.021), and hormone use after menopause (p = 0.032). ALDH1+spindle-shaped/polygonal cells were immunohistologically consistent with stellatecells, and were negatively associated with family history of breast cancer(p = 0.001).CONCLUSION: This study identified novel stromal cell types in benign breasttissue that have a potential for stratifying women for breast cancer risk.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4151-x PMID: 29486751
