However, LVEF is an imperfect parameter and there is a need to find other variables to predict cardiac dysfunction early. Left atrium (LA)enlargement has proven to be a powerful predictor of adverse outcomes in several disease entities.HYPOTHESIS: Baseline LA volume enlargement might predict TZ-related LVdysfunction.METHODS: HER2-positive breast cancer patients receiving TZ and undergoingtransthoracic echocardiography at baseline and at follow-up every 3 months wereretrospectively recruited. One-hundred sixty-two patients formed the studypopulation.RESULTS: Baseline LAVI was dilated in 14 patients (8.6%). Mean follow-up was14 ± 4 months. Cardiotoxicity occurred in 24 patients (14.8%). LAVI was anindependent predictor of TZ-induced LV dysfunction in a clinical model, afteradjustment for age and hypertension (odds ratio per 5-mL/m2 LAVI increase: 1.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.82, P = 0.03); and in a hemodynamic model,including ventricular sizes and systolic blood pressure level (odds ratio per5-mL/m2 LAVI increase: 1.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.81, P = 0.04). Thepredicted probability of developing cardiotoxicity increased progressively, inparallel with LAVI values.CONCLUSIONS: Baseline LA dilatation emerges as a condition associated with thedevelopment of cardiotoxicity in HER2-positive breast cancer patients treatedwith TZ.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/clc.22872 PMID: 29569424
