CSC are often characterized by high aldehydedehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, which is associated with the malignancy of cancer cells and is used for identification and isolation of CSC. Here, we show that thepopulation of ALDH-positive cells in a mouse 4T1 breast tumor model exhibitspronounced circadian alterations. Alterations in the number of ALDH-positivecells were generated by time-dependent increases and decreases in the expression of Aldh3a1 Importantly, circadian clock genes were rhythmically expressed inALDH-negative cells, but not in ALDH-positive cells. Circadian expression ofAldh3a1 in ALDH-positive cells was dependent on the time-dependent release ofWingless-type mmtv integration site family 10a (WNT10a) from ALDH-negative cells.Furthermore, antitumor and antimetastatic effects of ALDH inhibitorN,N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde were enhanced by administration at the time of daywhen ALDH activity was increased in 4T1 tumor cells. Our findings reveal a newrole for the circadian clock within the tumor microenvironment in regulating the circadian dynamics of CSC. These results should enable the development of noveltherapeutic strategies for treatment of TNBC with ALDH inhibitors.Significance:This seminal report reveals that circadian dynamics of CSC are regulated by thetumor microenvironment and provides a proof of principle of its implication forchronotherapy in TNBC.
