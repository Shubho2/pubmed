The presence or absence of receptors on the surface of the tumourcell is associated with the conditional gene expression in the tumour cellitself. Based on these genetically determined expressions of the tumour cell,five molecular subtypes of breast cancer have been classified on the St. GallenInternational Expert Consensus in 2011 that can be immunohistochemicallydetected, with each subtype manifesting certain prognosis and aggression.AIM: Analyzing the presentation of molecular subtypes of breast cancer that areimmunohistochemically detected in surgically treated patients at the Clinic forThoracic and Vascular Surgery.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used the international classification on molecularsubtypes of breast cancer which divides them into: Luminal A (ER+ and/or PR+,HER-2 negative, Ki-67 < 14%), Luminal B with HER-2 negative (ER+ and/or PR+,HER-2 negative, Ki-67 â‰¥ 14%), Luminal B with HER-2 positive (ER+ and/or PR+,HER-2+, any Ki-67), HER-2 enriched (ER-, PR-, HER-2+), and basal-like (triplenegative) (ER-, PR-, HER-2 negative, CK5/6+ and/or EGFR+). A total of 290patients, surgically treated for breast cancer, were analysed during 2014.RESULTS: In our analysis, we found that Luminal A was present in 77 (26.55%)patients, Luminal B HER-2 negative was present in 91 (31.38%) patients, Luminal BHER-2 positive was present in 70 (24.14%) patients, HER-2 enriched was present in25 (8.62%) patients and basal-like (or triple negative) was present in 27 (9.31%)patients.CONCLUSION: Detecting the subtype of breast cancer is important for evaluatingthe prognosis of the disease, but also for determining and providing an adequate therapy. Therefore, determining the subtype of breast cancer is necessary for theroutine histopathological assay.DOI: 10.3889/oamjms.2018.231 PMCID: PMC6026408PMID: 29983785
