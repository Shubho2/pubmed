In the present study, weinvestigated correlations between polymorphisms in FGFR4 and breast cancerprognosis. The FGFR4 SNPs rs1966265 and rs351855 were genotyped in 747 breastcancer patients using the SNaPshot method. FGFR4 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 339 samples. SNP rs351855 was correlated with FGFR4protein expression under dominant and co-dominant models. Lymph node metastasis(LNM), ER (estrogen receptor) status, and molecular subtype were associated with high FGFR4 expression. Univariate analysis revealed rs351855 (CC/CT: P = 0.027,CC/TT: P < 0.001, CC/CT + TT: P = 0.005) to be a prognostic predictor, andmultivariate analysis indicated rs351855 (CC/TT: P = 0.005) to be an independent prognostic factor. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that high FGFR4 protein expression was associated with a poor prognosis. SNP rs351855 was correlated withworse outcomes, with a dose-dependent effect. The results of this study show thatFGFR4 SNP rs351855 is associated with up-regulation of FGFR4 protein expressionand a worse prognosis in breast cancer.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/mc.22819 PMID: 29603419
