The trans activator oftranscription (TAT) modified with polyethylene glycol2000(PEG2000) was conjugatedwith the PMLA backbone which improved the endocytosis of PMLA. PEG5000 wasutilized to shield TAT by a pH-sensitive hydrazone (Hyd) bond. In order todecrease the potential risk of accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon byanti-PEG IgM, the minimal content of TAT for penetrating tumor cells and theoptimal protecting layer density of PEG5000 were screened. The result showed that0.3 mol% TAT was enough to efficiently improve cellular uptake of PMLA (30 kda). The cytotoxicity and the 1H-NMR results indicated that 3.6 mol% PEG5000-modified nanoconjugates could shield 0.3 mol% TAT. The antitumor effect in breast cancercells (MDA-MB-231) in tumor-bearing BALB/C mice demonstrated that thisnanoconjugates exhibits high therapeutic efficiency in artificial solid tumorsand low toxicity to normal tissues. It is indicated that TAT could be hidden inthe long chain of PEG5000 at a neutral pH, when arrival to the tumorextracellular microenvironment, PEG5000 was cleaved from the nanoconjugatesthrough the hydrazone bond due to the acidic tumor environment. Then, TAT wasexposed, allowing the nanoconjugates to be transported into tumor cells. Ourfindings provide important and detailed information regarding the optimal contentof TAT and the shielded density of PEG5000 and reveal their abilities of tumorpenetration and potential for the efficient drug carrier.DOI: 10.1166/jbn.2018.2569 PMID: 29843869
