Digital mammography provides a good quality image withreduced radiation dose and can detect breast carcinoma in its earlier stages,resulting in good prognosis and improved patient survival. Objective To calculatethe diagnostic accuracy of digital mammography in the detection of breast cancer,using histopathology as a gold standard in women aged over 30 years, who areundergoing mammography for screening and diagnostic purposes. Materials andmethods This was a cross-sectional analytical study, conducted in the department of radiology, for a total duration of 10 months. A total of 122 patients ofage above 30 years, referred for digital mammography for the evaluation ofdifferent symptoms related to breast diseases, followed by biopsy/surgery andhistopathology, were included in the study. Result Our data confirmed thatdigital mammography is a highly accurate tool for breast cancer detection having a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 64.5%, a positive predictive value of 89%,and a negative predictive value of 90.9%, with a diagnostic accuracy of 89.3%.Conclusion Considering our results, we recommend that digital mammography should replace screen-film mammography as a basic tool to detect breast cancer for both screening and diagnostic purposes.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2448 PMCID: PMC5991925PMID: 29888152
