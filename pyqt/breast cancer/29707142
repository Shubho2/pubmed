PIK3CAis the most frequent mutated gene in ER-positive early breast cancers, and PIK3CAmutation status is reported to affect activation of AKT and ERα. Moreover, recentstudies demonstrate that patients had a better prognosis when tumors expressedER, androgen receptor (AR), and vitamin D receptor (VDR). In this study, weexamined expression of AR and VDR, phosphorylation of AKT serine (Ser) 473 (AKTphospho-Ser473) and ERα Ser167 (ERα phospho-Ser167) by immunohistochemistry inER-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer. PIK3CA gene mutations were alsodetected in genomic DNA extracted from tumor blocks. Correlations between thesebiological markers, clinicopathological factors and prognosis were analyzed.Levels of AKT phospho-Ser473 were significantly higher in premenopausal womenthan in postmenopausal women. In contrast, AR expression was significantly higherin postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women. PIK3CA mutations weredetected in 47% in premenopausal women and 47% in postmenopausal women.Postmenopausal women with PIK3CA wild-type tumors had significantly worsedisease-free survival than patients with PIK3CA mutant tumors. Low levels of AKT phospho-Ser473 and high levels of ERα phospho-Ser167 were strongly associatedwith increased disease-free survival in postmenopausal women. Evaluation of ERαactivation, in addition to PIK3CA mutation status, might be helpful inidentifying patients who are likely to benefit from endocrine therapy aloneversus those who are not in postmenopausal ER-positive early breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24845 PMCID: PMC5915150PMID: 29707142
