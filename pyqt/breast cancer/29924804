We report generation of reporter systems driven by eitherkeratin-14 (K14) or keratin-8 (K8) promoter that not only express a fluorescentprotein but also an inducible suicide gene. Transgenic mice express the reporter genes in the right cell compartments of mammary gland epithelia and respond totreatment with toxins. In addition, we engineered the reporters into 4T1metastatic mouse tumor cell line and demonstrate that K14+ cells, but not K14- orK8+, are both highly invasive in three-dimensional (3D) culture and metastatic invivo. Treatment of cells in culture, or tumors in mice, with reporter-targetingtoxin inhibited both invasive behavior and metastasis in vivo. RNA sequencing(RNA-seq), secretome, and epigenome analysis of K14+ and K14- cells led to theidentification of amphoterin-induced protein 2 (Amigo2) as a new cell invasiondriver whose expression correlated with decreased relapse-free survival inpatients with TP53 wild-type (WT) breast cancer.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.2004049 PMCID: PMC6042798PMID: 29924804
