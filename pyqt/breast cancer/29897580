Advances are beingmade broadly and in focused aspects. Selected topics are presented for theirdevelopments since publication of the most recent MEN1 consensus guidelines 6years ago.Methods: Topics were selected for clinical impact or broad interest or both. For each topic, information was obtained from original reports and reviews.Results: The selected topics are as follows: tumor behavior and breast cancer in MEN1; foregut neuroectoderm tumor screening, biomarkers periodically to detecttumor emergence of foregut neuroectoderm tumors, 68Ga dotatate positron emission tomography/computed tomography for pancreatic and duodenal neuroectodermal tumor imaging, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor scintigraphy for insulinoma;therapy, the size of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) as one criterion forsurgery, minimally invasive surgery of pancreatic NETs, and 177Lu dotatatetherapy; MEN1 gene, the search for the MEN1/menin pathway and MEN1 or GCM2mutation in familial isolated hyperparathyroidism, and MEN1 mutation-positive vs mutation-negative cases of MEN1 are different.Conclusions: MEN1 topics are a rich and fast-moving area. Important highlightsstand out, and major and rapid advances will continue into the near future.DOI: 10.1210/jc.2017-02340 PMID: 29897580
