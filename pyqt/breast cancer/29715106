Decrease in the ratio ofphosphorylated (p-)AKT to AKT in response to trastuzumab was more profound inPIK3CA-wt cells than in PIK3CA-mt cells in 3D culture, while the differencebetween PIK3CA genotypes was less apparent in 2D culture. Treatment with BKM120and trastuzumab resulted in a stronger increase in cleaved PARP than eithertreatment alone.CONCLUSION: 3D Culture appears to better represent trastuzumab-induced apoptosis and resistance to trastuzumab associated with PIK3CA mutation.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12528 PMID: 29715106  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
