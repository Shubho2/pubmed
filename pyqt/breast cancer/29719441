In the past, hormonal treatment consisted only ofthe estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, associated with luteinizinghormone-releasing hormone (lhrh); more recently, aromatase inhibitors (ais) have come into widespread use. The ais interfere with the last enzymatic step ofestrogen synthesis in which androgens are converted into estrogens. Initially,the ais were used alone in postmenopausal patients to prevent disease recurrence,but together with lhrh analogs, they can be used in premenopausal patients toproduce better estrogen suppression than can be achieved with tamoxifen plus alhrh analog. Using a systematic review of the scientific literature (prospective and retrospective studies), we set out to assess the efficacy of ais comparedwith other endocrine therapy in various disease settings (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, metastatic).DOI: 10.3747/co.25.3735 PMCID: PMC5927796PMID: 29719441
