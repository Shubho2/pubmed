We report a complex case ofPCT in a 67-year-old woman with an unusual constellation of cutaneous findings:scleroderma, acquired ichthyosis, and nonscarring alopecia. Possible triggers forher PCT include tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer and carrier status of thehemochromatosis gene. High-dose chloroquine was used to successfully achieveclinical remission and normalize her uroporphyrins. While on chloroquine shedeveloped extensive classic vitiligo. It is not clear if this is another feature of her complex and unusual PCT, or a consequence of her antimalarial therapy.DOI: 10.1159/000488899 PMCID: PMC6006631PMID: 29928199
