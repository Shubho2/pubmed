How the NLRP3 inflammasome is negatively regulated is poorly understood. Here we show that NLRP3 inflammasome activation issuppressed by sumoylation. NLRP3 is sumoylated by the SUMO E3-ligase MAPL, andstimulation-dependent NLRP3 desumoylation by the SUMO-specific proteases SENP6and SENP7 promotes NLRP3 activation. Defective NLRP3 sumoylation, either by NLRP3mutation of SUMO acceptor lysines or depletion of MAPL, results in enhancedcaspase-1 activation and IL-1β release. Conversely, depletion of SENP7 suppressesNLRP3-dependent ASC oligomerisation, caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release.These data indicate that sumoylation of NLRP3 restrains inflammasome activation, and identify SUMO proteases as potential drug targets for the treatment ofinflammatory diseases.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05321-2 PMCID: PMC6070540PMID: 30069026
