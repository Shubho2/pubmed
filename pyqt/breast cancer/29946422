This situation calls for building new tools or extending existing ones with the ability toimport biological pathways previously deposited in databases and analyze them, inorder to produce novel biological insights at the pathway level. Results: We haveextended a network simulation tool (BioNSi), which now allows merging of multiplepathways from the KEGG pathway database into a single, coherent network, andvisualizing its properties. Furthermore, the enhanced tool enables loadingexperimental expression data into the network and simulating its dynamics undervarious biological conditions or perturbations. As a proof of concept, we tested two sets of published experimental data, one related to inflammatory boweldisease condition and the other to breast cancer treatment. We predict some ofthe major observations obtained following these laboratory experiments, andprovide new insights that may shed additional light on these results. Toolrequirements: Cytoscape 3.x, JAVA 8 Availability: The tool is freely available athttp://bionsi.wix.com/bionsi, where a complete user guide and a step-by-stepmanual can also be found.DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.13254.2 PMCID: PMC6008849PMID: 29946422
