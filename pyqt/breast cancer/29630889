The data sources for use of the drugs were amailed medication use questionnaire in 2013 and linked Medicare Part D claimsfiles from 2010-2014. Estimated breast cancer risk within 5 years was assessedwith the use of the modified Gail model and self-reported breast cancer riskfactors; comorbidities were assessed through a questionnaire.RESULTS: A total of 22,235 women completed the medication use questionnaire; ofthese, 13,640 women (61%) had linked Part D data. In 2013, 45% of the women were 65-74 years old, and 55% of the women were 75-84 years old. From the medicationuse questionnaire, raloxifene use (past month) was 1.8%, 2.5%, and 4.0% for womenwith breast cancer risk within 5 years of <1.66%, 1.66-3.0%, and ≥3%,respectively (probability value trend, <.0001). From Part D, for any use duringthe period among women with coverage, raloxifene rates were 3.3%, 4.0%, and 6.6% for the 3 categories for breast cancer risk within 5 years (probability valuetrend, <.0001); use was 7.4% and 3.3% in women with and without osteoporosis,respectively. Raloxifene use significantly decreased from 2010-2014, andspecifically from 2012-2014, both for all women and for women with breast cancer risk within 5 years of ≥3%. Tamoxifen use from Part D was 0.36%, 0.45%, and 0.85%for the 3 categories for breast cancer risk within 5 years (probability valuetrend, .009).CONCLUSION: Raloxifene use was low overall but increased modestly with breastcancer risk, and usage decreased from 2010-2014. Tamoxifen use was very low.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.ajog.2018.03.031 PMCID: PMC5970073 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29630889
