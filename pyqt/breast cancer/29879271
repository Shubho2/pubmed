Alimited body of evidence also suggests that cancer can increase the risk ofdeveloping new cases of diabetes, but the evidence is inconclusive.Objective: To evaluate whether the development of cancer is associated withincreasing risk of subsequent diabetes.Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included a nationallyrepresentative sample of the Korean general population observed for up to 10years (January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2013). A total of 524 089 men and women20 to 70 years of age without diabetes and with no history of cancer at baseline were included.Exposures: Incident cancer (time-varying exposure).Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident type 2 diabetes using insurance claim codes.Results: During 3 492 935.6 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up, 7.0years) in 494 189 individuals (50.0% female; mean [SD] age, 41.8 [12.5] years),15 130 participants developed cancer and 26 610 participants developed diabetes. After adjustment for age, sex, precancer diabetes risk factors, metabolicfactors, and comorbidities, the hazard ratio (HR) for diabetes associated withcancer development was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.26-1.45; P < .001). The excess risk fordiabetes was highest in the first 2 years after cancer diagnosis, but it remainedelevated throughout follow-up. By cancer type, development of pancreatic (HR,5.15; 95% CI, 3.32-7.99), kidney (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.34-3.16), liver (HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.50-2.54), gallbladder (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.08-2.98), lung (HR, 1.74;95% CI, 1.34-2.24), blood (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.07-2.43), breast (HR, 1.60; 95%CI, 1.27-2.01), stomach (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.16-1.58), and thyroid cancer (HR,1.33; 95% CI, 1.12-1.59) was associated with a significantly increased risk ofdiabetes.Conclusions and Relevance: In this large Korean cohort, cancer developmentincreased the risk of subsequent diabetes. These data provide evidence thatcancer is associated with an increased risk of diabetes in cancer survivorsindependent of traditional diabetes risk factors. Physicians should remember thatpatients with cancer develop other clinical problems, such as diabetes, withhigher frequency than individuals without cancer, and should consider routinediabetes screening in these patients.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.1684 PMID: 29879271
