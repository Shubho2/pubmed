[Epub ahead of print]Change of paradigm in treating elderly with breast cancer: are we undertreatingelderly patients?Baban CK(1), Devane L(2), Geraghty J(2).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin 4, Ireland.chwanrowkarimbaban@rcsi.ie.(2)Department of Surgery, St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin 4, Ireland.Developed countries face significant population ageing in the near future. Within20 years, the average age will approach 50 years and the largest populationcohort will be those over 65 years. The incidence of breast cancer increases withage, with a risk in women of 0.44% by the age of 30, 3.82% by the age of 70 and10% by the age of 80. Breast cancer is responsible for one out of every threecancer-related deaths. Elderly patients have higher mortality rates and mostbreast cancer-related deaths are observed in women over 65. There appears to be atrend that elderly patients with breast cancer receive less than the standardtreatment compared to younger counterparts and this leads to poorer outcomes. Therationale for treating elderly breast cancer patients more conservatively is thatbreast cancers in this cohort are more commonly oestrogen receptor (ER) positive which gives the clinician the option to treat with hormonal manipulation alone.In addition, elderly patients present at a later stage compared to youngerpatients who frequently present with early (stages I and II) breast cancer. This review aims to give an overview of the diagnosis, treatment options andsurveillance of breast cancer in elderly women (over 75 years) and to discuss thechange in perception of the term 'elderly' and the reasons for undertreatment in the elderly patients.DOI: 10.1007/s11845-018-1851-9 PMID: 29934872
