For establishedrisk factors, we estimated the percent of the total risk factor association with breast cancer that was mediated by percent MD (secondarily, by dense area andnon-dense area) for invasive breast cancer as well as for subtypes defined by theestrogen receptor (ER+/ER-), progesterone receptor (PR+/PR-), and HER2(HER2+/HER2-). Analyses were conducted separately in pre- and postmenopausalwomen.RESULTS: Positive associations between prior breast biopsy and risk of invasivebreast cancer as well as all subtypes were partially mediated by percent MD inpre- and postmenopausal women (percent mediated = 11-27%, p ≤ 0.02). Inpostmenopausal women, nulliparity and hormone therapy use were positivelyassociated with invasive, ER+ , PR+ , and HER2- breast cancer; percent MDpartially mediated these associations (percent mediated ≥ 31%, p ≤ 0.02).Further, among postmenopausal women, percent MD partially mediated the positiveassociation between later age at first birth and invasive as well as ER+ breastcancer (percent mediated = 16%, p ≤ 0.05).CONCLUSION: Percent MD partially mediated the associations between breast biopsy,nulliparity, age at first birth, and hormone therapy with risk of breast cancer, particularly among postmenopausal women, suggesting that these risk factors atleast partially influence breast cancer risk through changes in breast tissuecomposition.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4735-9 PMCID: PMC5994184 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29502324
