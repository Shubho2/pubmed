Tumor sampleswere collected from both the primary and metastatic sites of non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma from patients in locations worldwide, andthese were submitted to Caris Life Sciences for tumor multiplatform analysis,including gene sequencing (Sanger and next-generation sequencing with a targeted 47-gene panel), protein expression (assayed by immunohistochemistry), and geneamplification (assayed by in situ hybridization). The data analysis considereddifferential protein expression, gene amplification, and mutations among brainmetastases, extracranial metastases, and primary tumors. The analyzed population included: 16,999 unmatched primary tumor and/or metastasis samples: 8178non-small cell lung cancers (5098 primaries; 2787 systemic metastases; 293 brain metastases), 7064 breast cancers (3496 primaries; 3469 systemic metastases; 99brain metastases), and 1757 melanomas (660 primaries; 996 systemic metastases;101 brain metastases). TOP2A expression was increased in brain metastases fromall 3 cancers, and brain metastases overexpressed multiple proteins clusteringaround functions critical to DNA synthesis and repair and implicated inchemotherapy resistance, including RRM1, TS, ERCC1, and TOPO1. cMET wasoverexpressed in melanoma brain metastases relative to primary skin specimens.Brain metastasis patients may particularly benefit from therapeutic targeting of enzymes associated with DNA synthesis, replication, and/or repair.
