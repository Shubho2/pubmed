Neither liposomal DOX nor pegylated liposomal DOX are able tocompletely resolve this issue. This is a proof-of-concept study testingaptamer-drug conjugate (ApDC) targeted delivery systems for chemotherapeuticdrugs.Methods: Aptamer library targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 3(HER3) was screened and affinity was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay. Specificity was tested in MCF-7HER3-high, BT474HER3-high, and293THER3-negative cells using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. We further developed a HER3 aptamer-functionalized liposome encapsulating DOX and theefficiency of this ApDC was detected by cellular uptake analysis and cellviability assay. In MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice, tumor targeting evaluation,efficacy, toxicity and preliminary pharmocokinetic study was performed.Results: The candidate #13 aptamer had highest affinity (Kd =98Â±9.7 nM) andspecificity. ApDC effectively reduces the half maximal inhibitory concentrationof DOX compared with lipsome-DOX and free DOX. In vivo imaging and preliminarydistribution studies showed that actively targeted nanoparticles, such asApt-Lip-DOX molecules, could facilitate the delivery of DOX into tumors inMCF-7-bearing mice. This targeted chemotherapy caused greater tumor suppressionthan other groups and alleviated side effects such as weight loss, low survivalrate, and organ (heart and liver) injury demonstrated by H&E staining.Conclusion: The results indicate that targeted chemotherapy using theaptamer-drug conjugate format could provide better tolerability and efficacycompared with non-targeted delivery in relatively low-dose toxic drugs.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S149887 PMCID: PMC5804143PMID: 29440899  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
