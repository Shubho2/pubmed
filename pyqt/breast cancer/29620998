Malone, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.Purpose The Women's Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE)study demonstrated the importance of breast cancer family history oncontralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk, even for noncarriers of deleteriousBRCA1/2 mutations. With the completion of WECARE II, updated risk estimates arereported. Additional analyses that exclude women negative for deleteriousmutations in ATM, CHEK2*1100delC, and PALB2 were performed. Patients and Methods The WECARE Study is a population-based case-control study that compared 1,521 CBCcases with 2,212 individually matched unilateral breast cancer (UBC) controls.Participants were younger than age 55 years when diagnosed with a first invasive breast cancer between 1985 and 2008. Women were interviewed about breast cancerrisk factors, including family history. A subset of women was screened fordeleterious mutations in BRCA1/2, ATM, CHEK2*1100delC, and PALB2. Rate ratios(RRs) were estimated using multivariable conditional logistic regression.Cumulative absolute risks (ARs) were estimated by combining RRs from the WECAREStudy and population-based SEER*Stat cancer incidence data. Results Women withany first-degree relative with breast cancer had a 10-year AR of 8.1% for CBC(95% CI, 6.7% to 9.8%). Risks also were increased if the relative was diagnosedat an age younger than 40 years (10-year AR, 13.5%; 95% CI, 8.8% to 20.8%) orwith CBC (10-year AR, 14.1%; 95% CI, 9.5% to 20.7%). These risks are comparablewith those seen in BRCA1/2 deleterious mutation carriers (10-year AR, 18.4%; 95% CI, 16.0% to 21.3%). In the subset of women who tested negative for deleteriousmutations in BRCA1/2, ATM, CHEK2*1100delC, and PALB2, estimates were unchanged.Adjustment for known breast cancer single-nucleotide polymorphisms did not affectestimates. Conclusion Breast cancer family history confers a high CBC risk, even after excluding women with deleterious mutations. Clinicians are urged to usedetailed family histories to guide treatment and future screening decisions foryoung women with breast cancer.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.77.3424 PMCID: PMC5959199 [Available on 2019-05-20]PMID: 29620998
