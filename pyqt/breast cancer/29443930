A total of 5224 cancer survivors, 19,926 non-cancer individualswithout comorbidities (non-cancer I), and 20,622 non-cancer individuals withcomorbidities, matched by age, gender, and recruitment center location wereincluded in the analysis. Generally, the proportion of total energy fromcarbohydrates was higher and the proportion from fat was lower in cancersurvivors. The odds ratios (ORs) for total energy (OR = 0.92, 95% confidenceinterval (CI) = 0.86-0.99), proportion of total energy from fat (OR = 0.54, 95%CI = 0.35-0.83), and protein (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.79-0.90) were significantlylower, and the OR for the proportion of total energy from carbohydrates washigher (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.10-1.33) in the cancer survivors than in non-cancerI. Additionally, the cancer survivors' protein, vitamin B₁, vitamin B₂, niacin,and phosphorus intakes were lower, whereas their vitamin C intake was higher.When divided by cancer type, the ORs for the carbohydrate percentages weresignificantly higher in the colon and breast cancer survivors, whereas proteinintake was lower in gastric, breast, and cervical cancer survivors. The nutrient intake patterns in Asian cancer survivors are poor, with higher carbohydrate and lower fat and protein intakes.DOI: 10.3390/nu10020212 PMCID: PMC5852788PMID: 29443930
