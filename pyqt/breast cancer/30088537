The most common histological type wasinvasive ductal carcinoma (93.75%), and the most common differentiation grade was2 (62.5%). Overall, 153 lymph nodes were identified, with a mean of 2.39/case.Thirty-four lymph nodes tested positive for malignancy by imprint cytology, and55 tested positive by histology. Of the 55 positive lymph nodes, 41 (74.5%)involved macrometastases, and 14 (25.5%) involved micrometastases. There were 21 false negatives with imprint cytology, namely, 7 for macrometastases and 14 formicrometastases, resulting in a rate of 17.6%. The sensitivity of imprintcytology was 61.8%, with a specificity and positive predictive value of 100%, anegative predictive value of 82.4% and an accuracy of 86.3%. The method presentednull sensitivity for the identification of micrometastases.CONCLUSIONS: The false-negative rate with imprint cytology was associated withthe number of sentinel lymph nodes obtained. The rate found for complete responseto neoadjuvant chemotherapy was comparable to the rates reported in theliterature. The accuracy of imprint cytology was good, and its specificity wasexcellent for sentinel lymph node detection; however, the method was unable todetect lymph node micrometastases.DOI: 10.6061/clinics/2018/e363 PMCID: PMC6038057PMID: 30088537
