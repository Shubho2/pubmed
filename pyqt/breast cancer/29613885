It has been estimated that by the year 2030, worldwide 1.2 billion women will be menopausal. The mostbothersome symptoms of menopause are believed to be due to declines in estrogenlevels in postmenopausal women. Thus, hormone therapy is an effective treatmentoption for menopausal women, although prolonged use of hormone therapy isassociated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer, thromboembolism, and stroke. A literature search for studies evaluating the effects of hormone therapyin menopausal women with asymptomatic fibroids demonstrated variable effects ofhormone therapy on the volume and size of the fibroids. Some studies havedemonstrated an increase in size of pre-existing asymptomatic fibroids andformation of new fibroids with higher doses of progestogen in combinationtherapy. The finding of low resistance index in uterine arteries of women withasymptomatic fibroids is associated with an increased risk of fibroid growth, andthus making the measurement of pulsatility index of uterine arteries a possiblescreening tool before initiating hormone therapy in menopausal women withfibroids. Although the effect of hormone treatment is variable and statistically insignificant in many cases, the newer selective estrogen receptor modulatorshaving tissue-specific estrogen agonistic and antagonistic actions such asraloxifene have a favorable clinical profile and may be better alternatives inwomen with asymptomatic fibroids.DOI: 10.1097/GME.0000000000001105 PMID: 29613885
