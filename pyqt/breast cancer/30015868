China.Evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are vital in cell growth, migration,and invasion by inhibiting their target genes. A previous study demonstrated thatmiRNA (miR)-155‑3p and miR‑155-5p exerted opposite effects on cell proliferation,apoptosis, migration and invasion in breast cancer cell lines. An miRNAmicroarray was used to show that miR‑155‑3p was downregulated whereas miR‑155-5p was upregulated in paclitaxel-resistant (PR) cells compared with parental breast cancer cells. However, the role of miR‑155 in breast cancer cell invasion andmetastasis remains to be elucidated. A 21-residue peptide derived from the viral macrophage inﬂammatory protein II (NT21MP), competes with the ligand of CXCchemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and its ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1α,inducing cell apoptosis in breast cancer. The present study aimed to identify theunderlying mechanism of action of miR‑155‑3p/5p and NT21MP in PR breast cancercells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, wound-healing,cell cycle and apoptosis assays, and Cell Counting kit-8 assay were used toachieve this goal. The combined overexpression of miR‑155‑3p with NT21MPdecreased the migration and invasion ability and increased the number ofapoptotic and arrested cells in the G0/G1 phase transition in vitro. Theknockdown of miR‑155-5p combined with NT21MP had a similar effect on PR breastcancer cells. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of their target gene myeloiddifferentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) or tumor protein 53-inducednuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1) combined with NT21MP enhanced the sensitivity of thebreast cancer cells to paclitaxel. Taken together, these findings suggested that miR‑155‑3p/5p and their target genes MYD88 and TP53INP1 may serve as novelbiomarkers for NT21MP therapy through the CXCR4 pathway for improving sensitivityto paclitaxel in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4477 PMCID: PMC6065429PMID: 30015868
