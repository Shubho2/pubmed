We surveyed a population-based cohort of older breast cancersurvivors to assess the association of local therapy with long-termquality-of-life outcomes.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used nationally comprehensive Medicare claims toidentify women aged ≥67 years in whom nonmetastatic breast cancer was diagnosedin 2009, who were treated with 1 of the 5 aforementioned treatment options, andwho were still alive in 2015. From this cohort, 1650 patients (330 patients pertreatment) were randomly selected. A survey that included the CanSORT (CancerSurveillance and Outcomes Research Team) Satisfaction with Breast CosmeticOutcome, BREAST-Q, Decisional Regret Scale, and EQ-5D-3L was mailed to potential participants. We used multivariable linear regression to assess associationsbetween local therapy and outcomes after adjusting for patient, disease, andtreatment covariates.RESULTS: Among the 489 women who returned the surveys (30% response rate), themedian age at diagnosis was 72 years (range, 67-87 years). The interval fromdiagnosis to survey completion was approximately 6 years for all patients.Compared with Lump + WBI (adjusted score, 3.40), the CanSORT cosmeticsatisfaction scores were higher for Lump + Brachy (score, 3.77; P = .007) andLump alone (score, 3.80; P = .04) and lower for Mast + RT (score, 3.01; P =.006). Similar trends were seen for BREAST-Q cosmetic satisfaction. BREAST-Qpsychosocial, sexual, and physical well-being and EQ-5D-3L global health statustended to be better in patients treated with less irradiation and lesssurgery. BREAST-Q adverse radiation effects were worse for Lump + WBI comparedwith Lump + Brachy. Decisional regret regarding surgery and radiation therapy didnot differ across groups. Compared with patients treated with Lump + WBI,patients treated with Lump + Brachy and Lump alone reported slightly higher ratesof in-breast recurrence (excess risk of 5.8% and 6.4%, respectively; P = .01).CONCLUSIONS: In this nationally diverse cohort, less irradiation and less surgerywere associated with better long-term quality-of-life outcomes. However, patient regret regarding surgery and radiation therapy was similar across all groups.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.
