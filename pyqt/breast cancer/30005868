Although mostthyroid cancer can be cured with surgery, radioactive iodine, and/orchemotherapy, thyroid cancers still recur and may become chemoresistant.Autophagy is a complex self-degradative process that plays a dual role in cancer development and progression. In this study, we found that miR-125b wasdownregulated in tissue samples of thyroid cancer as well as in thyroid cancercell lines, and the expression of Foxp3 was upregulated. Further, we demonstratedthat miR-125b could directly act on Foxp3 by binding to its 3' UTR and inhibitthe expression of Foxp3. A negative relationship between miR-125b and Foxp3 wasthus revealed. Overexpression of miR-125b markedly sensitized thyroid cancercells to cisplatin treatment by inducing autophagy through an Atg7 pathwayin vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which miR-125b has the potential to negatively regulate Foxp3 to promoteautophagy and enhance the efficacy of cisplatin in thyroid cancer. miR-125 may beof therapeutic significance in thyroid cancer.Copyright © 2018 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.
