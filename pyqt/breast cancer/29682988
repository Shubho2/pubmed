Inthis cross-sectional study, women of childbearing age who had been diagnosed withbreast cancer completed a face-to-face survey that included demographic, disease,and symptom-related data, and social support and fertility intention information.The mean fertility intention score among the 223 participants was "medium" ( M ± SD = 41.18 ± 12.62). Higher symptom severity, especially for distress, wasrelated to lower fertility intention. Instrumental support from families andfriends was positively associated with fertility intention score. Younger womenhad better fertility intention scores than older women. The Sobel test showedthat age mediated menopause and fertility intention. The findings offer theevidence of the needs to control symptoms and provide sufficient instrumentalsupport regarding fertility after completing chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1177/1054773818770814 PMID: 29682988
