Triazinone derivatives 4c, 5e and 7c show potent anticancer activity overMCF-7 breast cancer cells higher than podophyllotoxin (podo) by approximate6-fold. DNA flow cytometry analysis for the compounds 3c, 4c, 5e, 6c and 7c show a potent inhibitory activity of cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Compounds 4c, 5e and 7c exhibit low to moderate β-tubulin polymerizationinhibition percentage. Meanwhile, compound 6c displayed excellent β-tubulinpercentage of polymerization inhibition equivalent to that exhibited by podo. In addition, compounds 4c, 5e and 7c show strong topoisomerase (topo) II inhibitory activity in nano-molar concentration, compared to known topo inhibitor asetoposide. Finally, apoptotic inducing activity over MCF-7 of compounds 4c, 5e,6c and 7c is due to up-regulation of p53, increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio andcaspase3/7 levels 2-fold higher than podo.Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.07.003 PMID: 30025350
