Patients treated with the antidiabetic drugmetformin for diabetes or metabolic syndrome have reduced breast cancer risk, agreater pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant therapy, and improved breast cancer survival. We hypothesized that metformin may be especially effective when targeted to the menopausal transition, as this is a lifecycle window when weight gain and metabolic syndrome increase, and is also when the risk forobesity-related breast cancer increases.METHODS: Here, we used an 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced mammary tumor rat model of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive postmenopausal breast cancer to evaluatethe long-term effects of metformin administration on metabolic and tumorendpoints. In this model, ovariectomy (OVX) induces rapid weight gain, and animpaired whole-body response to excess calories contributes to increased tumorglucose uptake and increased tumor proliferation. Metformin treatment wasinitiated in tumor-bearing animals immediately prior to OVX and maintained forthe duration of the study.RESULTS: Metformin decreased the size of existing mammary tumors and inhibitednew tumor formation without changing body weight or adiposity. Decreased lipidaccumulation in the livers of metformin-treated animals supports the ability ofmetformin to improve overall metabolic health. We also found a decrease in thenumber of aromatase-positive, CD68-positive macrophages within the tumormicroenvironment, suggesting that metformin targets the immune microenvironmentin addition to improving whole-body metabolism.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that peri-menopause/menopause represents aunique window of time during which metformin may be highly effective in womenwith established, or at high risk for developing, breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0974-2 PMCID: PMC6000949PMID: 29898754
