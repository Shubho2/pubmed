However, the expression levels of the IDH protein and their biological function in humanbreast cancer remain largely unknown.METHODS: In this study, the clinical impact of IDH1 expression on the progressionand prognosis of breast cancer was evaluated using immunohistochemistry assay(IHC) of the corresponding tumor-adjacent normal, ductal carcinoma in situ(DCIS), and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tissues from 309 patients with breastductal carcinoma. The relationship between microRNA (miRNA) and IDH1 wereexamined by a bioinformatics approach, western blot and reporter assay. Thebiological functions of IDH1 were examined in breast cancer cells with IDH1knockdown, including proliferation, migration and invasion.RESULTS: The present findings revealed that the mRNA and protein expressionlevels of IDH1 were both significantly lower in breast cancer tissues than inadjacent normal tissues. A low expression level of IDH1 in breast cancersignificantly correlated with advanced stage (p = 0.012), lymph node metastasis(p = 0.018), and poor disease-specific survival (DSS) (adjusted hazard ratio(AHR), 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-2.30; p = 0.02). Furthermore,oncogenic miR-32 and miR-92b were identified to suppress IDH1 expression, leadingto the inhibition of cell migration and invasion. We further explored whetherreduced expression of IDH1 significantly increases snail expression by activatingHIFα (hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha) and NFκB (nuclear factor kappa B)signaling. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the combination of low IDH1 and high snail expression could be an independent risk factor forshorter DSS (AHR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.32-4.16; p = 0.004) and shorter disease-freesurvival (AHR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.39-4.50; p = 0.002) in patients with breastcancer.CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that a IDH1low/Snailhigh molecular signaturecould serve as an independent biomarker for poor prognosis in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0953-7 PMCID: PMC5902927PMID: 29661250
