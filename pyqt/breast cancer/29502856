Differences in pathological features, loco-regional therapy, disease-freesurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.RESULTS: Patients with palpable tumors were older, had larger tumors, and higher rates of lymph-node involvement. The tumors were more likely to be poorlydifferentiated, of high nuclear grade, and display lymphovascular invasion. Aftermean followup of 59 months, DFS and OS were significantly lower for palpable thannonpalpable tumors (DFS 93.5% vs. 98.4%, p < 0.001, OS 88.5% vs. 95.6%,p < 0.001). Controlling for age, size and nodal status, palpability was anindependent factor for DFS (OR = 2.56; 95%CI, 1.37-4.79, p = 0.003) and OS(OR = 2.12; 95%CI, 1.38-3.28, p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: In a group of hormone-sensitive, mostly postmenopausal early-stagebreast cancer patients, palpable tumors were more likely to have more aggressive features and metastatic potential, which translated in to a higher incidence ofbreast cancer-related events and worse overall survival.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
