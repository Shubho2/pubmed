Electronic address:ana.pizarro@imdea.org.Gold(III) compounds have received increasing attention in cancer research. Three gold complexes of general formula [AuIIIL]Cl, where L is benzilbis(thiosemicarbazonate), compound 1, benzil bis(4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazonate),compound 2, or benzil bis(4-cyclohexyl-3-thiosemicarbazonate), compound 3, havebeen synthesized and fully characterized, including the X-ray crystal structureof compound 3, confirming square-planar geometry around the gold(III) centre.Compound 1 showed moderate cytotoxicity and accumulation in MCF7 breast cancercells but did not inhibit thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity and did notinduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Compound 2, the least cytotoxic,was found to be capable of modestly inhibiting TrxR activity and produced lowlevels of ROS in the MCF7 cell line. The most cytotoxic compound, 3, had thehighest cellular accumulation and its distribution pattern showed a clearpreference for the cytosol and mitochondria of MCF7 cells. It readily hamperedintracellular TrxR activity leading to a dramatic alteration of the cellularredox state and to the induction of cell death.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
