Email: roberta_pitta@hotmail.comObjective: To compare a complex physical therapy (CPT) protocol alone or combinedwith complex physical therapy muscle more strength training (CPT+ST) in patients with lymphedema after breast cancer treatment regarding strength and limb muscle volume. Methods: In this controlled clinical trial, consecutive patients treated from breast cancer from April 2014 to December 2015 were allocated in two groups,the CPT group 1 and the CPT+ST group 2, that performed CPT associated with musclestrengthening. Patients in the CPT group 1 received the routine protocol of care,consisting of manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), multilayer bandage compressiontherapy, skin care and regular exercises. Patients CPT+ST performed, 2 sets of 10repetitions exercises at 40% of maximal voluntary contraction the first week,increasing to 3 sets with 10 repetitions during the second and third weeks, 3sets with 15 repetitions, for 8 weeks, 50 minutes per session, twice per week.Strength and muscle volume were analyzed. Result: In the study period, 42patients were enrolled, 22 in the CPT group 1 and 20 in the CPT+ST group 2. Only 36 completed treatment. Both groups showed similar increases in the range ofmovement in: shoulder flexion, extension, adduction, abduction and externalrotation. Internal rotation showed less improvement in CPT+ST group 2 (p =0,034). Strength improvement was similar between groups. The CPT+ST group 2seemed to have a greater volume in the upper limb when compared to CPT group 1,but it was not possible to prove any significant difference (p = 0.555).Conclusion: There was no difference of muscular limb volume between the twointerventions. This means that strengthening exercises can be performed bypatients with lymphedema safely, without the risk of increasing upper limb volumewith edema.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.5.1405 PMCID: PMC6031824PMID: 29802707
