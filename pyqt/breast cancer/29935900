Electronic address: abrahaj5@ccf.org.Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors have advanced the treatment ofmetastatic breast cancer by targeting the cell cycle machinery, interruptingintracellular and mitogenic hormone signals that stimulate proliferation ofmalignant cells. Preclinical evidence demonstrated that derangements of cyclinD1, CDK4/6, and retinoblastoma expression are common in breast cancer, andsuggested a therapeutic benefit from interrupting this axis required for cellcycle progression. Studies of cell lines and animal models of breast cancer have demonstrated the complex interplay between the cell cycle and estrogen receptorand human epidermal growth receptor 2 signaling, which informs our understanding of synergistic use of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy, as well asmechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy. Interestingly, estrogen receptoractivity leads to upregulation of cyclin D1 expression, but the estrogen receptoris also in turn activated by cyclin D1, independent of estrogen binding. EarlyCDK inhibitors were nonspecific and limited by systemic toxicities, while thecurrent generation of CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown promise in the treatment ofhormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Preclinical investigations of the three CDK4/6 inhibitors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (palbociclib,ribociclib, and abemaciclib) lend further insight into their mechanism of action,which will hopefully inform the future use and refinement of these therapies.Finally, we summarize evidence for additional novel CDK4/6 inhibitors currentlyin development.Copyright Â© 2017.
