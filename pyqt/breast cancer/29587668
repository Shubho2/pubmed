Overexpression of COX-2 has been found in a majority of breastcarcinomas, and has also been associated with increased severity and thedevelopment of the metastasis. Our lab recently demonstrated that COX-2 can also metabolize dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA, a precursor of ω-6 arachidonic acid) toproduce an anti-cancer byproduct, 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid (8-HOA) that can inhibitgrowth and migration of colon and pancreatic cancer cells. We thus tested whetherour strategy of knocking down delta-5-desaturase (D5D, the key enzyme thatconverts DGLA to arachidonic acid) in breast cancer cells overexpressing COX-2can also be used to promote 8-HOA formation, thereby suppressing cancer growth,migration, and invasion.METHODS: SiRNA and shRNA transfection were used to knock down D5D expression inMDA-MB 231 and 4 T1 cells (human and mouse breast cancer cell lines expressinghigh COX-2, respectively). Colony formation assay, FITC Annexin V/PI doublestaining, wound healing and transwell assay were used to assess the effect of ourstrategy on inhibition of cancer growth, migration, and invasion. GC/MS was used to measure endogenous 8-HOA, and western blotting was performed to evaluate thealtered key protein expressions upon the treatments.RESULTS: We demonstrated that D5D knockdown licenses DGLA to inhibit growth ofbreast cancer cells via promoting formation of 8-HOA that can inhibit histonedeacetylase and activate cell apoptotic proteins, such as procaspase 9 and PARP. Our strategy can also significantly inhibit cancer migration and invasion,associated with altered expression of MMP-2/- 9, E-cadherin, vimentin and snail. In addition, D5D knockdown and DGLA supplementation greatly enhanced the efficacyof 5-fluorouracil on breast cancer growth and migration.CONCLUSIONS: Consistent to our previous studies on colon and pancreatic cancer,here we demonstrate again that the high level of COX-2 in breast cancer cells canbe capitalized on inhibiting cancer growth and migration. The outcome of thistranslational research could guide us to develop new anti-cancer strategy and/or to improve current chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4250-8 PMCID: PMC5870477PMID: 29587668
