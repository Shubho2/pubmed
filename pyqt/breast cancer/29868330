Clinical Presentation  A 58-year-old malepresented with headaches, right-sided visual disturbances, and blurred and doublevision. The cause of double vision was partial weakness of the right III nerve,resulting from compression of the nerve by "hypertrophied" tumor-involved rightanterior clinoid. Medical history revealed two primary malignant tumors-malebreast cancer and prostate cancer (diagnosed 6 and 18 months prior,respectively). The patient was treated with chemotherapy and showed no signs ofactive disease, recurrence, or metastasis. Postcontrast head magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) showed extra-axial well-bordered enhancing mass measuring1.6 × 1.1 × 1 × 1 cm (anteroposterior, transverse, and craniocaudal dimensions)on the ACP, resembling a clinoidal meningioma. Extradural clinoidectomy withtumor resection was performed via right orbitozygomatic pretemporal skull baseapproach. Visual symptoms improved. Follow-up MRI showed no signs of tumorresidual or recurrence. Conclusion  This is the first case report of a metastasisof any kind on ACP. Metastasis should be included as a part of the differentialdiagnosis of lesions of the anterior clinoid. Extradural clinoidectomy is a safe and effective method in the treatment of these tumors.DOI: 10.1055/s-0038-1655773 PMCID: PMC5980493PMID: 29868330
