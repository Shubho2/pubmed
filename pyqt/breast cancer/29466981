Previous studies have reported that some lactic acidbacterial strains could inhibit colon cancer progression however; the exactmolecules involved have not yet been identified. So, in the current study, weillustrated the tumor suppressive effects of the newly identified Lactobacillusacidophilus DSMZ 20079 cell-free pentasaccharide against colon cancer cells. The chemical structure of the purified pentasaccharide was investigated by MALDI-TOF mass spectrum, 1D and 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The anticancerpotentiality of the purified pentasaccharide against both Human colon cancer(CaCo-2) and Human breast cancer (MCF7) cell lines with its safety usage pattern were evaluated using cytotoxicity, annexin V quantification and BrdUincorporation assays. Also, the immunomodulatory effects of the identifiedcompound were quantified on both LPS-induced PBMC cell model and cancer cellswith monitoring the immunophenotyping of T and dendritic cell surface marker. At molecular level, the alteration in gene expression of both inflammatory andapoptotic pathways were quantified upon pentasaccharide-cellular treatment byRTqPCR.RESULTS: The obtained data of the spectroscopic analysis, confirmed the structureof the newly extracted pentasaccharide; (LA-EPS-20079) to be: α-D-Glc(1→2)][α-L-Fuc(1→4)] α-D-GlcA(1→2) α-D-GlcA(1→2) α-D-GlcA. This pentasaccharide, recorded safe dose on normal mammalian cells ranged from 2 to 5 mg/ml with cancercells selectivity index, ranged of 1.96-51.3. Upon CaCo-2 cell treatment with thenon-toxic dose of LA-EPS-20079, the inhibition percentage in CaCo-2 cellularviability, reached 80.65 with an increase in the ratio of the apoptotic cells in sub-G0/G1 cell cycle phase. Also, this pentasaccharide showed potentialities toup-regulate the expression of IKbα, P53 and TGF genes.CONCLUSION: The anticancer potentialities of LA-EPS-20079 oligosaccharidesagainst human colon cancer represented through its regulatory effects on bothapoptotic and NF-κB inflammatory pathways.DOI: 10.1186/s12934-018-0877-z PMCID: PMC5820793PMID: 29466981
