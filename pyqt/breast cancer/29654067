For many rare cancers, no standard of careexists, and treatment is often extrapolated. Identifying potentially targetablegenomic alterations in rare tumors is a rational approach to improving treatment options. We sought to catalog these mutations in rare tumors and to assess their clinical utility.For this retrospective analysis, we selected rare tumor patientsfrom a dataset of patients who underwent clinical tumor genomic profiling.Sarcomas were excluded. To index potentially actionable alterations, patients'reports were reviewed for mutations in cancer-associated genes and pathways.Respective clinical records were abstracted to appraise the benefit of using atargeted therapy approach. Actionable alterations were defined as targeted by adrug available on-label, off-label, or in clinical trials.The 95 patientsanalyzed had 40 different tumor subtypes, most common being adenoid cystic (13%),cholangiocarcinoma (7%), and metaplastic breast (6%). At least one genomicalteration was identified in 87 patients (92%). The most common identifiablemutations were in TP53 (23%), KRAS (10%), PIK3CA (9%), CDKN2A/B (8%), BRAF (7%), MLL (7%), and ARID1A (6%). Thirty-six patients (38%) with 21 different tumors hadat least one potentially actionable alteration. Thirteen patients receivedtargeted therapy. Of these, 4 had a partial response, 6 had stable disease, and 3had progressive disease as the best response.The addition of genomic profiling tomanagement of rare cancers adds a potential line of therapy for cancers that havelittle or no standard of care. In our analysis, tumors with a BRAF alterationresponded well to BRAF inhibitors.
