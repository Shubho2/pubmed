Cells also recover to basal-likeconditions upon removal of epigenetic inhibitors rapidly. Inhibition of SUV4-20results in decreased H4{K20me2}; however, no effects on H4{K20me3} are observed, implying that another enzyme mediates H4K20me3. Most surprisingly, SUV4-20inhibition results in an increase in histone H4 acetylation attributable toproteoforms containing K20me2. This led us to hypothesize that hyperacetylatedproteoforms protect K20me2 from demethylation as an evolved compensatorymechanism. This concept is supported by subsequent results that pretreatment withan HDACi substantially diminishes the effects of SUV4-20 inhibition in pronecells and is further confirmed by HATi-facilitating SUV4-20 inhibition todecrease discrete H4{K20me2} in resistant cells.CONCLUSIONS: The chromatin response of cells to sudden perturbations issignificantly faster, nuanced and complex than previously described. Thepersistent nature of chromatin regulation may be achieved by a network of dynamicequilibria with compensatory mechanisms that operate at the proteoform level.DOI: 10.1186/s13072-018-0198-9 PMCID: PMC5992683PMID: 29880017
