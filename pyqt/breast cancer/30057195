Participating institutions and the Coordinating Center receivedInstitutional Review Board approval for a waiver of consent to collect and linkdata and perform analysis.RESULTS: A total of 194,437 (59.7%) screens were DBT versus 131,292 (40.3%) with DM. Women with dense breasts and higher calculated risk were more likely to bescreened with DBT. Recall rates were lower for DBT overall (8.83% DBT vs 10.98%DM, adjusted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval = 0.85, 0.83-0.87) and acrossall age groups, races, and breast densities, and at facilities that usedpredominantly DBT (8.05%) versus predominantly DM (11.22%), or a combination(10.73%). The most common diagnostic pathway after recall was mammography andultrasound. Women recalled from DBT were more likely to proceed directly toultrasound. The median time to biopsy (18 vs 22 days) and final diagnosis (10 vs 13 days) was shorter for DBT. The adjusted cancer rate, cancer detection rate,and specificity were higher for DBT.CONCLUSION: DBT demonstrated a more efficient screening pathway and improvedquality measures with lower recall rates in all patient types, reduced diagnosticmammography and shorter time to biopsy and final diagnosis.Copyright © 2018.
