To address the wide heterogeneity of the disease, the identification of novel antigen targets and the development of mAbs against them are needed. Ourlab previously generated a panel of mAbs against human embryonic stem cells(hESC) using a whole cell immunization approach in mice. These mAbs canpotentially target oncofetal antigens and be repurposed for antibody or antibody drug conjugate (ADC) therapy. From this panel, the novel IgG1 2448 was found tobind surface antigens on hESC and multiple cancer cell lines. Here, we show 2448 targets a unique glycan epitope on annexin A2 (ANXA2) and can potentially monitorthe Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in ovarian and breast cancer. Toevaluate 2448 as a potential drug, 2448 was engineered and expressed as achimeric IgG1. Chimeric 2448 (ch2448) demonstrated efficient and specific killingwhen conjugated to cytotoxic payloads as an ADC. In addition, ch2448 elicitedpotent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity in vitro andin vivo. Further engineering of ch2448 to remove fucose in the Fc domain enhancedADCC. Overall, these findings indicate that embryonic ANXA2 is an attractivetarget and suggest that ch2448 is a promising candidate for further therapeuticdevelopment.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24152 PMCID: PMC5862572PMID: 29568351
