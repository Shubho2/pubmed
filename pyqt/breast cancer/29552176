In the present study, a novel hER-α splice variant, ER-α30, wasidentified and cloned from clinical breast cancer tissue. The ER-α30 sequencelacked a ligand-binding domain and a ligand-dependent transcriptional activation domain but retained the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain, theDNA-binding domain and a partial hinge domain, and possesses a unique10-amino-acid domain. The expression of ER-α30 was associated withER-α66-negative and progesterone receptor-negative breast cancer. The 30 kDaprotein was expressed in stably transfected MDA-MB-231 cells, and theoverexpression of ER-α30 in MDA-MB-231 cells enhanced malignant biologicalbehaviors, including cellular proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. Theresults of the present study indicated that ER-α30 might represent a potentialbiomarker for breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7970 PMCID: PMC5840706PMID: 29552176
