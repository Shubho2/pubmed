Several studies have shown associationsbetween SES and many types of cancer such as lung cancer, breast cancer, andprostate cancer. For gliomas, no clear occupational or exposure risk factors havebeen identified, although some possible risk factors such as use of cellulartelephone are still controversial. The aim in the present study is to analyzewhether there is an association between SES and development of brain cancer. Datafrom 1999 through 2013 were collected from the Swedish Cancer Registry and fromthe National Statistics of Sweden. Age-standardized incidence rates for peoplewith different income were calculated using linear regression model. A total of11,892 patients were included, of which 5675 were meningiomas, 1216 low-gradegliomas, and 5001 high-grade gliomas. No clear trend between increasing incidencerates and higher income was seen in neither of the investigated brain tumorhistologies. In conclusion, the results should be interpreted with caution, butthere does not seem to be a correlation in this material between increased incomeand development of brain cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1108-5 PMCID: PMC5847626PMID: 29532282
