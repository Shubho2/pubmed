However, little is known about the molecular target(s)of CPX responsible for Cdc25A degradation. Here, we show that CPX induced thedegradation of Cdc25A neither by increasing CK1α or decreasing DUB3 expression,nor via activating GSK3β, but through activating Chk1 in rhabdomyosarcoma (Rh30) and breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231) cells. This is strongly supported by thefindings that inhibition of Chk1 with TCS2312 or knockdown of Chk1 profoundlyattenuated CPX-induced Cdc25A degradation in the cells. Furthermore, we observed that CPX caused DNA damage, which was independent of reactive oxygen species(ROS) induction, but related to iron chelation. CPX treatment resulted in theactivation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM-and RAD3-related (ATR) kinases. Treatment with Ku55933 (a selective ATM inhibitor) failed to preventCPX-induced Chk1 phosphorylation and Cdc25A degradation. In contrast, knockdownof ATR conferred high resistance to CPX-induced Chk1 phosphorylation and Cdc25Adegradation. Therefore, the results suggest that CPX-induced degradation ofCdc25A is attributed to the activation of ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway, aconsequence of iron chelation-induced DNA damage.DOI: 10.18632/genesandcancer.166 PMCID: PMC5931253PMID: 29725502
