Oncology (Williston Park). 2018 Jun;32(6):e52-e64.The Use of Surgery and Radiotherapy as Treatment of Regional Nodes in BreastCancer Patients.Mitchell MP, Sharma P.Ipsilateral regional nodal status is an important independent prognostic factorfor patients with breast cancer. Several decisions regarding local therapy arenecessary for patients found to have pathologically involved lymph node(s). This article reviews the role of completion dissection and/or radiation therapy inpatients found to have positive sentinel lymph node(s), taking into considerationuse of mastectomy vs lumpectomy, tumor characteristics, tumor biology, plans for systemic therapy, and patient preferences. Published literature and currentguidelines are reviewed, with emphasis on controversial topics such as regionalnodal and postmastectomy radiation therapy for patients with one to threepositive nodes. Choice of field design in patients undergoing radiation therapywill also be highlighted. Unique clinical situations such as locoregionaltreatment in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the emerging role oftumor biology and molecular assays in local therapy decision making will also be discussed.PMID: 29940065
