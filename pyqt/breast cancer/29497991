Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) representone of the most abundant cell types within the breast cancer stroma. Here, weaimed to explore the influence of CAFs on breast cancer gene expression, as well as on invasion and angiogenesis.METHODS: qRT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of several cancerprogression related genes (S100A4, TGFβ, FGF2, FGF7, PDGFA, PDGFB, VEGFA, IL-6,IL-8, uPA, MMP2, MMP9, MMP11 and TIMP1) in the human breast cancer-derived celllines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, before and after co-culture with CAFs. Stromalmononuclear inflammatory cell (MIC) MMP11 expression was used to stratify primarytumors. In addition, we assessed the in vitro effects of CAFs on both MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell invasion and endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation.RESULTS: We found that the expression levels of most of the genes tested weresignificantly increased in both breast cancer-derived cell lines after co-culturewith CAFs from either MMP11+ or MMP11- MIC tumors. IL-6 and IL-8 showed anincreased expression in both cancer-derived cell lines after co-culture with CAFsfrom MMP11+ MIC tumors. We also found that the invasive and angiogenic capacitiesof, respectively, MDA-MB-231 and HUVEC cells were increased after co-culture withCAFs, especially those from MMP11+ MIC tumors.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that tumor-derived CAFs can induce up-regulationof genes involved in breast cancer progression. Our data additionally indicatethat CAFs, especially those derived from MMP11+ MIC tumors, can promote breastcancer cell invasion and angiogenesis.DOI: 10.1007/s13402-018-0371-y PMID: 29497991
