Cas Lek Cesk. 2018 Spring;157(2):90-95.[Hereditary breast cancer: genetic etiology and current possibilities ofprevention and surgical treatment].[Article in Czech]Puchmajerová A, Tornikidis J, Mrňa L, Havlovicová M, Vlčková M, Chrudimská J,Macek M Jr, Hoch J.Cancer is the second most common cause of death in our population just aftercardiovascular diseases, since each third individual will become affected by itduring their lifetime. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. The lifetime cumulative risk of breast cancer in women under the age of 75 is around 8 % according to Czech statistics. In 70-75 % of all individuals sporadic breast carcinomas are found, with 5-10 % of all women suffer from the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. Radical, bilateral, removal of the mammarygland is the most effective prevention of breast cancer in BRCA positive women.We present a summary of 37 BRCA positive Czech patients who underwentprophylactic bilateral mastectomy and whose mean age was 46.5 years. Surgicalsolution is currently the only effective therapeutic way to prevent breast cancerin BRCA positive women with high genetic risk. The cosmetic consequences of this radical surgery can be solved through many reconstruction tasks.PMID: 29790359
