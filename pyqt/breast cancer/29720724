[Epub ahead of print]Fibroblast-derived CXCL12 promotes breast cancer metastasis by facilitating tumorcell intravasation.Ahirwar DK(1), Nasser MW(1), Ouseph MM(2), Elbaz M(1), Cuiti√±o MC(2), KladneyRD(2)(3), Varikuti S(1), Kaul K(1), Satoskar AR(1), Ramaswamy B(3)(4), ZhangX(5), Ostrowski MC(2)(3), Leone G(6)(7), Ganju RK(8)(9).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.(2)Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Ohio State University, Columbus,OH, 43210, USA.(3)Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.(4)Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210,USA.(5)Center for Biostatistics, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.(6)Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Ohio State University, Columbus,OH, 43210, USA. gustavo.leone@osumc.edu.(7)Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA. gustavo.leone@osumc.edu.(8)Department of Pathology, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.ramesh.ganju@osumc.edu.(9)Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA. ramesh.ganju@osumc.edu.The chemokine CXCL12 has been shown to regulate breast tumor growth, however, itsmechanism in initiating distant metastasis is not well understood. Here, wegenerated a novel conditional allele of Cxcl12 in mice and used afibroblast-specific Cre transgene along with various mammary tumor models toevaluate CXCL12 function in the breast cancer metastasis. Ablation of CXCL12 instromal fibroblasts of mice significantly delayed the time to tumor onset andinhibited distant metastasis in different mouse models. Elucidation of mechanismsusing in vitro and in vivo model systems revealed that CXCL12 enhances tumor cellintravasation by increasing vascular permeability and expansion of a leaky tumor vasculature. Furthermore, our studies revealed CXCL12 enhances permeability byrecruiting endothelial precursor cells and decreasing endothelial tight junction and adherence junction proteins. High expression of stromal CXCL12 in largecohort of breast cancer patients was directly correlated to blood vessel density and inversely correlated to recurrence and overall patient survival. In addition,our analysis revealed that stromal CXCL12 levels in combination with number ofCD31+ blood vessels confers poorer patient survival compared to individualprotein level. However, no correlation was observed between epithelial CXCL12 andpatient survival or blood vessel density. Our findings describe the novelinteractions between fibroblasts-derived CXCL12 and endothelial cells infacilitating tumor cell intrvasation, leading to distant metastasis. Overall, ourstudies indicate that cross-talk between fibroblast-derived CXCL12 andendothelial cells could be used as novel biomarker and strategy for developingtumor microenvironment based therapies against aggressive and metastatic breastcancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0263-7 PMID: 29720724
