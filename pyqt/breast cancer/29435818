Subject groups consisted of 187 patientsconsecutively referred during 1999-2015. A Cox proportional hazards model wasused to identify factors associated with prolonged survival from LM. The Coxprognostic index was created to identify the group of patients with the mostfavorable prognosis. Median survival for all patients and for those with LM asthe first site of metastases at presentation was 17 weeks and 1 year-survival was15 and 16%, respectively. Factors beneficially affecting survival were: KPS ≥ 70,older age, biological subtype ER/PR+HER2-, systemic treatment, intrathecaltreatment and radiation therapy. Based on these factors, 4 prognostic groups werefound, with the most favorable group being 24 LM patients with median survival of9.6 months. In this group, all patients were treated systemically and all wereirradiated, 88% had KPS ≥ 70, about 80% had luminal breast cancer, 75% weretreated intrathecally and 58% were more than 53 years old. Out of 4 prognosticgroups of patients with LM, the most favorable group was selected. The mediansurvival of breast cancer patients with the leptomeninges as the only site ofmetastases was comparable to those who had metastases in the leptomeninges and inother organs.DOI: 10.1007/s11060-018-2790-z PMID: 29435818
