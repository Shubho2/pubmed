We compared messenger RNA (mRNA) profiles of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) in patientswith metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to estimate their utility in therapymanagement.METHODS: Blood was collected from 35 hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negativepatients with MBC at the time of disease progression and at 2 consecutive stagingtime points. CTCs were isolated from 5 mL of blood by positive immunomagneticselection, and EVs from 4 mL of plasma by a membrane affinity-based procedure.mRNA was reverse transcribed, preamplified, and analyzed for 18 genes bymultimarker quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. RNA profileswere normalized to healthy donor controls (n = 20), and results were correlatedwith therapy outcome.RESULTS: There were great differences in mRNA profiles of EVs and CTCs, with only5% (21/403) of positive signals identical in both fractions. Transcripts involvedin the PI3K signaling pathway were frequently overexpressed in CTCs, and AURKA,PARP1, and SRC signals appeared more often in EVs. Of all patients, 40% and 34%showed ERBB2 and ERBB3 signals, respectively, in CTCs, which was significantlyassociated with disease progression (P = 0.007). Whereas MTOR signals in CTCssignificantly correlated with response (P = 0.046), signals in EVs indicatedtherapy failure (P = 0.011). The presence of AURKA signals in EVs seemed to be a marker for the indication of unsuccessful treatment of bone metastasis.CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the potential of CTCs and EVs for therapymonitoring and the need for critical evaluation of the implementation of anyliquid biopsy in clinical practice.Â© 2018 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.DOI: 10.1373/clinchem.2017.283531 PMID: 29769179
