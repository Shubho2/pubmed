To address this issue, a cell-penetrating peptide-assisted liposomalsystem was developed for codelivery of doxorubicin and andrographolide. Thisnanomedicine-based combination therapy showed the ability to inhibit the in vitromigration and invasion of 4T1 cells through the wound healing and transwellinvasion assays. Furthermore, this delivery system exhibited the enhancedaccumulation in the tumor tissues and deep intratumoral penetration. Thesynergistic effect of doxorubicin and andrographolide led to an evidentinhibition of tumor growth in an orthotopic breast tumor mouse model andefficient prevention of lung metastasis. The therapeutic mechanism was associatedwith the anti-angiogenesis effect. In conclusion, this nanomedicine-basedcombination therapy provides a potential method for overcoming metastatic breast cancers.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01164 PMID: 29498868
