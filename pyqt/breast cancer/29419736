Marine sponges have historicallybeen a source of compounds with anticancer activity. In this study, we screenedextracts from twenty marine sponges collected off the coast of Western Australia for cytotoxic activity against TNBC cells. One very active extract derived fromthe sponge Monanchora viridis was selected for bioactivity-guided fractionation. Through multiple steps of purification, we isolated a potent cytotoxic compound, which was identified as crambescidin 800 (C800). We found that C800 exhibitedcytotoxic potency in a panel of breast cancer cells, of which TNBC and luminalcancer cell models were the most sensitive. In addition, C800 induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, resulting in a decline in the expression of cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6 in TNBC cells. This effect was associated with the inhibition ofphosphorylation of Akt, NF-ÎºB, and MAPK pathways, resulting in apoptosis in TNBC cells.DOI: 10.3390/md16020053 PMCID: PMC5852481PMID: 29419736
