Gradishar, MD, Feinberg School ofMedicine at Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.The emergence of CDK4/6 inhibitors has changed the treatment algorithm foradvanced/metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. In pivotal trialsof palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, doubling in progression-freesurvival has been seen. All 3 agents in this class are now included in the NCCNGuidelines for Breast Cancer, and clinicians should be incorporating these agentsinto their treatment algorithms. The other important issue in this breast cancer setting is extended duration of endocrine therapy. Most of the benefit is modest and toxicity is an issue; therefore, extended-duration endocrine therapy shouldbe highly individualized. For triple-negative disease, platinum agents and PARPinhibitors are helping some patients, but immunotherapies and other novel classesof drugs now in development hold the promise of even better outcomes. InHER2-positive early-stage disease, dual HER2 blockade is of modest benefit, andextended treatment with neratinib may be a good option for some high-riskpatients.Copyright Â© 2018 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.DOI: 10.6004/jnccn.2018.0043 PMID: 29784737
