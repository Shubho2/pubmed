China.Triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive breast cancer subtypethat lacks effective targeted therapies. In the present study, we revealed thatthe expression of miR‑30a was significantly decreased in TNBC, and TNBC patients with low expression of miR‑30a were associated with high histological grade andmore lymph node metastasis. Moreover, we found that miR‑30a suppressed TNBC cell epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), as demonstrated by the overexpression ofmiR‑30a which increased the expression of epithelial marker E‑cadherin butdecreased the expression of mesenchymal markers N‑cadherin and vimentin.Furthermore, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR‑30a significantlysuppressed TNBC cell invasion and migration, as well as inhibited tumor growthand metastasis in vivo. More importantly, RTK‑like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) waspredicted as the direct target of miR‑30a, which was subsequently confirmed byluciferase assays. Forced expression of miR‑30a in TNBC cells decreased ROR1expression, whereas the overexpression of ROR1 reversed the suppressive effectsof miR‑30a in TNBC cell migration and invasion. Collectively, this studyindicated that miR‑30a functions as a tumor‑metastasis suppressor miRNA in TNBCby directly targeting ROR1 and that miR‑30a may serve as a novel therapeutictarget for TNBC.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6379 PMCID: PMC5983935PMID: 29693179
