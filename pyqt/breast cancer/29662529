Symptoms are nonspecific, so the majority of patientspresent with advanced disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a therapeutic optionthat has not been well studied. The global literature includes only isolatedreports on this subject. This is why we are presenting the following case: a60-year-old female patient with a locally advanced, inoperable duodenal ADCreceived neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Having presented a favourable response asobserved in the post-neoadjuvant extension studies, a pancreaticoduodenectomy wasperformed without any perioperative complications and with satisfactory progress.The final biopsy reported a complete pathological response. After being monitoredfor 34 months, the patient was free from locoregional and distant metastaticdisease. During the last weeks of monitoring, she developed a second primarybreast tumour, which has been corroborated by immunohistochemistry.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.816 PMCID: PMC5880224PMID: 29662529
