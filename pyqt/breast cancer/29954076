Several studiesindicate that GPCRs control many aspects of cancer progression including tumorgrowth, invasion, migration, survival and metastasis. While it is known that GPCRactivity can be altered in cancer through aberrant overexpression,gain-of-function activating mutations, and increased production and secretion of agonists, the precise mechanisms of how GPCRs contribute to cancer progressionremains elusive. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a unique class of GPCRs implicated in cancer. PARs are a subfamily of GPCRs comprised of four membersthat are irreversibly activated by proteolytic cleavage induced by variousproteases generated in the tumor microenvironment. Given the unusual proteolytic irreversible activation of PARs, expression of receptors at the cell surface is akey feature that influences signaling responses and is exquisitely controlled by endocytic adaptor proteins. Here, we discuss new survey data from the CancerGenome Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression projects analysis of expressionof all PAR family member expression in human tumor samples as well as the roleand function of the endocytic sorting machinery that controls PAR expression and signaling of PARs in normal cells and in cancer.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19071886 PMID: 29954076
