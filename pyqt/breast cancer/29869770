Breast specimens weregrouped into molecular phenotypes and classified as responders or non-responders after completion of NC. Patients underwent standard follow-up to obtain thedisease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). After breast tumorsegmentation, three-dimensional (3D) textural measures were computed based onrun-length matrices (RLM) and co-occurrence matrices (CM). Relations betweentextural features with risk categories attending to molecular phenotypes wereexplored. Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis were used to study the potential of textural variables, molecularphenotypes and histologic response to predict DFS and OS. Receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) analysis was used to obtain the best cut-off value, the areaunder the curve (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity considering OS and DFS.RESULTS: Eighteen patients were classified as responders. Mean ± SD of DFS and OSwas 70.87 ± 21.85 and 76.77 ± 18.80 months, respectively. Long run emphasis (LRE)and long run high gray-level emphasis (LRHGE) showed a relation with riskcategories. Low gray-level run emphasis (LGRE), LRHGE and run-lengthnon-uniformity (RLNU) showed association with the NC response. Textural variableswere significantly associated with OS and DFS in univariate analysis. Regardingthe multivariate Cox regression analysis, PET stage with short run highgray-level emphasis (SRHGE) was significantly associated with OS, and PET stageand high gray-level run emphasis (HGRE) with DFS.CONCLUSION: Textural variables obtained with 18F-FDG PET/CT were predictors ofneoadjuvant chemotherapy response and prognosis, being as relevant as PET stageat diagnosis for OS and DFS prediction.DOI: 10.1007/s12149-018-1253-0 PMID: 29869770
