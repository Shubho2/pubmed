In order to define the cellularmachinery leading to this change in growth behavior of FTC-133 human thyroidcancer cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we recently performed proteomeanalyses on these cell lines and determined the proteins' accumulation inmonolayer cells grown under 1g-conditions as well as in the cells of spheroidsassembled under simulated microgravity during three and 14 days, respectively. Atthat time, an influence of the increment or decrement of some of the more than5000 proteins detected in each cell line was investigated. In this study, wefocused on posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins. For this purpose, we selected candidates from the list of the proteins detected in the twopreceding proteome analyses, which showed significant accumulation in spheroidcells as compared to 1g monolayer cells. Then we searched for those PTMs of theselected proteins, which according to the literature have already been determinedexperimentally. Using the Semantic Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL),various databases were examined. Most efficient was the search in the latestversion of the dbPTM database. In total, we found 72 different classes of PTMscomprising mainly phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination and acetylation.Most interestingly, in 35 of the 69 proteins, N6 residues of lysine aremodifiable.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19082257 PMID: 30071661
