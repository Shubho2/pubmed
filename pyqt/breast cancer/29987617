Maximum activity concentrations (Bq/ml) of volume of interests overtumors and plasma in descending aorta were obtained over time frames. Kineticparameters were estimated using in-house developed software with the two-tissuethree-compartment irreversible model (2TCM) (K1, k2, k3, and Ki; k4 = 0) andPatlak model (Ki) based on different acquisition durations (Td) (10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 25, and 30 min, separately). Different linear regression onset time (T0)points (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min) were applied in Patlak analysis. Ki of the 30-min data set was taken as the gold standard for comparison. Pearson product-momentcorrelation coefficient (R) of 0.9 was chosen as a limit for the correlation.RESULTS: The correlation of kinetic parameters between the gold standard and the abbreviated dynamic data series increased with longer Td from 10 to 30 min. k2and k3 using 2TCM and Ki using Patlak model revealed poor correlations fordynamic PET with Td ≤ 14 min (k2: R = 0.84, 0.85, 0.86; k3: R = 0.67, 0.67, 0.67;Ki: R = 0.72, 0.78, 0.87 at Td = 10, 12, and 14 min, respectively). Excellentcorrelations were shown for all kinetic parameters when Td ≥ 16 min regardless ofthe kinetic model and T0 value (R > 0.9).CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that a 16-min dynamic PET acquisition appearsto be sufficient to provide accurate [18F]FLT kinetics to quantitatively assessthe proliferation in breast cancer lesions.DOI: 10.1007/s11307-018-1231-x PMID: 29987617
