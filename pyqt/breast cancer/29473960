At 3, 12, and 36 months,128 patients with T1-T2 breast cancer completed a questionnaire onbreast-specific factors and overall cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction,using a 4-point Likert scale.RESULTS: There was a strong positive correlation between breast-specific factors,overall cosmetic outcome,and satisfaction at all time-points. Excellent/goodcosmetic outcomes and satisfaction decreased during follow-up. A shift was noted in the degree of influence of the various breast-specific factors. At 3 years,symmetry factors such as size, shape, and nipple position largely determined apatient's opinion on the final cosmesis, followed by firmness. The risk of anunacceptable outcome was associated with young age and large excision volumes.CONCLUSION: A questionnaire including breast-specific questions providesimportant information on final cosmetic results and satisfaction after BCT. Theseoutcomes can also be of great value as quality indicators and pre-operativecounseling. The major influence of breast-specific factors on asymmetryunderlines the importance of achieving an optimal excision volume at the initial procedure.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jso.25012 PMID: 29473960  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
