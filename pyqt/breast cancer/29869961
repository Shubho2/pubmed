Consenting women were randomly assigned 1:1 to undergo DBT+DM or DM (both of which involved two projections and double reading). Women were treatedaccording to the decision at DBT+DM. Sensitivity, recall rate, and positivepredictive value (PPV) at baseline were determined; the ratios of these rates forDBT+DM relative to DM alone were determined. Results From March 2014 to March2016, 9777 women were recruited to the DM+DBT arm of the study, and 9783 womenwere recruited to the DM arm (mean age, 56.2 vs 56.3 years). Recall was 3.5% inboth arms; detection was 4.5 per 1000 (44 of 9783) and 8.6 per 1000 (83 of 9777),respectively (+89%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 31, 72). PPV of the recall was 13.0% and 24.1%, respectively (P = .0002); 72 of 80 cancers found in the DBT+DMarm and with complete DBT imaging were positive at least at one DBT-alonereading. The greater detection rate for DM+DBT was stronger for ductal carcinoma in situ (+180%, 95% CI: 1, 665); it was notable for small and medium invasivecancers, but not for large ones (+94 [95% CI: 6, 254]; +122 [95% CI: 18, 316];-12 [95% CI: -68, 141]; for invasive cancers < 10 mm, 10-19 mm, and ≥ 20 mm,respectively). Conclusion DBT+DM depicts 90% more cancers in a populationpreviously screened with DM, with similar recall rates.© RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018172119 PMID: 29869961
