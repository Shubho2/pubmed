Arterial stiffness is an independent risk factor forfuture cardiovascular diseases and can be used as a predictive marker ofsubclinical cardiac damage. The aim of this study is to analyze the arterialstiffness in breast cancer patients who are in the follow-up period afterreceiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens with trastuzumab.Methods and Material: We enrolled 45 HER2-positive breast cancer patients who areon follow-up at least for six months after completion of adjuvant chemotherapywith trastuzumab, and cardiovascular risk matched 30 control volunteers. Themeasurements were done with pulse wave analyzing machine.Results: Mean pulse wave velocity was higher in breast cancer patients comparedto controls. The pulse wave velocity was significantly higher in patientsreceiving aromatase inhibitors compared to patients under tamoxifen. It was also significantly higher in postmenopausal breast cancer patients than postmenopausalcontrols.Conclusions: Arterial stiffness measurements may predict the breast cancersurvivors with higher risk for cardiovascular events earlier in the follow-upperiod, and necessary preventive approaches and/or treatments can be applied.DOI: 10.1155/2018/5352914 PMCID: PMC5954934PMID: 29854434
