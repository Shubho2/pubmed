These estimations arenot accurate. This has led to uncertainties while assessing the radiation riskfactors at low doses. Although there are reports on the radiation inducedadaptive response, the mechanism of action is not fully elucidated, leading tothe uncertainties. One of the outcomes of low dose radiation exposure is believedto be an adaptive response. The mechanism of adaptive response is not fullyunderstood. Therefore, the study was undertaken to understand the role of hypoxiainducible factor (HIF) on radiation induced adaptive response.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 cells pre-exposed tolow dose γ-radiation (0.1 Gy; priming dose) were exposed to 2 Gy (challengingdose) 8 h after the priming dose and studied for the adaptive response. Celldeath was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay and apoptosis was measured by fluorescence-activated cellsorting analysis. DNA damage was measured by alkaline comet assay. HIFtranscription activity was assayed using transiently transfected plasmid havingHIF consensus sequence and luciferase as the reporter gene.RESULTS: Cells when exposed to 0.1 Gy priming dose 8 h prior to the higher dose(2 Gy; challenging dose) results in lower amount of radiation induced damagescompared to the cells exposed to 2 Gy alone. Cobalt chloride treatment in placeof priming dose also results in the protection to cells when exposed tochallenging dose. There was up-regulation of HIF activity when cells were exposedto priming dose, indicating the role of HIF in radiation induced response.CONCLUSION: Results indicate the γ-radiation induced adaptive response. One ofthe mechanism proposed is up-regulation of HIF after low dose exposure, whichprotects the cells from damages when they are exposed to challenging dose of 2 Gyradiation.DOI: 10.1080/09553002.2018.1493241 PMID: 29944059
