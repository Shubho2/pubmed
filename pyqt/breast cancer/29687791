Adedicated workflow with the capability to simultaneously characterize andquantify intact glycopeptides in a site-specific and high-throughput manner isessential to reveal specific glycosylation alteration patterns in complexbiological systems. In this study, an enhanced, dedicated, large-scalesite-specific quantitative N-glycoproteomics workflow has been established, whichincludes improved specific extraction of membrane-bound glycoproteins using thefilter aided sample preparation (FASP) method, enhanced enrichment ofN-glycopeptides using sequential hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography(HILIC) and multi-lectin affinity (MLA) enrichment, site-specific N-glycopeptide characterization enabled by EThcD, relative quantitation utilizing isobaricN,N-dimethyl leucine (DiLeu) tags and automated FDR-based large-scale dataanalysis by Byonic. For the first time, our study shows that HILIC complements toa very large extent to MLA enrichment with only 20% overlapping in enrichingintact N-glycopeptides. When applying the developed workflow to site-specificN-glycoproteome study in PANC1 cells, we were able to identify 1067 intactN-glycopeptides, representing 311 glycosylation sites and 88 glycan compositions from 205 glycoproteins. We further applied this approach to study theglycosylation alterations in PKM2 knockout cells vs. parental breast cancer cellsand revealed altered N-glycoprotein/N-glycopeptide patterns and very differentglycosylation microheterogeneity for different types of glycans. To obtain a morecomprehensive map of glycoprotein alterations, N-glycopeptides after treatmentwith PNGase F were also analyzed. A total of 484 deglycosylated peptides werequantified, among which 81 deglycosylated peptides from 70 glycoproteins showedsignificant changes. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the PI3K/Akt signalingpathway was highly enriched, which provided evidence to support the previousfinding that PKM2 knockdown cancer cells rely on activation of Akt for theirsurvival. With glycosylation being one of the most important signalingmodulators, our results provide additional evidence that signaling pathways areclosely regulated by metabolism.DOI: 10.1039/c8an00216a PMCID: PMC5975206 [Available on 2019-05-29]PMID: 29687791
