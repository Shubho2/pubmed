However, the efficacy of this combinationfor the treatment of gastric cancer, and potential predictive therapeuticbiomarkers remain unclear. Recent evidence suggests that the deficiency ofAT-rich interactive domain containing protein 1A (ARID1A), which is a crucialchromatin remodeling gene, sensitizes tumor cells to PI3K and PARP inhibitors.Herein, we evaluated the therapeutic role of the combined treatment of PI3Kinhibitor BKM120 and PARP inhibitor olaparib on gastric cancer cells, andexplored ARID1A as a predictive biomarker. The results demonstrated that combinedtreatment with PI3K and PARP inhibitors effectively inhibited proliferationdetected by MTS and clonogenic assay, invasion and migration by Transwell assay, of gastric cancer cells with ARID1A deficiency. Mechanistically, dual blockade ofPI3K and PARP in ARID1A-depleted gastric cancer cells significantly increasedapoptosis detected by flow cytometry, and induced DNA damage by immunofluorescentstaining. Taken together, these data suggest that the combined treatment withPI3K inhibitor BKM120 and PARP inhibitor olaparib may be a promising therapeutic regimen for the treatment of gastric cancer, and ARID1A deficiency could serve asa potential predictive therapeutic biomarker.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6445 PMID: 29767248
