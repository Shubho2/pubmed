Weinvestigate the predictive ability of Prosigna regarding the effectiveness ofcyclophosphamide-based adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal patients withhigh-risk breast cancer.METHODS: Prosigna assays were performed on the NanoString platform in tumors fromparticipants in Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) 77B, a four-arm trial thatrandomized premenopausal women with high-risk early breast cancer to no systemic treatment, levamisole, oral cyclophosphamide (C) or cyclophosphamide,methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF).RESULTS: In total, this retrospective analysis included 460 women (40% of the1146 randomized patients). The continuous Prosigna ROR score was prognostic inthe no systemic treatment group (unadjusted P < 0.001 for disease-free survival(DFS), P = 0.001 for overall survival (OS)). No statistically significantinteraction of continuous ROR score and treatment on DFS and OS was found. Ahighly significant association was observed between intrinsic subtypes and C/CMF treatment for DFS (Pinteraction = 0.003 unadjusted, P = 0.001 adjusted) and OS(Pinteraction = 0.04). In the adjusted analysis treatment with C/CMF wasassociated with a reduced risk of DFS events in patients with basal-like (hazard ratio (HR) 0.14; 95% CI 0.06; 0.32) and luminal B (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.27; 0.84)subtypes but not in patients with Human epidermal growth factor receptor-enriched(HR 1.05; 95% CI 0.56; 1.95) or luminal A (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.32; 1.16) subtypes.CONCLUSION: The Prosigna ROR score and intrinsic subtypes were prognostic inhigh-risk premenopausal patients with breast cancer, and intrinsic subtypesidentify high-risk patients with or without major benefit from adjuvant C/CMFtreatment.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1012-0 PMCID: PMC6062869PMID: 30053900
