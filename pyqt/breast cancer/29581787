China.Sulfotransferase family 1E member 1 (SULT1E1) is known to catalyzesulfoconjugation and play a crucial role in the deactivation of estrogenhomeostasis, which is involved in tumorigenesis and the progression of breast andendometrial cancers. Our previous study has shown that the protein levels ofSULT1E1 were decreased in breast cancer; however, the underlying mechanism isstill poorly understood. In this study, we explored the functional and molecular mechanisms by which SULT1E1 influenced breast cancer. Here, we identified thatoverexpression of SULT1E1 inhibited breast cancer cell growth through inducingapoptosis and arresting cell cycle progression. Furthermore, enforced expression of SULT1E1 suppressed tumor cell migration and invasion. Moreover, we found that the activation of PPARγ was required for SULT1E1-mediated downregulation ofC-myc, Cyclin D1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 as well as for cell apoptosis, migration andinvasion. In addition, the overexpression of SULT1E1 significantly inhibitedtumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our findings indicated that SULT1E1performed its tumor suppressor characteristics by activating PPARγ, whichprovided a novel target for patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.7150/jca.23596 PMCID: PMC5868175PMID: 29581787
