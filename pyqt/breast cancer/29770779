The expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR)and Ki67 among 525 neoadjuvant chemotherapy cases was studied byimmunohistochemistry (IHC). Differences between specimens made throughpreoperative core needle biopsy (CB) and excised tissue biopsy (EB) wereobserved. The positive rates of ER, PR and Ki67 in CB and EB were 65.3 and 63.2%,51.0% and 42.6%, 65.6% and 43.4% respectively. The expression of ER, PR and Ki67 in CB and EB had no statistically significant difference. However, afterneoadjuvant chemotherapy, the discordance rates of ER, PR and Ki67 were 15.2%(79/521), 26.9% (140/520), and 44.8% (225/502), respectively. The ER, PR, andKi67 status changed from positive to negative in 7.5% (39/521), 13.3% (69/520),and 21.1% (106/502) of the patients, whereas ER, PR and Ki67 status changed from negative to positive in 7.7% (40/521), 13.6% (71/520), and 23.7% (119/502) of thepatients, respectively. These results showed that the status of some biomarkerschanges after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and biomarker status needs to bereexamined to optimize adjuvant systemic therapy and better prognosis assessment.DOI: 10.7555/JBR.32.20170059 PMID: 29770779
