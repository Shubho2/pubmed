CUB-domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1), a transmembrane adaptorprotein, is highly maintained and required in the context of cellular metastatic potential in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). For this reason, geneexpression levels of CDCP1 have been considered as a prognostic marker in TNBC.However, not rarely, transcript levels of genes do not reflect always the levels of proteins, due to the post-transcriptional regulation. Here we show thatmiR-17/20a control the FBXL14 E3 ligase, establishing FBXL14 as an upstreamregulator of the CDCP1 pathway. FBXL14 acts as an novel interaction partner ofCDCP1, and facilitates its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation with anenhanced capacity to suppress CDCP1 protein stability that eventually preventsCDCP1 target genes involved in breast cancer metastasis. Our findings first time uncovers the regulatory mechanism of CDCP-1 protein stabilization, morepredictable criteria than gene expression levels for prognosis of breast cancerpatients.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0372-3 PMID: 29973690
