In thisstudy, breast cancer tissues from different patients were imaged by ahyperspectral system to detect spectral differences between normal and breastcancer tissues. Tissue samples mounted on slides were identified from 10different patients. Samples from each patient included both normal and ductalcarcinoma tissue, both stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain and unstained.Slides were imaged using a snapshot HSI system, and the spectral reflectancedifferences were evaluated. Analysis of the spectral reflectance values indicatedthat wavelengths near 550â€‰nm showed the best differentiation between tissuetypes. This information was used to train image processing algorithms usingsupervised and unsupervised data. The K-means method was applied to thehyperspectral data cubes, and successfully detected spectral tissue differenceswith sensitivity of 85.45%, and specificity of 94.64% with true negative rate of 95.8%, and false positive rate of 4.2%. These results were verified byground-truth marking of the tissue samples by a pathologist. In the hyperspectralimage analysis, the image processing algorithm, K-means, shows the greatestpotential for building a semi-automated system that could identify and sortbetween normal and ductal carcinoma in situ tissues.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00017 PMCID: PMC5808285PMID: 29468139
