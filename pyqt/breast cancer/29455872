Monoclonal antibodies directed against theprogrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) provides durabledisease control, particularly in melanoma, lung, kidney, bladder and head andneck cancers. The purpose of this review is to synthesize current data on theexpression of PD-L1 in breast cancer and on the preliminary clinical results ofPD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in breast cancer patients. In breast cancer,PD-L1 expression is heterogeneous and is generally associated with the presenceof tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as well as the presence of poor-prognosisfactors, such as young age, high grade, ER-negativity, PR-negativity, and HER-2overexpression, high proliferative index, and aggressive molecular subtypes(triple negative, basal-like, HER-2-overexpressing). Its prognostic value remainscontroversial when assessed with immunohistochemistry, whereas it seems favorablein triple-negative cancers when assessed at the mRNA level. Early clinical trialswith PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in breast cancer have shown efficacy in terms of tumorresponse and/or disease control in refractory metastatic breast cancers, notably in the triple-negative subtype. Many trials are currently underway, both in themetastatic and neo-adjuvant setting. A crucial issue is identification ofbiomarkers predictive of response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.Copyright © 2018 Société Française du Cancer.
