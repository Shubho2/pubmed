Based on emergingevidence of enhanced detection, the program transitioned to digital breasttomosynthesis (DBT) screening.METHODS: This is a prospective pilot evaluation of DBT with synthesised 2Dmammography screening implemented during April 2015-March 2017; the rate andcharacteristics of cancers detected at DBT screening were compared with thosedetected at the preceding digital mammography (DM) screening round (April2013-March 2015) in the same screening program. Distribution of imaging andtumour characteristics were compared.RESULTS: Amongst 34,071 women screened in the Verona DBT pilot, 315 BCs weredetected; 153 BCs were detected amongst 29,360 women in the DM screening round.Estimated CDRs were 9.2/1000 (95% CI 8.3-10.3) DBT screens versus 5.2/1000 (95%CI 4.4-6.1) DM screens, P < 0.001. Statistically significant differences werefound in the distribution of whether recall by one/both screen readers (more BCs recalled by both readers at DBT than DM); whether detected on one/two views(higher proportion detected on only one view at DBT than DM); type ofradiological lesions; tumour stage, pT and histological categories (lowerproportion of DCIS/pTis, higher proportions of pT1a and pT1b, and higherproportion of invasive cancers of special types, at DBT than DM); and tumourgrade (higher proportion of grade I at DBT than DM). There were no differences indistributions of nodal and hormone receptor (ER/PR) status.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide early insights into the extent thattransitioning to DBT screening may modify the characteristics of screen-detected breast cancer to inform discussion regarding pros and cons of DBT screening;although our data provide some reassurance that DBT does not increase theproportion of screen-detected DCIS, they highlight mixed findings on comparative tumour characteristics, suggesting a potential for enhancing screening benefitand possibly also over-diagnosis from DBT screening.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4756-4 PMID: 29557996
