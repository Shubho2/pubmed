The current study elucidated the means by which RES enhances theanti‑proliferative effects of cisplatin (CIS) on MCF‑7 cells, focusing on theinhibitory effects on DNA repair of double‑strand breaks (DSBs). ChemoresistantMCF‑7 cells (MCF‑7R) were generated by continuous exposure to low concentrations of CIS (10 µM CIS‑IC40) during 5 passages, with the IC50 value increasing~3‑fold. Using an MTT assay, we estimated the changes in IC50 for CIS in MCF‑7,T47‑D, MDA‑MB‑231 and MCF‑7R cells in the presence of RES. The relativetranscript level of Nbs‑1, Mre‑11 and Rad‑50 genes was assessed using RT‑qPCRanalysis. Rad51 and H2AX [pSer139] protein expression was determined by westernblot analysis. RES at 50 and 100 µM significantly enhanced the anti‑proliferativeeffects of CIS in both MCF‑7 and MCF‑7R cells, decreasing the IC50 values for CISto one‑tenth and one‑sixth, respectively. A total of 100 µM RES decreased therelative transcript levels of homologous recombination (HR) initiation complexcomponents and the Rad51 protein level in MCF‑7 and MCF‑7R cells. After 48 h ofCIS DNA damage, the levels of Rad51 protein increased, but this effect wasinhibited by 100 µM RES. RES also maintained serine 139 phosphorylation ofhistone H2AX, suggesting that RES prevents the repair of DSBs. It was observedthat RES exerts an antagonistic effect over CIS on the activation of Rad51 andsustained phosphorylation of H2AX. The results suggest that RES in combinationwith DNA damage‑based therapy has potential as a strategy to overcome resistance and provide much safer and more effective treatment for breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6336 PMID: 29620223
