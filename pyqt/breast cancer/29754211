Two gustatory tests wereconducted: an instillation method examining the threshold for four basic tastestimuli and an electrogustometry method measuring the threshold for perceptionwith electric stimulation at the front two-thirds of the tongue (cranial nerveVII) and at the back third of the tongue (cranial nerve IX). The results of thetwo gustatory tests and clinicopathological factors were compared between thechemotherapy and control groups and between patients with and without awarenessof dysgeusia in the chemotherapy group.RESULTS: In the chemotherapy group, 19 (44%) patients were aware of dysgeusia and8 (19%) had hypogeusia using the instillation method. Although more patients had parageusia in the chemotherapy than control group, no significant differences in the results of the two gustatory tests were observed. Patients with dysgeusiaawareness had a higher threshold at cranial nerve IX using the electrogustometry method than those without dysgeusia awareness; no significant differences inhypogeusia were observed using the instillation method. In fact, 74% (14/19) ofpatients with dysgeusia awareness could identify the four tastes accurately usingthe instillation method. Similar results were observed for the instillation andelectrogustometry methods at cranial nerve VII.CONCLUSIONS: While approximately half of the chemotherapy patients were aware of dysgeusia, 81% (35/43) of them could accurately identify the four basic tastesusing the instillation method.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4256-4 PMID: 29754211
