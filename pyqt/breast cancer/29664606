Theranostic gastrin-releasingpeptide receptor (GRPR)-directed radiopeptides have been proposed for themanagement of GRPR-expressing prostate and breast cancers. We have recentlyintroduced the PET tracer 68Ga-SB3 (SB3, DOTA- p-aminomethylaniline-diglycolicacid-DPhe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-NHEt), a receptor-radioantagonist thatenables the visualization of GRPR-positive lesions in humans. Aiming to fullyassess the theranostic potential of SB3, we herein report on the impact ofswitching 68Ga to 111In/177Lu-label on the biological properties of resultingradiopeptides. Notably, the bioavailability of 111In/177Lu-SB3 in micedrastically deteriorated compared with metabolically robust 68Ga-SB3, and as aresult led to poorer 111In/177Lu-SB3 uptake in GRPR-positive PC-3 xenografts. Thepeptide cleavage sites were identified by chromatographic comparison of bloodsamples from mice intravenously receiving 111In/177Lu-SB3 with each of newlysynthesized 111In/177Lu-SB3-fragments. Coinjection of the radioconjugates withthe neprilysin (NEP)-inhibitor phosphoramidon led to full stabilization of111In/177Lu-SB3 in peripheral mouse blood and resulted in markedly enhancedradiolabel uptake in the PC-3 tumors. In conclusion, in situ NEP-inhibition ledto indistinguishable 68Ga/111In/177Lu-SB3 profiles in mice emphasizing thetheranostic prospects of SB3 for clinical use.DOI: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00225 PMID: 29664606
