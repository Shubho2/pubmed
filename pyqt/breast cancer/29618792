In this study, weestablish a suitable model to study breast cancer-induced cardiomyopathy in mice.We used Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma cells to induce subcutaneous tumor in 129/SvJmice and studied its effect on heart function. In Ehrlich Ascites Carcinomabearing mice, we found significant reduction in left ventricle wall thickness,ejection fraction, and fractional shortening increase in left ventricle internal diameter. We found higher muscle atrophy, degeneration, fibrosis, expression ofcell-adhesion molecules and cell death in tumor-bearing mice hearts. As observed in cancer patients, we found that mTOR, a key signalling molecule responsible formaintaining cell growth and autophagy was suppressed in this model. Tumor bearingmice hearts show increased expression and nuclear localization of TFEB and FoxO3atranscription factors, which are involved in the upregulation of muscle atrophygenes, lysosomal biogenesis genes and autophagy genes. We propose that EhrlichAscites Carcinoma induced tumor can be used as a model to identify potentialtherapeutic targets for the treatment of heart failure in patients suffering fromcancer-induced cardiomyopathy. This model can also be used to test the adverseconsequences of cancer chemotherapy in heart.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-23669-9 PMCID: PMC5884778PMID: 29618792
