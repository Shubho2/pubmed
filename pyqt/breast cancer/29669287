Electronic address: lma4@mdanderson.org.Although EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors have shown antitumor effects in EZH2-mutatedlymphoma and ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer, many cancers do not respond becauseEZH2 can promote cancer independently of its histone methyltransferase activity. Here we identify ZRANB1 as the EZH2 deubiquitinase. ZRANB1 binds,deubiquitinates, and stabilizes EZH2. Depletion of ZRANB1 in breast cancer cells results in EZH2 destabilization and growth inhibition. Systemic delivery ofZRANB1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to marked antitumor and antimetastaticeffects in preclinical models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).Intriguingly, a small-molecule inhibitor of ZRANB1 destabilizes EZH2 and inhibitsthe viability of TNBC cells. In patients with breast cancer, ZRANB1 levelscorrelate with EZH2 levels and poor survival. These findings suggest thetherapeutic potential for targeting the EZH2 deubiquitinase ZRANB1.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.
