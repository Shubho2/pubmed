Here weexplored the therapeutic benefit of combining PARP and mTOR inhibitors in acontext of DNA repair deficiency and PI3K pathway activation. The combination of everolimus and olaparib was tested in BRCA2-mutated patient-derived xenografts(PDX) carrying alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. An RPPA analysis ofdifferent signalling pathways was performed in untreated and treated xenografts. Everolimus and olaparib showed marked anti-tumor activities in the monotherapysetting and high efficacy when given in combination with 100% of mice showingtumor regressions. The fraction of P-H2AX positive cells was increased in bothmonotherapy arms and strongly increased in the combination setting. Everolimusgiven as monotherapy resulted in downregulation of different proteins involved inDNA damage repair, including FANCD2, RAD50 and SUV39H1. In the combinationsetting, expression of these proteins was almost completely abolished, suggestingconvergence of PARP and mTOR in downregulation of DNA damage repair components.In conclusion, our results suggest that combining mTOR and DNA repair inhibition could be a successful strategy to treat a subset of breast cancer with BRCA2mutation and alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25640 PMCID: PMC6049870PMID: 30038706
