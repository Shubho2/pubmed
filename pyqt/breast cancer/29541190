To clarify the survivalbenefit of a peptide vaccine combined with UFT/LV as adjuvant treatment, a phase II clinical trial was conducted involving patients with stage III CRC. Allenrolled patients, whose human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A status wasdouble-blinded, were administered the same regime of a peptide vaccine and UFT/LVchemotherapy. The primary objective of the study was to compare relapse-freesurvival (RFS) in patients with HLA-A*2402 vs. those without HLA-A*2402.Secondary objectives included comparisons between the two groups regardingoverall survival, safety, tolerability and peptide-specific activities ofcytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as measured by the ELISPOT assay. Between December2009 and December 2014, a total of 46 patients were enrolled to the presentstudy. Three-year RFS was not significantly different between HLA-A*2402 matched and unmatched groups [67.8 vs. 73.6%, respectively; hazard ratio (HR)=1.254, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48-4.63; P=0.706]. Three-year RFS was significantlybetter in patients with positive CTL responses in the HLA-A*2402 matched groupcompared with those without (85.7 and 33.3%, respectively; HR=0.159, 95% CI:0.023-0.697; P=0.011). In conclusion, vaccination-induced immune responsescombined with UFT/LV were positively associated with survival benefit in patientswith HLA-A*2402-positive stage III CRC. Further study is required to clarifywhether vaccination-induced immune responses shortly following the initiation of therapy can predict the therapeutic effect and help develop a promisingtherapeutic strategy for patients with stage III CRC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7905 PMCID: PMC5835896PMID: 29541190
