However, few reports have addressed theassociation between the NLR and response to endocrine therapy. In this study, we carried out a clinical investigation to confirm whether or not the NLR predicted the response to endocrine therapy of stage IV breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study subjects were 34 patients who underwent endocrinetherapy as initial drug therapy for stage IV breast cancer. The correlationbetween NLR and prognosis, including the efficacy of endocrine therapy, wasevaluated retrospectively.RESULTS: Among the 34 patients, the NLR was high in 10 (29.4%) and low in 24(70.6%). In analysis of outcomes, the group with low NLR had a significantprolongation of progression-free survival (p=0.003), time to treatment failure(p=0.031), and overall survival (p=0.013) compared to the group with high NLR.Univariate analysis of progression-free survival found that responding totreatment [hazard ratio (HR)=4.310, p=0.004] and low NLR (HR=3.940, p=0.016) werefactors associated with a favorable prognosis. Multivariate analysis also showed that responding to treatment (HR=4.329, p=0.006) and low NLR (HR=3.930, p=0.008) were independent factors associated with a favorable prognosis.CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the NLR may represent a predictive marker for response to endocrine therapy in stage IV breast cancer.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/invivo.11292 PMCID: PMC6000781PMID: 29695577
