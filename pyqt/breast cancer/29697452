Overall survival (OS) was defined as the primary study endpoint.RESULTS: The trial was stopped early due to poor recruitment. Ninety patients (45arm A, 45 arm B) were included; median follow-up was 37.5 months. Patients in thesurgery arm had more cT3 breast cancer (22.2% vs 6.7%) and more cN2 staging(15.6% vs 4.4%). Both groups were well balanced with respect to the type offirst-line systemic treatment. Median survival in arm A was 34.6 months, versus54.8 months in the nonsurgery arm [hazard ratio (HR) 0.691, 95% confidenceinterval (95% CI) 0.358-1.333; P = 0.267]; time to distant progression was 13.9months in the surgery arm and 29.0 months in the nonsurgery arm (HR 0.598, 95% CI0.343-1.043; P = 0.0668).CONCLUSION: The prospective phase III trial ABCSG-28 (POSYTIVE) could notdemonstrate an OS benefit for surgical resection of the primary in breast cancer patients presenting with de novo stage IV disease.DOI: 10.1097/SLA.0000000000002771 PMID: 29697452
