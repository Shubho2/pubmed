This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and prognosticvalue of MCTs used by immunohistochemistry and quantum dots-based fluorescentimaging technique in BC and surrounding stroma with emphasis on the interactionbetween tumour and stroma. Moreover, the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)was analyzed to evaluate the association between MCTs mRNA expression andprognosis of breast cancer patients. Our study found that MCT1 overexpression wasobserved in hormone receptor-negative and high-proliferation subtypes. Highexpression of MCT1 and MCT4 in tumour tissues was associated with poor patientoutcome; further the correlation between MCT1 expression and poor prognosis inbreast cancer was further strengthened when combined with MCT4 overexpression in the adjacent adipose tissue. These results demonstrate that MCTs tend to play arole in the aggressive BC subtypes through the dynamic interaction between breastcancer cells and adipocytes, and developing therapeutics to block thisinteraction will be a promising strategy in cancer therapy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
