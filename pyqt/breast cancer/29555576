In this study, we showed that MORC2 was widely expressed inhuman tissues while significantly up-regulated in most cancer types usingimmunohistochemical staining and analysis of messenger RNA expression profile of more than 2000 human tissue samples from 15 different organs (lung, prostate,liver, breast, brain, stomach, colon/rectum, pancreas, ovary, endometrium, skin, nasopharynx, kidney, esophagus, and bladder). We also found that the MORC2expression level in high-grade cancer tissues was much more elevated andassociated with unfavorable pathological characteristics, poor overall survival, and disease-free survival in several kinds of cancers such as non-small cell lungcancer and breast cancer. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to predict thegenes modulated by MORC2, and the results showed that dysregulation of MORC2 intumor may take part in the cell cycle regulation and genomic instability. Weobserved that MORC2 knockdown would arrest the cell cycle progress, and thegenome of tumors with high MORC2 expression contained more point mutations andgene copy number variation, which validates our gene set enrichment analysisresults. The results also showed that MORC2 knockdown would significantly inhibitthe proliferation, colony forming, migration, and invasion in multiple cancercell lines. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of MORC2 intumorigenesis and cancer progression, and it may act as a potential diagnosticmarker and therapeutic target for these diseases.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
