Depending on various histological criteria, they aresubdivided into benign, borderline, and malignant forms. Metaplastic changesoccur, but are quite infrequent and cystic squamous metaplasia is very rare amongthe observed metaplastic changes in PT.Case: The current paper presents the case of a 41-year-old female with aprogressively enlarging swelling in the left breast. Subsequent histopathologicalexamination revealed benign PT with cystic squamous metaplasia. The previouslydone fine needle aspiration smears were also reviewed, which showed importantdiagnostic clues to this rare entity, but were ignored due to the rarity of thelesion.Conclusion: The case was presented because of its unique cytological andhistopathological morphology and also to determine the role of aspirationcytology to diagnose such a rare occurrence.PMCID: PMC5835380PMID: 29531557
