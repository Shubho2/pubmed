Laboratory and imaging features were assessed to determinevariables predictive of outcomes. Unpaired Student t tests and Fisher exact testswere used to compare responders and nonresponders categorized by changes influorodeoxyglucose avidity. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine the impact of predictors on survival after radioembolization.RESULTS: Median survival after radioembolization was 11 months (range, 1-49 mo). Most patients (18 of 26; 69%) had complete or partial response based on changesin fluorodeoxyglucose avidity. Imaging response was associated with longersurvival (P = .005). Whereas 100% of patients with PI3K pathway mutations showed an imaging response, only 45% of wild-type patients showed a response (P = .01). Median survival did not differ between PI3K pathway wild-type (10.9 mo) andmutant (undefined) patients (P = .50).CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that genomic profiling may predictwhich patients with metastatic breast cancer benefit most from radioembolization.PI3K pathway mutations are associated with improved imaging response, which isassociated with longer survival.Copyright © 2018 SIR.
