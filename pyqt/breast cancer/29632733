Here, we assessed to which extentdistinct cancer-associated fibroblast subsets impact mammary carcinoma growth andcancer cell stemness in an orthotopic murine model. We found that fibroblastsexpressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the interleukin 7 promoteroccupied mainly the tumor margin where they physically interacted with tumorcells. Intratumoral ablation of interleukin 7-expressing fibroblasts impairedbreast tumor growth and reduced the clonogenic potential of cancer cells.Moreover, cDNA expression profiling revealed a distinct oncogenic signature ofinterleukin 7-producing fibroblasts. In particular, Cxcl12 expression wasstrongly enhanced in interleukin 7-producing fibroblasts and cell type-specificgenetic ablation and systemic pharmacological inhibition revealed that theCXCL12/CXCR4 axis impacts breast tumor cell stemness. Elevated expression ofCXCL12 and other stem cell factors in primary human breast cancer-associatedfibroblasts indicates that certain fibroblast populations support tumor cellstemness and thereby promote breast cancer growth.DOI: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1414129 PMCID: PMC5889213PMID: 29632733
