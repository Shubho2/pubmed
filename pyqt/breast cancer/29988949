Thus, aberrantly expressed miRNAs disrupt tightlycontrolled RNA networks in cancer cells. Our functional screening showed thatexpression of miR-124-3p was downregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC) tissues. Here, we aimed to investigate the anti-tumor roles of miR-124-3p in PDAC cells and to identify miR-124-3p-mediated oncogenic signaling in thisdisease. Ectopic expression of miR-124-3p inhibited cancer cell migration andinvasion in PDAC cells. Moreover, restoration of miR-124-3p suppressed oncogenic signaling, as demonstrated by reduced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase,AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, in PDAC cells. Our in silicodatabase analyses and luciferase reporter assays showed that two cell-surfacematrix receptors, integrin α3 (ITGA3) and integrin β1 (ITGB1), were directlyregulated by miR-124-3p in PDAC cells. Overexpression of ITGA3 and ITGB1 wasconfirmed in PDAC clinical specimens. Interestingly, a large number of cohortanalyses from TCGA database showed that high expressions of ITGA3 and ITGB1 were significantly associated with poor prognosis of patients with PDAC. Knockdown of ITGA3 and ITGB1 by siRNAs markedly suppressed the migration and invasionabilities of PDAC cells. Moreover, downstream oncogenic signaling was inhibitedby ectopic expression of miR-124-3p or knockdown of the two integrins. Thediscovery of anti-tumor miRNAs and miRNA-mediated oncogenic signaling may providenovel therapeutic targets for the treatment of PDAC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25599 PMCID: PMC6034741PMID: 29988949
