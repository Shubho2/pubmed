Electronic address:shankar@niperhyd.ac.in.A new series of 1,2,4-triazole-linked urea and thiourea conjugates have beensynthesized and evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity against selected human cancer cell lines namely, breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231), lung (A549) prostate(DU145) and one mouse melanoma (B16-F10) cell line and compared with referencedrug. The compound 5t showed significant cytotoxicity on MCF-7 breast cancer cellline with a IC50 value of 7.22 ± 0.47 µM among all the tested compounds. Notably,induction of apoptosis by compound 5t on MCF-7 cells was evaluated usingdifferent staining techniques such as acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB),annexin V-FITC/PI, and DAPI. Further, clonogenic assay indicates the inhibitionof colony formation on MCF-7 cells by compound 5t. Moreover, the flow-cytometric analysis also revealed that compound 5t caused the arrest of cells at G0/G1 phaseof cell cycle. In addition, the compounds when tested on normal human cells(L-132) were found to be safer with low cytotoxicity profile.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
