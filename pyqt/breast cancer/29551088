A total of 83 breast masses subjected to percutaneous biopsy were included.Ultrasound elastography images before biopsy were interpreted by 3 radiologistswith and without the aid of computer-aided diagnostic system for strainelastography. The parameters evaluated by each radiologist results weresensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy, with and withoutcomputer-aided diagnostic system for strain elastography. Interobservervariability was assessed using a weighted κ test and an intraclass correlationcoefficient. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves werealso calculated.RESULTS: The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.835, 0.801, and 0.765 for readers 1, 2, and 3, respectively, without computer-aideddiagnostic system for strain elastography, and 0.900, 0.926, and 0.868,respectively, with computer-aided diagnostic system for strain elastography. The intraclass correlation coefficient between the 3 readers was 0.6713 withoutcomputer-aided diagnostic system for strain elastography and 0.811 withcomputer-aided diagnostic system for strain elastography.CONCLUSION: The proposed computer-aided diagnostic system for strain elastographysystem has the potential to improve the diagnostic performance of radiologists inbreast examination using ultrasound associated with elastography.DOI: 10.1177/1533033818763461 PMCID: PMC5882047PMID: 29551088
