The pathogenesis of CRC is associated with the processes ofactivating oncogenes and inactivating anti-oncogenes. Platelet-derived growthfactor-D (PDGF-D) was confirmed to regulate migration, invasion, proliferation,apoptosis and metastasis in various cancer cells. Overexpression of PDGF-D existsin a number of human malignancies, including pancreatic, prostate and breastcancer. However, the expression and function of PDGF-D and its associatedmolecular mechanism in CRC remain unclear. Thus, the expression of PDGF-D wasdetected in CRC tissues and human colon cancer lines. Subsequently, the effectsof PDGF-D on the invasion, migration and proliferation of cancer cells wereinvestigated. The corresponding molecular mechanism had also been explored. Thepresent study revealed that PDGF-D was upregulated not only in CRC tissues butalso in CRC cell lines, and simultaneously, facilitated the processes ofmigration, invasion and proliferation. Silencing PDGF-D in the SW480 cell lineinhibited migration, invasion and proliferation distinctly, with reducedexpression of Notch1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Furthermore, upregulatingPDGF-D in HCT116 cells led to the opposite results. These findings indicate that PDGF-D may be developed into a potential therapeutic target for CRC treatment.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7510 PMCID: PMC5777126PMID: 29434852
