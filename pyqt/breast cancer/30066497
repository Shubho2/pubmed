Eribulin treatment in the metastatic setting was categorized as early use (EU, first-/second-line) and late use (LU, third-line or later).Patient characteristics, overall survival (OS), disease response (per treatingphysician), and adverse events (AEs) rates in each group, respectively, arereported.RESULTS: Overall 252 eCRFs were completed: 125 (49.6%) EU and 127 (50.4%) LU. Themedian age at metastatic diagnosis was 53 years and 42.1% were stage IV at their initial diagnosis. The median duration of follow-up from the initiation offirst-line treatment was 24 months. Rates of disease response (complete orpartial per treating physician) were 69.9% in the EU group and 48.8% in the LUgroup. The five most commonly reported adverse events during eribulin were asfollows: fatigue (65.1%), weakness (40.1%), decreased appetite (32.5%),neutropenia (31.0%), and leukopenia (27.4%). Discontinuation of eribulin due toAE was observed in 4.0% of patients. Median OS from initiation of eribulin was23.0 months (95% CI: 18.7-27.3) among EU and 14.7 (95% CI: 12.6-16.9) among LU.CONCLUSION: In the real-world eribulin-treated mTNBC, patients have more sites ofmetastatic disease and exposure to greater numbers of prior therapies compared toRCTs. The median OS of 14.7 months among LU patients is consistent with, andslightly longer than the 13.1 months and 14.4 months reported in the EMBRACE and Study 301 clinical trials, respectively.© 2018 The Authors.
