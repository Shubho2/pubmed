A few studies have been conducted recently andhave shown a relationship between reduced HRV and conditions that lead toneuropathic pain (NP). In this study, we aimed to investigate whether NP isassociated with changes in cardiac sympathovagal activity in patients with breastcancer (BC). Methods We used the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms andSigns (LANSS) questionnaire to evaluate NP in 70 patients with BC. The patientswere subjected to a 24-h Holter ECG monitorization to determine heart ratevariability (HRV). Standard deviation (SD) of the normal-to-normal RR intervals(SDNN), SD of the mean of the RR intervals (SDAAN), mean of the SD of the NNinterval (SDNN Index), low-frequency component/high-frequency component ratio(LF/HF), and the mean heart rate of the patients were recorded. Results Accordingto the LANSS questionnaire, 18 (25.7%) of the patients were classified as NP (+).The SDNN (P = 0.001), SDAAN (P = 0.003), and SDDN index (P = 0.007) weresignificantly lower in patients with NP than in patients without NP, whereasLF/HF ratio (P = 0.000) and mean heart rate were found to be significantly higherin patients with NP (P = 0.006). Conclusion According to our findings, NP (+)patients with BC had increased cardiac sympathetic activity, which was suggested to be associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.DOI: 10.1080/01616412.2018.1438225 PMID: 29447081
