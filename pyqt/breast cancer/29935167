Wedescribe a novel, autosomal recessive, morphofunctional DT abnormality in inbred mice evident as columnar alternations and age-related cystic changes. Thisabnormality developed in both sexes of DBA/2Cr. Similar phenotypes were observed in A/J, C3H/He, DBA/1J, and FVB/N strains, but not in AKR/N, BALB/c, or C57BL/6N strains. In DBA/2Cr, abnormal DT localized to straight and convoluted segmentsand showed IL-36α DT injury marker expression. However, DT epithelialproliferation, examined by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, was not remarkablyaltered with the progression of abnormality. Abnormal DT epithelial cells inDBA/2Cr displayed elongated primary cilia, loose intercellular adhesions, andnumerous vesicles with altered localization of CD9, Na+/K+ATPase, and E-cadherin,indicating altered cell function, adhesion, and polarity. DBA/2Cr-typeD12Mit182-D12Mit83 was identified as a candidate locus designated DBA/2 renalcyst (drecy). Within drecy, the gene regulated by estrogen in breast cancerprotein (Greb1) transcript variant 2 was significantly up-regulated in DBA/2Crkidney versus C57BL/6N. Greb1 localized to DT cytoplasm in C57BL/6 and tocytoplasm and nucleus in DBA/2Cr. Greb1-overexpressing M-1 kidney cells showed analtered epithelial-mesenchyme phenotype. B6.D2-(D12Mit182-D12Mit83) congenic micecarrying drecy did not show DT abnormalities, whereas DBA/2Cr ×B6.D2-(D12Mit182-D12Mit83) mice did. Identification of this novel DT abnormality regulated by a DBA/2Cr mouse chromosome 12-derived locus and additional geneticfactors improve the understanding of DT pathogenesis.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology.
