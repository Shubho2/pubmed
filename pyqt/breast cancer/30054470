Here we report, using murine models of breast cancer, that TAMs expressing fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) and haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which are also found in human breast cancer, represent a macrophage phenotype similar tothat observed during the wound healing response. Importantly, the expression of awound-like cytokine response within the tumour is clinically associated with poorprognosis in a variety of cancers. We show that co-expression of FAP and HO-1 in macrophages results from an innate early regenerative response driven by IL-6,which both directly regulates HO-1 expression and licenses FAP expression in askin-like collagen-rich environment. We show that tumours can exploit thisresponse to facilitate transendothelial migration and metastatic spread of thedisease, which can be pharmacologically targeted using a clinically relevant HO-1inhibitor.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05346-7 PMCID: PMC6063977PMID: 30054470
