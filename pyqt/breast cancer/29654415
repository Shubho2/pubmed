PROs were assessed using the EuropeanOrganisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality-of-life (EORTCQLQ-C30) and breast cancer-specific (EORTC QLQ-BR23) questionnaires. Changes frombaseline and time to deterioration in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) wereanalyzed using linear mixed-effect and stratified Cox regression models,respectively. Exploratory analysis of area-under-the-curve for change frombaseline in pain score (AUC-pain) was performed.RESULTS: On-treatment HRQoL scores were consistently maintained from baseline andwere similar between arms. A clinically meaningful (> 5 points) reduction in painscore was observed as early as Week 8 and was maintained up to Cycle 15 in theribociclib arm. A statistically significant increase in mean AUC-pain was alsoobserved in the ribociclib arm. Scores for all other EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTCQLQ-BR23 domains were maintained from baseline and were similar between arms.CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL was consistently maintained from baseline in postmenopausalwomen with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer receiving ribociclib plus letrozole and was similar to that observed in the placebo plus letrozole arm. Together withthe improved clinical efficacy and manageable safety profile, these PRO resultsprovide additional support for the benefit of ribociclib plus letrozole in thispatient population.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4769-z PMCID: PMC6022531PMID: 29654415
