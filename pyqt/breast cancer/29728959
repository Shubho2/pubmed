These symptoms can have amajor impact on how an individual functions in all aspects of their lives. Thisreview evaluates self-reported cognitive function and its associations withneuropsychological tests and patient-reported outcomes in adult cancer patientswho received chemotherapy treatment for a solid cancer.METHODS: A search of multiple databases (Medline, Ovid at Nursing, PsycINFO,Allied and Complementary Medicine) from 1936 to 2017 was conducted, identifying1563 unique articles, of which 101 met inclusion criteria.RESULTS: Of the 101 included studies, 48 (47%) were cross-sectional and 38 (38%) longitudinal in design, with 12 (12%) randomised controlled trials. A minority(26%) incorporated a healthy control arm in the study design, whilst the majority(79%) were in women with breast cancer. There was diversity in the assessment of self-reported cognitive symptoms. A total of 43 of 44 studies that sought anassociation between self-reported cognitive function and patient-reportedoutcomes found a moderate to strong association. Overall, 31 studies showed alack of association between self-reported cognitive symptoms andneuropsychological results, whilst 14 studies reported a significant association between the two, but the association was often restricted to limited cognitivedomains.CONCLUSION: The review found widespread heterogeneity in the assessment ofself-reported cognitive symptoms and consistently absent or weak association withneuropsychological test scores.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: This research highlights the need for astandardised approach to measurement of self-reported cognitive symptoms incancer patients.DOI: 10.1007/s11764-018-0692-x PMID: 29728959
