This study examined the effects of combinedaerobic and resistance training (CART) on HRQoL and biomarkers of stress. Cancer survivors (n = 76, 91% female, 39% breast cancer, 32% gynecologic cancer) wereenrolled in CART for three 60-min sessions, weekly, for 26 weeks. Participantscompleted the National Institutes of Health's Patient Reported OutcomesMeasurement Information System (NIH PROMIS) fatigue assessment and the SF-36.Cortisol and c-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed using volunteered bloodspecimens. Baseline fatigue scores were worse for participants completingtreatment within the last year, compared to long-term survivors [F = (2,59) = 3.470, p = 0.038]. After 26 weeks, fatigue scores improved by a noteworthy two points [M = 52.72, standard deviation, SD = 10.10 vs. M = 50.67, SD = 10.14; t(48) = 1.7145, p = 0.092]. Pre- to postintervention improvements in bodily pain [M = 50.54, SD = 9.51 vs. M = 48.20, SD = 10.07; t(33) = 2.913, p = 0.006] andlimitations in social functioning [M = 50.60, SD = 9.17 vs. M = 47.75,SD = 11.66; t(33) = 2.206, p = 0.034], as well as a mean decrease of1.64 ± 10.11 mg/L in CRP levels [t(107) = 1.261, p = 5.965], were observed.Participants within 1 year of treatment completion experienced greaterimprovements in post CRP levels compared to those who had treatment 1-4 years(p = 0.030) and 5 or more years ago (p = 0.023). Physical functioning, fatigue,fear/anxiety, social role satisfaction, and CRP levels improved followingparticipation in this exercise intervention. Oncologists should considerrecommending CART as soon as medically feasible following the cessation of cancertreatment.DOI: 10.1089/biores.2018.0003 PMCID: PMC5961455PMID: 29789774
