Here, we showed that SET domain, bifurcated 1(SETDB1), a histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase, is aberrantly expressed andbehaves as an oncogenic driver in breast cancer. SETDB1 enhances c-MYC and cyclinD1 expression by promoting the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediatedtranslation of MYC/CCND1 mRNA, resulting in prominent signalling of c-MYC topromote cell cycle progression, and provides a growth/self-renewal advantage tobreast cancer cells. The activated c-MYC-BMI1 axis is essential forSETDB1-mediated breast tumourigenesis, because silencing of either c-MYC or BMI1 profoundly impairs the enhanced growth/colony formation conferred by SETDB1.Furthermore, c-MYC directly binds to the SETDB1 promoter region and enhances its transcription, suggesting a positive regulatory interplay between SETDB1 andc-MYC. In this study, we identified SETDB1 as a prominent oncogene andcharacterised the underlying mechanism whereby SETDB1 drives breast cancer,providing a therapeutic rationale for targeting SETDB1-BMI1 signalling in breast cancer.
