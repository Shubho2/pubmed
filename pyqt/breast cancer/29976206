Based on clinical experience, breast and thyroidcancer often occur metachronously or synchronously. Therefore, thyroid and breastcancer might share some common etiological factors. The relationship betweenthese diseases has attracted substantial attention, and because these two glands are both regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, such a relationship is notsurprising. A study of this relationship will be useful for obtaining a betterunderstanding of the mechanism by which these two malignancies co-occur.MAIN BODY: This study reviewed the progress in research on the roles of iodineintake, folate metabolism, obesity, gonadal hormones, and thyroid hormone inthyroid and breast cancer. These studies evaluating the etiological roles ofthese factors in linking breast and thyroid cancer might also improve ourunderstanding and identify new therapeutic approaches, such as sodium/iodidesymporter-mediated radioiodine therapy and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptorantagonists, for breast cancer. In addition, some specific treatments for eachcancer, such as radiotherapy for breast cancer or radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer, might be risk factors for secondary malignances, including breastand thyroid cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Studies of the precise relationship between the co-occurrence ofbreast and thyroid cancer will certainly improve our understanding of thebiological behaviors of these two malignancies and direct evidence-based clinicalpractice.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1436-0 PMCID: PMC6034293PMID: 29976206
