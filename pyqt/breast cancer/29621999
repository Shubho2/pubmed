There is very limited dataon BC in the Central African Republic. The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiological and histopathological characteristics of BC in Bangui.METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed cancer data registries and medicalrecords from the Pathology Unit of the National Laboratory in Bangui and theGeneral Surgery and Gyneacology service from 2003 to 2015. A questionnaire wasdesigned to collect information and data was analysed using descriptive andinferential statistical methods.RESULTS: In total, 174 cases of BC were recorded, with an average annualfrequency of13.4 cases per year. The age of the women at diagnosis varied from 16to 90 years with a median of 45.5 years and InterQuartile range (IQR) 18 years.The age group of 45-54 years represented the majority of the study population(n = 51, 29.3%).About 25.9%ofthe patients were non-educated and 85.6% lived incities. Over 48 % of the women were housewives with a moderate economic status(n = 99, 56.9%). Sixty nine percent of the specimens received at the pathologyunit were pieces of breast tumour. Invasive ductal carcinoma (n = 113, 64.9%) wasthe main histological form and most of the tumours were of Grade III (n = 14,46.7%). The only imaging assessment was ultrasound performed in (n = 53, 30.4%)women. Surgery was performed in (n = 166, 95.4%) patients, while (n = 159, 91.4%)received complementary chemotherapy. At the end of the study, 84.5%of the caseshad died, 12.1% were alive and 3.4% were considered "lost to follow-up".CONCLUSION: BC is an important public health problem and affected most of theyounger Central African women. Epidemiological and histological characteristicsare more or less common to those described other developing countries. It isimperative to improve the awareness of health care institutions and women on the burden of BC, to carry out early screening of BC, and to strengthen the capacity of women's health care system.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4256-2 PMCID: PMC5887243PMID: 29621999
