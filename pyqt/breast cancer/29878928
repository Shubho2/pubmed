The data for this study weredrawn from a larger descriptive study designed to understand the impact ofcognitive dysfunction on work-related outcomes. Breast cancer survivors completedquestionnaires regarding sleep disturbance, attentional fatigue, and demographic and medical characteristics. Sleep disturbance, a subscale of the PittsburghSleep Quality Index, is measured by asking 9 questions about sleep disturbances. Attentional fatigue was measured by the Attentional Function Index. Descriptivestatistics and multiple regression were performed to assess the impact of sleepdisturbance on attentional fatigue, controlling for covariates.RESULTS: Sixty-eight female BCS, ranging from 29 to 68 years old (mean [SD], 52.1[8.6] years old) and, on average, 4.97 (SD, 3.36) years posttreatment,participated. Thirty-four percent of BCS had poor to moderate attention function.Sleep disturbance significantly predicted attentional fatigue (P < .05),explaining 16% of the variance, F4,57 = 2.68, P < .04, R = 0.16.CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians can assess and intervene to decrease sleep disturbance,which may also improve attentional fatigue in BCS. However, sleep disturbance is only 1 contributing factor. Further investigation into factors contributing toattentional fatigue in BCS is warranted.DOI: 10.1097/NUR.0000000000000383 PMID: 29878928  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
