We aimed to identify predictors of attendance to anoncologist-referred exercise program offered during and after adjuvant breastcancer treatment.METHODS: Women with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy (n = 68)enrolled in the Nutrition and Exercise During Adjuvant Treatment (NExT) study.Supervised aerobic and resistance exercise was prescribed three times per weekduring treatment, then one to two times per week for 20 additional weeks.Predictors of attendance were identified using multivariate linear regression forthree phases of the intervention, including during (1) adjuvant chemotherapy, (2)radiation, and (3) 20-weeks post-treatment.RESULTS: Higher baseline quality of life (QoL) predicted higher attendance duringchemotherapy (β = 0.51%, 95 CI: 0.09, 0.93) and radiation (β = 0.85%, 95 CI:0.28, 1.41), and higher QoL, measured at the end of treatment, predicted higherattendance post-treatment (β = 0.81%, 95 CI: 0.34, 1.28). Being employedpre-treatment (β = 34.08%, 95 CI: 5.71, 62.45) and a personal annual income> $80,000 (β = 32.70%, 95 CI: 0.85, 64.55) predicted higher attendance duringradiation. Being divorced, separated or widowed (β = - 34.62%, 95 CI: - 56.33,- 12.90), or single (β = - 25.38%, 95 CI: - 40.64, - 10.13), relative to beingmarried/common-law, and undergoing a second surgery (β = - 21.37%, 95 CI:- 33.10, - 9.65) predicted lower attendance post-treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Demographic variables, QoL, and receipt of a second surgerysignificantly predicted attendance throughout the NExT supervised exerciseprogram. These results may help identify individuals with exercise adherencechallenges and improve the design of future interventions, including optimizingthe timing of program delivery.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4180-7 PMID: 29651596
