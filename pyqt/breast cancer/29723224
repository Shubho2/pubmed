Although anthracyclines prolong the QTc interval, it is unclear whether breast cancer patients who undergo the ACT chemotherapy regimen of anthracycline (doxorubicin: A), cyclophosphamide (C) and taxane (T) may present with QTc, QTdc and DTpTe prolongation.METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive patients with breast cancer were followedprospectively during ACT chemotherapy and were analyzed according to their QTmeasurements. QTc, QTdc and DTpTe measurements were determined by a 12-leadelectrocardiogram (EKG) prior to chemotherapy (baseline), immediately after thefirst phase of anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) treatment, and immediatelyafter T treatment. Serum troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levelswere also measured.RESULTS: Compared to baseline values, the QTc interval was significantlyprolonged after the AC phase (439.7 ± 33.2 ms vs. 472.5 ± 36.3 ms, p = 0.001) andafter T treatment (439.7 ± 33.2 ms vs. 467.9 ± 42.6 ms, p < 0.001). Troponinlevels were elevated after the AC phase (23.0 pg/mL [min-max: 6.0-85.0] vs. 6.0pg/mL [min-max: 6.0-22.0], p < 0.001) and after T treatment (25.0 pg/mL [min-max:6.0-80.0] vs. 6.0 pg/mL [min-max: 6.0-22.0], p < 0.001) compared to baselinevalues.CONCLUSION: In this prospective study of patients with non-metastatic breastcancer who underwent ACT chemotherapy, significant QTc prolongation and anelevation in serum troponin levels were observed.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196763 PMCID: PMC5933786PMID: 29723224  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
