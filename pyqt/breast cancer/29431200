Cases were dated from 1994 to 2014. We also evaluated 6cases of cutaneous breast cancer metastasis RESULTS: No PCACCs expressed GATA3.Breast cancer metastases expressed GATA3 in 100% of our studied cases.CONCLUSION: Even though GATA3 expression has been reported in many benign andmalignant adnexal tumors (mostly of sebaceous, follicular, and apocrinedifferentiation), as well as in many other neoplasms, GATA3 staining todifferentiate PCACC from skin breast cancer metastasis has a high negativepredictive value. A positive GATA3 staining in this context should permit one to rule out PCACC with a high level of confidence.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
