Previously,the differences between these two progression types did not affect thedetermination of treatment strategies since both PPL and PNM are classified asprogressive disease based on the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors(RECIST) diagnostic criteria. On the other hand, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes(TILs) are effective when used as indicators for monitoring the immune tumormicroenvironment (iTME) in the cancer host, and TILs play an important role asbiomarkers in predicting prognosis and therapeutic effects. This study focused onthe progression types of cancer in patients undergoing eribulin chemotherapy. In addition, the iTME in individuals with PPL and PNM was evaluated using TILs as a marker.METHODS: Of the 52 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer whounderwent chemotherapy with eribulin, 40 remained in the study, and 12 patientswere dropout cases. The antitumor effect was evaluated based on the RECISTcriteria using version 1.1. TILs were defined as the infiltrating lymphocyteswithin tumor stroma and were expressed in proportion to the field investigated.In PPL cases, the high-TIL group was considered as type I and the low-TIL groupwas classified as type II. In PNM cases, the high-TIL group was considered astype III and the low-TIL group was classified as type IV.RESULTS: In 19 cases, individuals with type I progression had significantlylonger progression free survival and overall survival (OS) compared to those withtype III progression (p = 0.040, p < 0.001, log-rank). Individuals with type Iprogression had significantly prolonged survival post progression compared tothose with type II progression (p = 0.048, log-rank). A multivariate analysisthat validate the effect of OS showed that these were independent factors of goodprognosis (p = 0.003; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.065) (p = 0.006; HR = 0.105).CONCLUSIONS: The effects of eribulin chemotherapy suggested that patients withprogressive-type breast cancer that proliferates in a good iTME may have a goodprognosis.DOI: 10.1186/s12967-018-1443-5 PMCID: PMC5845371PMID: 29523158
