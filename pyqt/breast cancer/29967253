However, the significance of infrequentmutations has not been fully investigated. Herein, we comprehensively assessedthe functional significance of the ERBB2 mutations in a high-throughput manner.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated the transforming activities and drugsensitivities of 55 nonsynonymous ERBB2 mutations using themixed-all-nominated-in-one (MANO) method.RESULTS: G776V, G778_S779insG, and L841V were newly revealed to be activatingmutations. Although afatinib, neratinib and osimertinib were shown to beeffective against most of the ERBB2 mutations, only osimertinib demonstrated goodefficacy against L755P and L755S mutations, the most common mutations in breastcancer. In contrast, afatinib and neratinib were predicted to be more effectivethan other inhibitors for the A775_776insYVMA mutation, the most frequent ERBB2mutation in lung cancer. We surveyed the prevalence of concurrent ERBB2 mutation with gene amplification and found that approximately 30% of ERBB2-amplifiedurothelial carcinomas simultaneously carried ERBB2 mutations, altering theirsensitivity to trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against ERBB2. Furthermore, theMANO method was applied to evaluate the functional significance of 17 compoundmutations within ERBB2 reported in the COSMIC database, revealing that compoundmutations involving L755S were sensitive to osimertinib but insensitive toafatinib and neratinib.CONCLUSIONS: Several ERBB2 mutations showed varying sensitivities toERBB2-targeted inhibitors. Our comprehensive assessment of ERBB2 mutations offersa fundamental database to help customize therapy for ERBB2-driven cancers.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0991 PMID: 29967253
