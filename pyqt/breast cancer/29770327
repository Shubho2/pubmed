The cytotoxicity of A. seyal extract was evaluated using resazurin reduction assay in 9 cell lines.Further, the protective effect of the hydroethanolic extract of A. seyal stembarks was evaluated on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene- (DMBA-) induced breastcancer rat model. Incidence, burden, volume, and histological analysis of mammarytumors were measured. The Acacia seyal extract exhibited CC50 of 100 in MCF-7cells after 24 h. In vivo, no tumors were detected in rats from the controlgroup, while 11 rats out of 12 (91.66%) developed mammary tumors in theDMBA-exposed group receiving only the vehicle. Acacia seyal extract significantly(p < 0.01) and in the dose-dependent manner reduced tumor incidence (3 rats outof 12 at the dose of 300 mg/kg), burden [62.1% (150 mg/kg) and 65.8%(300 mg/kg)], and mass. It protected rats against DMBA-induced breasthyperplasia, with an optimal effect at the dose of 300 mg/kg. Taken altogether,these results suggest that the hydroethanolic extract of Acacia seyal mightcontain phytoconstituents endowed with antitumoral properties, which couldprotect against the breast cancer induced in rats.DOI: 10.1155/2018/2024602 PMCID: PMC5889903PMID: 29770327
