Theoptimal cutoff values of CEA and CA15-3 for disease-free survival (DFS) were3.2 ng/mL and 13.3 U/mL, respectively, based on receiver operating characteristiccurve and area under the curve analyses.RESULTS: The DFS of patients with high CEA levels (CEA-high: n = 191, 5-year DFS 70.6%) was significantly worse (p < 0.0001) than that of CEA-low patients(n = 885, 5-year DFS 87.2%). There was a significant difference in DFS(p < 0.0001) between CA15-3-high and CA15-3-low patients (n = 314 and n = 762,respectively; 5-year DFS 71.8 vs. 89.3%). Significant associations between DFSand CA15-3 levels were observed irrespective of the subtypes. Multivariableanalysis indicated that tumor size, lymph node metastasis, tumor grade, and CEA(p = 0.0474) and CA15-3 (p < 0.0001) levels were independent prognostic factors(hazard ratio [HR] 1.520, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.005-2.245 for CEA; HR2.088, 95% CI 1.457-2.901 for CA15-3).CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CEA and CA15-3 levels might be usefulfor predicting the prognosis of patients with operable early breast cancerirrespective of the subtype. Serum levels at baseline may reflect tumorcharacteristics for metastatic potential even when these levels are within thenormal ranges.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1325-6 PMCID: PMC5809836PMID: 29433529
