The patients consented to return for a repeatultrasound ± mammography examination, and the degree of displacement of themarker was measured as the marker-to-residual lesion distance.RESULTS: The marker was placed after stereotactic biopsy, ultrasound-guidedbiopsy, and before/during neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in 11, 22, and 7 lesions,respectively. Surgical resection was performed for 22 of the 40 lesions, whileremaining 18 benign lesions were followed. The marker was sonographicallydetectable in 89.7% (35/39), 100% (35/35), and 100% (18/18) of the cases,respectively, at a median of 8 days, 13 weeks, and 11 months after thedeployment. The degree of displacement was lower in the ultrasound-guidedplacement group than in the stereotactic placement group (median displacement: 0 vs. 4.3 mm; p = 0.001), it was also lower in the core-needle biopsy andneoadjuvent therapy cases than in the vacuum-assisted biopsy cases (p = 0.003).At a median interval of 2.5 months after deployment, the marker remainedunchanged in location in all cases (n = 18, p = NS).CONCLUSIONS: The HydroMARK appears to be a safe and effective marker with theadvantageous characteristics of a low tendency for dislocation with time andlong-term sonographic detectability.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0854-8 PMID: 29572658
