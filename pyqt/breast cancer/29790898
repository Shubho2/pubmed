ERÎ±, PR, and HER2 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the current research focus because of thelack of effective targeted therapies. In our study, lentivirus systems were used to overexpress EZH2 and miR-1301 in TNBC cell lines. Western blot analysis andRT-qPCR were used to detect the protein and microRNA levels. The TCGA and Kaplan Meier plotter databases were used to analyze the EZH2 and miR-1301 expressionlevels in breast cancer. The effect of miR-1301 overexpression on cellproliferation, migration and colony formation were determined by using thesulforhodamine B (SRB) assay, wound healing assay and colony formation assay,respectively. Furthermore, an xenograft mouse model was used to investigate thefunction of miR-1301 overexpression in vivo. Finally, dual luciferase reporterassay was used to verify the binding site of EZH2 and miR-1301. We found thatEZH2 induced the expression of miR-1301 in two TNBC cell lines, HCC1937 andHCC1806. Overexpression of miR-1301 suppressed TNBC cell proliferation, migrationand colony formation, as well as the xenograft tumor growth in immunodeficientmice. Interestingly, miR-1301 inhibited the expression of EZH2 by binding to the 3'-UTR of EZH2 gene. These data suggest that EZH2 induces the expression ofmiR-1301 as a negative feedback control mechanism in TNBC.DOI: 10.1093/abbs/gmy050 PMID: 29790898
