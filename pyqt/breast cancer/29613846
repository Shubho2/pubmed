Materials and Methods The authorsretrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from the UK National HealthService Breast Screening Programme during a 36-month period (April 1, 2005 toMarch 31, 2008), with 3-year follow-up in women aged 50-70 years. Data on recall,cancers detected at screening, and interval cancers were available for each ofthe 84 breast screening units and for each year (n = 252). The associationbetween interval cancers and recalls was modeled by using Poisson regression onaggregated data and according to age (5-year intervals) and screening type(prevalent vs incident). Results The authors analyzed 5 126 689 screeningepisodes, demonstrating an average recall to assessment rate (RAR) of 4.56%(range, 1.64%-8.42%; standard deviation, 1.15%), cancer detection rate of 8.1 per1000 women screened, and interval cancer rate (ICR) of 3.1 per 1000 womenscreened. Overall, a significant negative association was found between RAR andICR (Poisson regression coefficient: -0.039 [95% confidence interval: -0.062,-0.017]; P = .001), with approximately one fewer interval cancer for everyadditional 80-84 recalls. Subgroup analysis revealed similar negativecorrelations in women aged 50-54 years (P = .002), 60-64 years (P = .01), and65-69 years (P = .008) as well as in incident screens (P = .001) and prevalentscreens (P = .04). No significant relationship was found in women aged 55-59years (P = .46). Conclusion There was a statistically significant negativecorrelation between RAR and ICR, which suggests the merit of a minimum threshold for RAR.
