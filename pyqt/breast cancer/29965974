We have previously described the catalyticproperties of CAIX in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, a line of cells that werederived from a patient with triple negative breast cancer. We chose this linebecause CAIX expression in breast cancer is a marker of hypoxia and aprognosticator for reduced survival. However, CAXII expression is associated withbetter survival statistics than those patients with low CAXII expression. YetCAIX and CAXII have similar catalytic activities. Here we compare the potentialroles of CAIX and CAXII in the context of TNBC and estrogen receptor(ER)-positive breast cancer. In tumor graft models, we show that CAIX and CAXIIexhibit distinct expression patterns and non-overlapping. We find the samepattern across a panel of TNBC and luminal breast cancer cell lines. This affordsan opportunity to compare directly CAIX and CAXII function. Our data suggest thatCAIX expression is associated with growth potentiation in the tumor graft modeland in a TNBC line using knockdown strategies and blocking activity with animpermeant sulfonamide inhibitor, N-3500. CAXII was not associated with growthpotentiation. The catalytic activities of both CAIX and CAXII were sensitive toinhibition by N-3500 and activated at low pH. However, pH titration of activityin membrane ghosts revealed significant differences in the catalytic efficiencyand pKa values. These features provide evidence that CAIX is a more efficientenzyme than CAXII at low pH and that CAIX shifts the equilibrium between CO2 and bicarbonate in favor of CO2 production by consuming protons. This suggests thatin the acidic microenvironment of tumors, CAIX plays a role in stabilizing pH at a value that favors cancer cell survival.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199476 PMCID: PMC6028082PMID: 29965974
