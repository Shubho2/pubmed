While the hamartomas are benign, patientswith CS have increased risk of osteosarcoma and of breast, thyroid, endometrial, soft-tissue and colonic neoplasms. Germline mutations of phosphatase and tensinhomolog (PTEN) are implicated in CS and in the development of osteosarcoma. Wereport a patient with CS who presented with osteosarcoma, ganglioneuromatosis anda benign breast mass. Osteosarcoma, as presentation of CS, is rare (only onereport in the English literature). Genomic DNA from the patient's peripheralblood was quantified by spectrophotometry, then underwent sequence enrichment,polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing. Molecular analysisrevealed a non-synonymous c.17_18delAA frameshift mutation in exon 1 of PTEN and a c.116G>T (p.R39L) missense mutation of serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) ofunknown significance.CONCLUSION: We report a patient with CS presenting with ganglioneuromatosis,benign breast mass and osteosarcoma, harboring a novel molecular alteration inPTEN which to our knowledge has not been previously reported.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/cgp.20069 PMCID: PMC5892603PMID: 29496690
