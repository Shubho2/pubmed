The primary analysisincluded studies that used identical regimens in the experimental and controlgroups, but varied only dose density. A secondary analysis included studies that used either different drugs or doses in the experimental and the control groups. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals were computed for disease-freesurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) and pooled in a meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression explored drug schedules utilized in control groupsand the influence of clinicopathologic variables on benefit from dose-densetherapy.RESULTS: The primary analysis included 5 studies comprising 9819 patients whilethe secondary analysis included 6 studies comprising 9679 patients. Dose-densetreatment significantly improved DFS (HR 0.85, p < 0.001) and OS (HR 0.86,p = 0.008) in the primary analysis. Similar results were observed in thesecondary analysis. Dose-dense schedule was important primarily in studiesutilizing paclitaxel every 3 weeks as the control group (interaction p = 0.04 forDFS interaction p = 0.001 for OS). A significantly greater relative magnitude of benefit was observed in pre-menopausal women and those with nodal involvement,but there was no influence of hormone receptor status on results.CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant dose-dense regimens improve breast cancer outcomes. Itremains uncertain whether the observed benefit reflects the impact of dosedensity or the inferiority of paclitaxel every 3 weeks as a control group.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4710-5 PMID: 29423899
