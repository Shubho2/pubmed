Recent studies declared thatmicroRNA-222 is aberrantly expressed in various malignancies. The goal of thisresearch was to measure the expression level of has-miR-222-3P and reveal itsdiagnostic and prognostic importance in breast malignancy.METHODS: In this study, 40 pairs of cancerous and matched adjacent non-cancerous breast tissue were collected from patients, and real-time PCR was used to measurethe relative expression of miR-222.RESULTS: Our study clarified that microRNA-222 is enhanced in tumor tissues incomparison with normal tissue margins (p â‰¤ 0.05) and overexpression of miR-222was not associated with clinicopathological factors such as age, BMI, menopausal status, histological type, grade, stage, tumor size, lymph node metastasis (p >0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis displayed anoptimum cutoff point of < 4.17 to prove that miR-222 is a useful biomarker inbreast cancer diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings on miR-222 suggest that it could be a potentiallyuseful target for control and management of breast malignancy.PMID: 29739090
