Several chromatin associated enzymes have been shownto influence post-translational modification (PTM) in DNA, histones, andnon-histone proteins. Any deregulation of this core group of enzymes often leads to cancer development. Ubiquitylation of histone H2B in mammalian cells wasidentified over three decades ago. An exciting really interesting new gene (RING)family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, known as RNF20 and RNF40, monoubiquitinateshistone H2A at K119 or H2B at K120, is known to function in transcriptionalelongation, DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair processes, maintenance ofchromatin differentiation, and exerting tumor suppressor activity. RNF20 issomatically altered in breast, lung, prostate cancer, clear cell renal cellcarcinoma (ccRCC), and mixed lineage leukemia, and its reduced expression is akey factor in initiating genome instability; and it also functions as one of the significant driving factors of oncogenesis. Loss of RNF20/40 and H2Bmonoubiquitination (H2Bub1) is found in several cancers and is linked to anaggressive phenotype, and is also an indicator of poor prognosis. In this review,we summarized the current knowledge of RNF20 in chronic inflammation-drivencancers, DNA DSBs, and apoptosis, and its impact on chromatin structure beyondthe single nucleosome level.Â© 2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BSR20171287 PMCID: PMC6043722PMID: 29934362
