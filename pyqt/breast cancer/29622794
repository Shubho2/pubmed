In this study, we found that Rab34 isover-expressed in aggressive breast cancer cells, implying a potential role ofRab34 in breast cancer. Silencing Rab34 by shRNA inhibits cell migration,invasion, and adhesion of breast cancer cells. Rab34 specifically binds to thecytoplasmic tail of integrin β3, and depletion of Rab34 promotes the degradation of integrin β3. Interestingly, EGF induces the translocation of Rab34 to themembrane ruffle, which is greatly enhanced by the expression of Src kinase.Accordingly, Rab34 is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src at Y247 residue. A mutantmimicking phosphorylated form of Rab34 (Rab34Y247D) promotes cell migration andinvasion. Importantly, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 is inhibited incells in suspension, and increased with the cells re-adhesion. In addition,Rab34Y247D promotes cell adhesion, and enhances integrin β3 endocytosis andrecycling. The results uncover a role of Rab34 in migration and invasion ofbreast cancer cells and its involvement in cancer metastasis, and provide a novelmechanism of tyrosine phosphorylation of Rab34 in regulating cell migration,invasion, and adhesion through modulating the endocytosis, stability, andrecycling of integrin β3.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0202-7 PMID: 29622794
