Now cellularcarriers are widely investigated to deliver anticancer agents. As an idealcellular candidate, human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells(hUC-MSCs) possess inherent tropism potential to tumor. Here, we constructedhUC-MSCs carrying transferrin-inspired-nanoparticles that containdoxorubicin(hUC-MSCs-Tf-inspired-NPs) to achieve enhanced anti-tumor efficacy andmade an evaluation. Results represented that hUC-MSCs-Tf-inspired-NPs not onlyexhibit the controlled-release property of Tf-inspired-NPs, but also integratetumor tropism and penetrative abilities of MSCs. The tumor volume of nude micebearing breast cancer MCF-7 treated with hUC-MSCs-Tf-inspired-NPs, was remarkablyreduced compared to those treated with free drug or Tf-inspired-NPs. Thus,Tf-inspired-NPs loaded hUC-MSCs have a potential to deliver anticancer drugs.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1434185 PMID: 29457930
