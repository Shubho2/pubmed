WASH complexes activate Arp2/3 complexes atthe surface of endosomes and thereby fission transport intermediates containingendocytosed receptors, such as α5β1 integrins. How WASH complexes are assembledin the cell is unknown. Here, we identify the small coiled-coil protein HSBP1 as a factor that specifically promotes the assembly of a ternary complex composed ofCCDC53, WASH, and FAM21 by dissociating the CCDC53 homotrimeric precursor. HSBP1 operates at the centrosome, which concentrates the building blocks. HSBP1depletion in human cancer cell lines and in Dictyostelium amoebae phenocopiesWASH depletion, suggesting a critical role of the ternary WASH complex for WASHfunctions. HSBP1 is required for the development of focal adhesions and of cellpolarity. These defects impair the migration and invasion of tumor cells.Overexpression of HSBP1 in breast tumors is associated with increased levels ofWASH complexes and with poor prognosis for patients.© 2018 The Authors.DOI: 10.15252/embj.201797706 PMCID: PMC6028030 [Available on 2019-07-02]PMID: 29844016
