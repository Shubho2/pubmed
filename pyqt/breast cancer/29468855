For cervical cancer, efficacy and safety analysis resultsof a 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and long-term impact of reduced dose of quadrivalent vaccine were updated. Brief introduction of KEYNOTE trialsof pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction betweenprogrammed death (PD)-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, followed. Tailoredsurveillance programs for gynecologic cancer related with Lynch syndrome andupdate on sentinel lymph node mapping were reviewed for uterine corpus cancer.For ovarian cancer, 5 topics were selected including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerasesinhibitors and immunotherapy. The other potential practice changers covered inthis review were lymphadenectomy in advanced disease, secondary cytoreductivesurgery in recurrent disease, weekly dose-dense regimen for first-linechemotherapy, incorporation of bevacizumab maintenance in platinum-sensitiverecurrent disease, and effect of platinum-free interval prolongation. Conflictingopinions of academic societies on periodic pelvic examination were introduced in conjunction with relevant literature review. For the field of radiation oncology,results of 2 big trials, The Postoperative Radiation Therapy in EndometrialCarcinoma-3 and Gynecologic Oncology Group-258, for endometrial cancer and recentadvance in high-dose-rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer were reported. Topicsfor breast cancer covered adjuvant capecitabine after preoperative chemotherapy, adjuvant pertuzumab and trastuzumab in early human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2-positive disease, olaparib for metastatic cancer in patients with agermline BRCA mutation, 20-year risks of recurrence after stopping endocrinetherapy at 5 years, and contemporary hormonal contraception and the risk ofbreast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018.
