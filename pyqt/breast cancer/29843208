TACC2 is involved in tumorigenesis of variety ofcancers but the clinical significance of TACC2 protein in hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC) is still unclear.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the expression of TACC2 in HCC anddetermine if clinical significance and prognostic relevance exists.METHODS: We performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot to examine TACC2mRNA and protein expression in paired HCC tissues and matched adjacentnon-cancerous tissues. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 106 postoperativeHCC samples.RESULTS: There was higher expression of TACC2 protein and mRNA in HCC tissue.Immunohistochemistry analysis showed high expression of TACC2 in HCC tissue andwas significantly associated with the capsular extension, tumor recurrence andshortened overall and disease free survival. The Cox regression analysissuggested that a high expression of TACC2 was an independent prognostic factorfor HCC patients.CONCLUSION: This finding suggests that TACC2 may be a useful tool as a candidate biomarker to predict the recurrence and prognosis of HCC.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-170091 PMID: 29843208
