China.Ultrasound is an easily accessible and cost-effective imaging method that is not associated with radiation exposure. Ultrasound-guided wire localization is areliable method for resecting non-palpable breast lesions. Preoperativeultrasound-guided wire localization has the advantage of a shorter operativetime, and the breast lesions may be accurately excised with less tissue injury.We herein report an unusual case of an ectopic breast localization wire in thepleural cavity in a 47-year-old female patient with a history of right-sidedbreast cancer, who received left segmental mastectomy due to a newly identifiedleft-sided breast lesion. The wire was identified with intraoperative X-ray andcomputed tomography imaging and was successfully removed under thoracoscopicguidance. The patient recovered uneventfully. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on localization wire-related complications in the Englishliterature.DOI: 10.3892/mco.2018.1593 PMCID: PMC5920465PMID: 29725536
