However, theimpact of the individual provider or institution is not well understood, andcould provide key insights to biases in the decision-making process.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 29,358 women 65 years or older derivedfrom the SEER-Medicare linked database with localized breast cancer diagnosedfrom 2000 to 2009. Multilevel, multivariable logistic models were employed, with odds ratios (ORs) used to describe the impact of demographic or clinicalcovariates, and the median OR (MOR) used to describe the relative impact of thesurgeon and institution.RESULTS: Six thousand five hundred ninety-four women (22.4%) underwentmastectomy. Unadjusted rates of mastectomy ranged from 0% in the bottom quintile of surgeons to 58.0% in the top quintile. On multivariable analysis, theindividual surgeon (MOR 1.97) had a greater impact on mastectomy than did theinstitution (MOR 1.71) or all other clinical and demographic variables excepttumor size (OR 3.06) and nodal status (OR 2.95). Surgeons with more years inpractice, or those with a lower case volume were more likely to performmastectomy (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: The individual surgeon influences the likelihood of mastectomy forthe treatment of localized breast cancer. Further research should focus onphysician-related biases that influence this decision to ensure patient autonomy.DOI: 10.1097/SLA.0000000000002698 PMID: 29465454
