Epub 2018 Feb 28.Molecular mechanism of amygdalin action in vitro: review of the latest research.Liczbiński P(1), Bukowska B(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Biophysics of Environmental Pollution, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection , University of Lodz , Lodz , Poland.Amygdalin, named as 'laetrile' and 'vitamin B-17' was initially supposed to be a safe drug for cancer treatment and was recognized by followers of naturalmedicine since it has been considered to be hydrolyzed only in cancer cellsreleasing toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and thus destroying them. Unfortunately, current studies have shown that HCN is also released in normal cells, thereforeit may not be safe for human organism. However, there have still been researchworks conducted on anti-cancer properties of this compound. In vitro experiments have shown induction of apoptosis by amygdalin as a result of increasedexpression of Bax protein and caspase-3 and reduced expression of antiapoptoticBcL-2protein. Amygdalin has also been shown to inhibit the adhesion of breastcancer cells, lung cancer cells and bladder cancer cells by decreased expression of integrin's, reduction of catenin levels and inhibition of the Akt-mTORpathway, which may consequently lead to inhibition of metastases of cancer cells.It has also been revealed that amygdalin in renal cancer cells increasedexpression of p19 protein resulting in inhibition of cell transfer from G1-phase to S-phase, and thus inhibited cell proliferation. Other studies have indicatedthat amygdalin inhibits NF-kβ and NLRP3 signaling pathways, and consequently has anti-inflammatory effect due to reducing the expression of proinflammatorycytokines such as pro-IL-1β. Moreover, the effect of amygdalin on TGFβ/CTGFpathway, anti-fibrous activity and expression of follistatin resulting inactivation of muscle cells growth has been reported. This compound might beapplicable in the treatment of various cancer cell types.DOI: 10.1080/08923973.2018.1441301 PMID: 29486614
