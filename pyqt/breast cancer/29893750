In addition, the relationship between the primary tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax)value and the presence of distant metastasis and axillary involvement wasevaluated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Whole-body F-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging of493 patients (mean age; 54.6±13.2 years) diagnosed with primary breast cancerwere analyzed retrospectively. PET/CT imaging was obtained 60 min after theintravenous administration of F-FDG. F-FDG uptake of the lesions was assessed by calculating the SUVmax. Histopathological analyses were carried out on the basis of biopsy samples before PET/CT. For histopathological staging, the Scarff Bloom Richardson classification system was utilized, and patients were classified into luminal A, luminal B, triple-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptortype-2 molecular subtypes.RESULTS: 82.9% of the patients had invasive ductal carcinoma, 5.8% had invasivelobular carcinoma, 4.2% had apocrine carcinoma, 3.8% had mucinous carcinoma, and 3.4% has mixed carcinoma. Although the highest mean SUVmax was calculated inapocrine tumors (12.4±7.2), the lowest mean SUVmax was calculated in lobularcarcinoma (6.8±4.6), and a statistically significant difference was found betweenthe histological groups (P<0.001). F-FDG uptake was reported to be significantly higher in the triple-negative subtype than the luminal types, and in the luminal B subtype than the luminal A subtype. A statistically significant relation wasfound between primary tumor SUVmax and distant nodal, organ metastasis (P=0.003and <0.001, respectively).CONCLUSION: Increased primary tumor F-FDG uptake was associated with aggressivemolecular subtypes in this study. The relationship of distant nodal and organmetastasis with primary tumor SUVmax showed that increased F-FDG uptake isimportant in terms of management of therapy and prognosis.DOI: 10.1097/MNM.0000000000000856 PMID: 29893750
