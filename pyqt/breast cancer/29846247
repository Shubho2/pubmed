The application of multidrug combination and adjuvant-drug carriers is a feasible strategy to overcome the limitations while minimizing the dosage of single drug and acquiring the synergistic effects in tumor therapy.However, the systemic toxicity, drug resistance, and tumor recurrence are stillunavoidable. Here we develop core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) to encapsulatepaclitaxel (PTX) and gemcitabine (GEM) for breast cancer therapy. We find thatthe NPs could encapsulate PTX and GEM, with an encapsulation efficiency of 96.3and 95.13%, respectively. Moreover, the drug loading of these NPs is 2.71% (PTX) and 2.64% (GEM). Notably, the co-delivery of GEM and PTX performs enhancedanticancer effect compared with the PTX alone or GEM alone therapy at the sameconcentration, which indicates a synergistic effect. Moreover, encapsulation ofPTX and GEM by methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide-coglycolide) also showsenhanced anticancer effects (81.5% tumor inhibition) and reduced systemictoxicity in vivo compared with free drugs (65% tumor inhibition). Together withthose results, co-delivery of PTX and GEM by methoxy poly(ethyleneglycol)-poly(lactide-coglycolide) might have important potencies in clinicalapplications for breast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000631 PMID: 29846247
