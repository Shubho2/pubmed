Primaryoutcomes were the differences between affected and non-affected sides for thefollowing: shoulder strength measured by dynamometry, shoulder range of motionmeasured by goniometry, and lymphedema measured by volume. As a secondaryoutcome, health-related quality of life (HRQL) was assessed by the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for breast cancer (FACT-B+4) questionnaires. Changes over time were tested for SLNB and ALNDusing univariate repeated measures analysis of variance. Generalized estimatingequation models were constructed to assess the effect of SLNB and ALND over time.RESULTS: After 5 years, the ALND group had significant loss of strength forinternal rotators (1.39 kg, p = 0.001) and significant arm volume increase(132.45 mL, p = 0.031). The ALND group had a greater number of patients withclinically relevant internal rotator strength loss (38.7 vs. 13.6%, p = 0.012)and a greater number of lymphedema requiring treatment (33.3 vs. 3.4%, p < 0.001)than the SLNB group. A loss of strength for shoulder external rotators, shoulder range of motion, and HRQL in physical and arm domains persisted at 5 years inboth SLNB and ALND groups.CONCLUSION: These results could help understand and plan the prevention, needs,and long-term care of breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4186-1 PMID: 29651594
