However, we know little about how ER+cells activate RET signaling and initiate an endocrine resistant phenotype. Here we show that both ER+ endocrine resistant and sensitive breast cancers have afunctional RET tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, but that endocrine sensitivebreast cancer cells lack RET ligands that are necessary to drive endocrineresistance. Transcription of one RET ligand, GDNF, is necessary and sufficient toconfer resistance in the ER+ MCF-7 cell line. Endogenous GDNF produced byendocrine resistant cells is translated, secreted into the media, and activatesRET signaling in nearby cells. In patients, RET ligand expression predictsresponsiveness to endocrine therapies and correlates with survival. Collectively,our findings show that ER+ tumor cells are "poised" for RET mediated endocrineresistance, expressing all components of the RET signaling pathway, but endocrinesensitive cells lack high expression of RET ligands that are necessary toinitiate the resistance phenotype.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0194023 PMCID: PMC5880349PMID: 29608602  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
