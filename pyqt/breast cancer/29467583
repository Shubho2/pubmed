Kaplan-Meier methodand log-rank test were used for survival analysis.Results: Eight thousand nine hundred one patients with initial MBC had boneinvolvement, accounting for 3.6% of the entire cohort and 62.5% of the patientswith initial MBC. Also, 70.5% of patients with bone metastasis were hormonereceptor (HR) positive (HR+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-:57.6%; HR+/HER2+: 12.9%). Patients with initial bone metastasis had a better5-year survival rate compared to those with initial brain, liver, or lungmetastasis. HR+/HER2- and HR+/HER2+ breast cancer had a propensity of bonemetastasis in the entire cohort and were correlated with better prognosis inpatients with initial bone metastasis. Local surgery had significantly improvedoverall survival in initial MBC patients with bone metastasis.Conclusion: Our study has provided population-based estimates of epidemiologiccharacteristics and prognosis in patients with bone metastasis at the time ofbreast cancer diagnosis. These findings would lend support to optimalsurveillance and treatment of bone metastasis in breast cancer.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S155524 PMCID: PMC5811177PMID: 29467583
