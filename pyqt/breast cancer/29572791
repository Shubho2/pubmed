This chapter reviewspatient colon, breast, and ovarian tumors in 3-dimensional Gelfoam® histoculture maintaining in vivo-like expression of the important tumor antigens, for example TAG-72 and CEA. We have also reviewed that fluorescent antibodies can targettumors in Gelfoam® histoculture, thereby providing an assay for individualpatients for sensitivity to therapeutic antibodies which have become so importantin immuno-oncology and other cancer therapies.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7745-1_4 PMID: 29572791
