[Epub ahead of print]HetRCNA: a novel method to identify recurrent copy number alternations fromheterogeneous tumor samples based on matrix decomposition framework.Xi J, Li A, Wang M.A common strategy to discovering cancer associated copy number aberrations (CNAs)from a cohort of cancer samples is to detect recurrent CNAs (RCNAs). Although theprevious methods can successfully identify communal RCNAs shared by nearly alltumor samples, detecting subgroup-specific RCNAs and their related subgroupsamples from cancer samples with heterogeneity is still invalid for theseexisting approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel integrated method calledHetRCNA, which can identify statistically significant subgroup-specific RCNAs andtheir related subgroup samples. Based on matrix decomposition framework withweight constraint, HetRCNA can successfully measure the subgroup samples bycoefficients of left vectors with weight constraint and subgroup-specific RCNAsby coefficients of the right vectors and significance test. When we evaluateHetRCNA on simulated dataset, the results show that HetRCNA gives the bestperformances among the competing methods and is robust to the noise factors ofthe simulated data. When HetRCNA is applied on a real breast cancer dataset, our approach successfully identifies a bunch of RCNA regions and the result is highlycorrelated with the results of the other two investigated approaches. Notably,the genomic regions identified by HetRCNA harbor many breast cancer related genesreported by previous researches.DOI: 10.1109/TCBB.2018.2846599 PMID: 29994262
