In particular, triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) comprise a heterogeneous group of basal-like tumorslacking estrogen receptor (ERÎ±), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 (ErbB2).TNBC represents 15-20% of all breast cancers and occurs frequently in women under50 years of age. Unfortunately, these patients lack targeted therapy, aretypically high grade and metastatic at time of diagnosis. The mechanismsregulating metastasis remain poorly understood. We have previously shown that thekisspeptin receptor, KISS1R stimulates invasiveness of TNBC cells. In thisreport, we demonstrate that KISS1R signals via the secreted extracellular matrix protein, fibulin-3, to regulate TNBC invasion. We found that the fibulin-3 geneis amplified in TNBC primary tumors and that plasma fibulin-3 levels are elevatedin TNBC patients compared to healthy subjects. In this study, we show that KISS1Ractivation increases fibulin-3 expression and secretion. We show that fibulin-3regulates TNBC metastasis in a mouse experimental metastasis xenograft model and signals downstream of KISS1R to stimulate TNBC invasion, by activating matrixmetalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and the MAPK pathway. These results identifyfibulin-3 as a new downstream mediator of KISS1R signaling and as a potentialbiomarker for TNBC progression and metastasis, thus revealing KISS1R andfibulin-3 as novel drug targets in TNBC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25682 PMCID: PMC6059025PMID: 30046386
