Detailed individual searchstrategies for Cinahl, Cochrane Library Central, LILACS, PubMed, and Web ofScience were developed in January 2016. A manual search was also performed tofind additional references. A grey literature search was executed by using GoogleScholar. Two researchers independently read the titles and abstracts from everycross-reference. The risk of bias of the included studies was analyzed by theCochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool. The quality of evidence and grading of strength of recommendations was assessed using Grades of Recommendation,Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).RESULTS: seven controlled clinical trials were identified. The controls used werecalendula, placebo, institutional preference / usual care, Aquaphor®, RadiaCare™,and Lipiderm™. The studies were pooled using frequency of events and risk ratiowith 95% confidence intervals, in subgroups according to radiation dermatitisgraduation.CONCLUSION: based on the studies included in this review, trolamine cannot beconsidered as a standardized product to prevent or treat radiation dermatitis in patients with breast and head and neck cancer.DOI: 10.1590/1518-8345.2035.2929 PMCID: PMC5942864PMID: 29742271
