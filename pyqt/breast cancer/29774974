[Epub ahead of print]Stiffness reconstruction methods for MR elastography.Fovargue D(1), Nordsletten D(1), Sinkus R(1)(2).Author information: (1)Imaging Sciences & Biomedical Engineering, King's College London, London, UK.(2)Inserm U1148, LVTS, University Paris Diderot, University Paris 13, Paris,75018, France.Assessment of tissue stiffness is desirable for clinicians and researchers, as itis well established that pathophysiological mechanisms often alter the structuralproperties of tissue. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) provides an avenuefor measuring tissue stiffness and has a long history of clinical application,including staging liver fibrosis and stratifying breast cancer malignancy. Avital component of MRE consists of the reconstruction algorithms used to derivestiffness from wave-motion images by solving inverse problems. A large range ofreconstruction methods have been presented in the literature, with differingcomputational expense, required user input, underlying physical assumptions, and techniques for numerical evaluation. These differences, in turn, have led tovarying accuracy, robustness, and ease of use. While most reconstructiontechniques have been validated against in silico or in vitro phantoms,performance with real data is often more challenging, stressing the robustnessand assumptions of these algorithms. This article reviews many current MREreconstruction methods and discusses the aforementioned differences. The materialassumptions underlying the methods are developed and various approaches for noisereduction, regularization, and numerical discretization are discussed.Reconstruction methods are categorized by inversion type, underlying assumptions,and their use in human and animal studies. Future directions, such as alternativematerial assumptions, are also discussed.Â© 2018 The Authors. NMR in Biomedicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/nbm.3935 PMID: 29774974
