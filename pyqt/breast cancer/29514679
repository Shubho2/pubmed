The primary outcome for the model was the incrementalcost-utility ratio (ICUR), defined as the program's cost per quality-adjustedlife year (QALY) gained. Three screening strategies providing by community healthservice for women aged 35 to 69 years was compared regarding to differentintervals.RESULT: The probability of the ICUR being below 20 272USD (i.e., triple theannual gross domestic product [3 GDPs]) per QALY saved was 100% for annualscreening strategy and screening every three years. Only when the attendance ratewas > 50%, the probability for annual screening would be cost effective > 95%.The probability for the annual screening strategy being cost effective couldreach to 95% for a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 2 GDPs when the compliance ratefor transfer was > 80%. When 10% stage I tumors were detected by screening, theprobability of the annual screening strategy being cost effective would be up to 95% for a WTP > 3 GDPs.CONCLUSION: Annual community-based breast cancer screening was cost effective fora WTP of 3 GDP based on the incidence of breast cancer in Tianjin, China.Measures are needed to ensure performance indicators to a desirable level for thecost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4168-1 PMCID: PMC5840933PMID: 29514679
