MSCs asnonhematopoietic stem cells affect tumor, epithelial cells by alterationproliferative capacity, morphology, and aggregation pattern of tumor cells.Materials and Methods: This research aimed to further elucidate the MSCs effects in the progress of proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis in breast cancer bygene expression analysis in human breast cancer cell lines exposed to MSCsconditioned media (CM). Expression pattern of two genes, including survivin(Birc5) as anti-apoptotic gene and serine threonine kinase 15 as proliferativegene, were studied.Results: Anti-apoptotic and proliferative genes were up-regulated in co-cultured breast tumor cells with MSCs-CM that correlate with tumor progression and poorprognosis.Conclusion: Our results and other findings indicate the interaction of breasttumor cells with MSCs through paracrine factors. Also, the applications of MSCsas therapeutic tools are facing controversial concerns.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.177213 PMID: 29516916
