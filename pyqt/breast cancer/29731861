Previously, the utility of detectingthe loss of BAP1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and p16-deletion by fluorescencein situ hybridization has been identified in several studies. However,NF2-associated examinations have not been performed. The present study aimed toevaluate the expression of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and tafazzin (TAZ)protein, which are associated with NF2 gene mutations, in malignant mesothelioma (MM) and reactive mesothelial cells (RMCs). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embeddedtissues from 31 MM and 33 RMC samples were analyzed. The expression of YAP1 andTAZ protein were examined by IHC. Positivity for YAP1 was identified 27/31 MM and15/33 RMC samples. Positivity for TAZ was identified in 28/31 MM and 18/33 RMCsamples. Using the optimal cutoff points determined by the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve, a positive IHC result for YAP1 and TAZ was 74% sensitiveand 94% specific for detecting MM. The results indicate that increased expressionof YAP1 and TAZ may be associated with mesothelial tumorization, and aid in thediagnosis of MM.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8225 PMCID: PMC5920880PMID: 29731861
