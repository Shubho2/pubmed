This is aretrospective review of health records to collect data on delays, patients'clinical data, biological features of the tumour and information on treatment.Mortality data from the National Death Index.RESULTS: In 493 evaluable patients, the median of days from the first symptom to mammography, biopsy, and surgery was 41, 57, and 92, respectively. The median of days from screening mammography to biopsy and surgery was 10 and 51,respectively. From biopsy to surgery, the median was 34 days in every case. Over the last 5 years, an increase in biopsy-surgery delay has been observed(p = 0.0001). Tumour stages I and II vs. stage III (RR 1.74. 95% CI 1.08-2.80,p = 0.027), diagnosis in screening (RR 0.66. 95% CI 0.45-0.96, p = 0.030), anduse of magnetic resonance imaging (RR 2.08. 95 CI 1.21-3.56, p = 0.008) conditiona greater biopsy-surgery delay. No influence of delays on survival has beenidentified.CONCLUSIONS: Delays in diagnosis and surgery in the case of women diagnosed onthe basis of symptoms may be improved. There is a temporary tendency to a greaterdelay in surgery. Some clinical and biological factors must be taken into accountto optimise delays. Survival results are not adversely affected by delays.DOI: 10.1007/s12094-018-1867-7 PMID: 29633184
