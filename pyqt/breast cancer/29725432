Predictingpatient survival is critical for the clinical management of breast cancer brainmetastasis (BCBM). The present study was designed to develop and evaluate aprognostic model for patients with newly diagnosed BCBM. Based on the clinicaldata of patients with BCBM treated in the Affiliated Hospital of Academy ofMilitary Medical Sciences (Beijing, China) between 2002 and 2014, a nomogram was developed to predict survival using proportional hazards regression analysis. Themodel was validated internally by bootstrapping, and the concordance index(c-index) was calculated. A calibration curve and c-index were used to evaluatediscriminatory and predictive ability, in order to compare the nomogram withwidely used models, including recursive partitioning analysis (RPA), gradedprognostic assessment (GPA) and breast-graded prognostic assessment (Breast-GPA).A total of 411 patients with BCBM were included in the development of thispredictive model. The median overall survival time was 14.1 months. Statisticallysignificant predictors for patient survival included biological subtype,Karnofsky performance score, leptomeningeal metastasis, extracranial metastasis, the number of brain metastases and disease-free survival. A nomogram forpredicting 1- and 2-year overall survival rates was constructed, which exhibited good accuracy in predicting overall survival with a concordance index of 0.735.This model outperformed RPA, GPA and Breast-GPA, based on the comparisons of the c-indexes. The nomogram constructed based on a multiple factor analysis was able to more accurately predict the individual survival probability of patients withBCBM, compared with existing models.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8259 PMCID: PMC5920309PMID: 29725432
