In recent years, newer HER2-directedagents and novel treatment strategies have been developed with ongoingimprovements in overall outcomes. However, with the addition of newer agents,there is an increasing need to risk stratify patients to maximize efficacy andminimize toxicity of treatment. De-escalation of therapy with the potential toshorten the duration of adjuvant therapy and minimize chemotherapy administrationin patients with favorable disease can be considered. On the other hand,escalation of therapy with the addition of novel HER2-directed agents andextended duration of therapy in patients at high risk of relapse can help improvelong-term cure rates. Herein, we discuss recent developments in neoadjuvant andadjuvant strategies for the treatment of potentially curable HER2+ breast cancer.DOI: 10.1177/1758835918775697 PMCID: PMC6048669PMID: 30034547
