Epub 2018 Feb 26.Racial/ethnic disparities in de novo metastases sites and survival outcomes forpatients with primary breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer.Akinyemiju T(1)(2), Sakhuja S(1), Waterbor J(1)(2), Pisu M(2)(3), AltekruseSF(4).Author information: (1)Department of Epidemiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham,Alabama.(2)Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.(3)Division of Preventive Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham,Birmingham, Alabama.(4)Cancer Statistics Branch, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.Racial disparities in cancer mortality still exist despite improvements intreatment strategies leading to improved survival for many cancer types. In this study, we described race/ethnic differences in patterns of de novo metastasis andevaluated the association between site of de novo metastasis and breast,prostate, and colorectal cancer mortality. Data were obtained from theSurveillance Epidemiology and Ends Results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2013 and included 520,147 patients ages ≥40 years with primary diagnosis of breast,colorectal, or prostate cancer. Site and frequency of de novo metastases to four sites (bone, brain, liver, and lung) were compared by race/ethnicity usingdescriptive statistics, and survival differences examined using extended Coxregression models in SAS 9.4. Overall, non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks (11%) were morelikely to present with de novo metastasis compared with NH-Whites (9%) orHispanics (10%). Among patients with breast cancer, NH-Blacks were more likely tohave metastasis to the bone, (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.15-1.37), brain (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.57-3.25), or liver (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.35-1.93), while Hispanics were lesslikely to have metastasis to the liver (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.60-0.97) comparedwith NH-Whites. Among patients with prostate cancer, NH-Blacks (1.39, 95% CI:1.31-1.48) and Hispanics (1.39, 95% CI: 1.29-1.49) were more likely to havemetastasis to the bone. Metastasis to any of the four sites evaluated increasedoverall mortality by threefold (for breast cancer and metastasis to bone) to17-fold (for prostate cancer and metastasis to liver). Racial disparities inmortality remained after adjusting for metastasis site in all cancer typesevaluated. De novo metastasis is a major contributor to cancer mortality in USAwith racial differences in the site, frequency, and associated survival.© 2018 The Authors.
