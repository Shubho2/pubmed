Here, we report the final safety, immunogenicity and survival results after neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive neoadjuvant SB3 or TRZ for 8 cycles concurrently with chemotherapy (4 cycles of docetaxel followedby 4 cycles of 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide). Patients thenunderwent surgery, followed by 10 cycles of adjuvant SB3 or TRZ as randomised.End-points included safety, immunogenicity, event-free survival (EFS) and overallsurvival through the adjuvant period.RESULTS: Of 875 patients randomised, 764 (SB3, n = 380; TRZ, n = 384) completedthe study. The median follow-up duration was 437 days in the SB3 group and 438days in the TRZ group. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events wascomparable between groups (SB3, 97.5%; TRZ, 96.1%) during the overall studyperiod. Up to the end of study, the overall incidence of antidrug antibody waslow in both treatment groups (3 patients each). EFS was comparable between groupswith a hazard ratio (SB3/TRZ) of 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.59-1.51) andEFS rates at 12 months of 93.7% for SB3 and 93.4% for TRZ.CONCLUSIONS: Final safety, immunogenicity and survival results of this studyfurther support the biosimilarity established between SB3 and TRZ.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02149524); EudraCT (2013-004172-35).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
