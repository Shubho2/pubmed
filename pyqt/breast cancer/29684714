In thisstudy, aICAM-1 was radioiodinated with 125I/131I in high radiochemical yield and the probes for TNBC tumor targeting and radioimmunotherapy were evaluated intumor-bearing mice. High and specific accumulation of 125I-aICAM1 in TNBCMDA-MB-231 tumor was observed in SPECT imaging and the tumor grew was inhibitedobviously by 131I-aICAM1. Thus, the radioiodinated aICAM1 could serve aspotential agents for TNBC theranostics.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.apradiso.2018.04.005 PMID: 29684714
