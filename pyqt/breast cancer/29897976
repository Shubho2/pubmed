We aim to examine whether the dependent coverage expansionunder the Affordable Care Act (ACA-DCE) implemented in 2010 was associated withchanges in time to treatment among women diagnosed with early stage breastcancer.METHODS: A total of 7,176 patients diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in2007-2009 (pre-ACA) and 2011-2013 (post-ACA) were identified from the NationalCancer Database. A quasi-experimental design difference-in-differences (DD)approach was used, with patients aged 19-25 (targeted by the policy) consideredas the intervention group, and patients aged 26-34 years (not affected by thepolicy) as the control group. Changes in the following treatment outcomes wereexamined: time from diagnosis to surgery, time from surgery to adjuvantchemotherapy, and time from adjuvant chemotherapy to radiation.RESULTS: Compared with the control group of patients aged 26-34, young patientsaged 19-25 experienced a statistically nonsignificant decrease of 2.7 percentage points (95% CI [-1.2, 6.5]) in the uninsured rate. This did not translate intomore reduction in delays to surgery (DD = 2.7 days, 95% CI [-3.2, 8.3]),chemotherapy (DD = -1.0 days, 95% CI [-7.2, 5.2]) or radiation (DD = 5.3 days,95% CI [-15.6, 26.3]) in the younger cohort than the older cohort.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: No significant changes in time to treatment were foundamong young women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer after theimplementation of the ACA-DCE. Future studies examining impacts of health carepolicy reform on breast cancer care are warranted to include patients fromlow-income families and to consider effects from Medicaid expansion.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198771 PMCID: PMC5999229PMID: 29897976
