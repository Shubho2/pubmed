China.Cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) serves an important role in inhibiting anti-tumor immune response in the majority of solid tumors. However, alimited number of studies reported the function of CTLA-4 in luminal BHER2-negative breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate theexpression of tumor and interstitial CTLA-4 in luminal B HER2-negative breastcancer tissues. The percentage of patients with tumor and interstitial CTLA-4+was 41.2% (42/102) and 46.1% (47/102), respectively. There was a positiveassociation between tumor CTLA-4 expression and interstitial CTLA-4 expression(P<0.05). The disease-free survival (DFS) of the tumor CTLA-4+ group wassignificantly shorter compared with patients with tumor CTLA-4- (mean, 89.070 vs.39.022 months; P<0.0001). Additionally, the DFS of interstitial CTLA-4+ group wasshorter compared with the interstitial CTLA-4- group (mean, 85.526 vs. 46.574months; P<0.0001). Tumor and interstitial CTLA-4 expression may have prognosticpredicting value in luminal B HER2-negative breast cancer. The present study may provide the basis for the use of a CTLA-4 blocker in patients with luminal BHER2-negative breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7991 PMCID: PMC5840684PMID: 29552143
