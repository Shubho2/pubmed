[Epub ahead of print]Frequent downregulation of LRRC26 by epigenetic alterations is involved in themalignant progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Miyagawa Y(1), Matsushita Y(1), Suzuki H(2), Komatsu M(1), Yoshimaru T(1), KimuraR(1), Yanai A(1), Honda J(3), Tangoku A(4), Sasa M(5), Miyoshi Y(6), KatagiriT(1).Author information: (1)Division of Genome Medicine, Institute for Genome Research, TokushimaUniversity, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan.(2)Department of Molecular Biology, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Hokkaido060-8556, Japan.(3)Department of Surgery, National Hospital Organization Higashitokushima MedicalCenter, Tokushima 779-0193, Japan.(4)Department of Thoracic and Endocrine Surgery and Oncology, Institute of HealthBiosciences, The University of Tokushima Graduate School, Tokushima 770-8503,Japan.(5)Department of Surgery, Tokushima Breast Care Clinic, Tokushima 770-0052,Japan.(6)Department of Surgery, Division of Breast and Endocrine Surgery, Hyogo Collegeof Medicine, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 663-8501, Japan.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), defined as breast cancer lacking estrogen- and progesterone‑receptor expression and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2) amplification, is a heterogeneous disease. RNA-sequencing analysis of15 TNBC specimens and The Cancer Genome Atlas-TNBC dataset analysis identifiedthe frequent downregulation of leucine-rich repeat-containing 26 (LRRC26), which negatively regulates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling, in TNBC tissues.Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and bisulfite pyrosequencing analysesrevealed that LRRC26 was frequently silenced in TNBC tissues and cell lines as a result of promoter methylation. LRRC26 expression was restored by5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5'-aza-dC) treatment in HCC1937 TNBC cells, which lackLRRC26 expression. Notably, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of LRRC26expression significantly enhanced the anchorage-independent growth, invasion and migration of HCC70 cells, whereas ectopic overexpression of LRRC26 in BT20 cells suppressed their invasion and migration. Conversely, neither knockdown noroverexpression of LRRC26 had an effect on cell viability in the absence of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulation. Meanwhile, overexpression of LRRC26 causedthe reduction of TNF-α-mediated NF-κB luciferase reporter activity, whereasdepleting LRRC26 expression resulted in the upregulation of TNF-α-mediated NF-κB downstream genes [interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-1].Taken together, these findings demonstrate that LRRC26 is frequentlydownregulated in TNBC due to DNA methylation and that it suppresses theTNF-α-independent anchorage-independent growth, invasion and migration of TNBCcells. Loss of LRRC26 function may be a critical event in the aggressiveness ofTNBC cells through a TNF-α/NF-κB-independent mechanism.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4301 PMID: 29512727
