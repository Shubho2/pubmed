The aims ofthis study were: (1) to assess quality of life (QOL) and health status ofIndonesian women with BC symptoms before definitive diagnosis; (2) to compare QOLand health status between women with BC symptoms before definitive diagnosis and Indonesian women in general; (3) to evaluate the association between demographic variables (age, residence, social economic status and education level) and QOLwithin the Indonesian women with BC symptoms before definitive diagnosis.METHODS: We used WHOQOL-BREF to measure QOL and EQ-5D-5L for health status.Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used to compare QOL and health status between women with BC symptoms and women from the general Indonesianpopulation in order to control for confounders. Regression analyses were used fortesting the association between the demographic variables, QOL, and healthstatus.RESULTS: In comparison with the data from the women from the general population(n = 471), the women with BC symptoms (n = 132) reported lower QOL, especially inphysical and psychological domains. They also reported more problems in alldimensions of health status. Higher education and monthly income were positively associated with QOL and health status among the women with BC symptoms.CONCLUSION: Before receiving a definitive diagnosis, women who visit hospitalswith symptoms of BC, report a lower QOL and health status than women in general. Our results suggest that healthcare providers should provide targeted strategies for women with BC symptoms to improve their QOL.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200966 PMCID: PMC6053201PMID: 30024978
