[Epub ahead of print]Cox regression analysis with missing covariates via nonparametric multipleimputation.Hsu CH(1)(2), Yu M(3).Author information: (1)1 Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Mel and Enid Zuckerman Collegeof Public Health, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.(2)2 University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.(3)3 Surveillance Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and PopulationSciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville,MD, USA.We consider the situation of estimating Cox regression in which some covariatesare subject to missing, and there exists additional information (includingobserved event time, censoring indicator and fully observed covariates) which maybe predictive of the missing covariates. We propose to use two working regressionmodels: one for predicting the missing covariates and the other for predictingthe missing probabilities. For each missing covariate observation, these twoworking models are used to define a nearest neighbor imputing set. This set isthen used to non-parametrically impute covariate values for the missingobservation. Upon the completion of imputation, Cox regression is performed onthe multiply imputed datasets to estimate the regression coefficients. In asimulation study, we compare the nonparametric multiple imputation approach with the augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW) method, which directlyincorporates the two working models into estimation of Cox regression, and thepredictive mean matching imputation (PMM) method. We show that all approaches canreduce bias due to non-ignorable missing mechanism. The proposed nonparametricimputation method is robust to mis-specification of either one of the two workingmodels and robust to mis-specification of the link function of the two workingmodels. In contrast, the PMM method is sensitive to misspecification of thecovariates included in imputation. The AIPW method is sensitive to the selection probability. We apply the approaches to a breast cancer dataset fromSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program.DOI: 10.1177/0962280218772592 PMID: 29717943
