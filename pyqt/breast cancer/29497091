Early changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levelmay provide early response prediction, but the impact of tumor heterogeneity isunknown. Here we use plasma samples from patients in the randomized phase IIIPALOMA-3 study of CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib and fulvestrant for women withadvanced breast cancer and show that relative change in PIK3CA ctDNA level after 15 days treatment strongly predicts PFS on palbociclib and fulvestrant (hazardratio 3.94, log-rank p = 0.0013). ESR1 mutations selected by prior hormonetherapy are shown to be frequently sub clonal, with ESR1 ctDNA dynamics offering limited prediction of clinical outcome. These results suggest that early ctDNAdynamics may provide a robust biomarker for CDK4/6 inhibitors, with early ctDNAdynamics demonstrating divergent response of tumor sub clones to treatment.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03215-x PMCID: PMC5832789PMID: 29497091  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
