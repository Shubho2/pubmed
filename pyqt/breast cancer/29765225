This studywas conducted with the aim, primarily, to assess the overall incidence and riskof common toxicities associated with bevacizumab in patients with advanced ormetastatic breast cancer and, secondarily, to descriptively review study results concerning a potential correlation between bevacizumab-induced hypertension andits efficacy for breast cancer treatment.Methods: We carried out a meta-analysis of relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) identified from a database search (Cochrane Library and PubMed) and,additionally, by reviewing previous reviews and meta-analyses. Overall incidence rates, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed withthe random- or fixed-effect models, depending on the level of heterogeneityacross the included trials. The primary clinical outcomes were high-grade adverseevents commonly reported with bevacizumab therapy.Results: We included 6,260 patients with advanced-stage breast cancer from 12RCTs in the meta-analysis. Five types of high-grade (Grade 3 or 4) adverse drugevents were identified as being correlated with bevacizumab treatment versusalternative treatment with statistical significance: hypertension (OR 5.67, 95%CI 3.02-10.65), proteinuria (OR 10.09, 95% CI 4.79-21.27), bleeding (OR 3.45, 95%CI 2.25-5.30), cardiac toxicity (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.29-3.59), and neutropenicfever (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.15-2.00). The prognostic value of bevacizumab-inducedhypertension for its antitumor efficacy among patients with breast cancer remainscontroversial, with mixed results presented in the five retrospective studiesthat were identified from our additional literature search.Conclusion: The addition of bevacizumab to anticancer therapy was associated witha significant increase in the risk of high-grade adverse events, includinghypertension, proteinuria, bleeding, cardiac toxicity, and neutropenic feveramong patients with advanced-stage breast cancer. Although several retrospective studies suggested a predictive importance of hypertension secondary tobevacizumab therapy, the role of elevated blood pressure as a prognosticbiomarker for its antitumor efficacy remains controversial, and furtherprospective trials are required to confirm such a correlation.DOI: 10.2147/TCRM.S148840 PMCID: PMC5939922PMID: 29765225
