Electronic address:fayyaz.mazari@nhs.net.(2)Leeds Breast Unit, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, UK.AIM: To assess the safety of selective use of triple assessment with omission of radiological assessment proposed in patients <40-years old.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively for all patients seen in the one-stop breast clinic between January 2014 and August 2015. Demographics,symptoms, diagnostics, and treatment details were recorded. Subgroup and logisticregression analysis was performed to identify predictors for breast cancer.RESULTS: Of the 3,305 patients included, 95.6% (n=3,161) were first-timereferrals. 57.6% (n=1,903) had a breast lump, and 4% (n=133) had a high-riskfamily history; 75.6% (n=2,499) underwent imaging and 16.7% (n=552) underwent abiopsy. The median age was 29 years (interquartile range [IQR]=25-34). Breastcancer was diagnosed in 29 cases (0.88%) and 3.2% (n=105) had surgery. Medianreferral-to-diagnosis time was 13 days (IQR=9-14) and referral-to-surgery timewas 44 days (IQR=34-95). Patients with breast cancer were significantly older (33versus 28 years, p=0.016). All patients were first-time referrals. Most patients had a breast lump with low suspicion on clinical examination and breast canceridentified on imaging. Time-to-diagnosis (12 versus 14 days, p=0.017) andtime-to-surgery (37 versus 67 days, p=0.012) was significantly shorter in thebreast cancer group. Comparative older age (odds ratio [OR]=1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.15) and breast lump (OR=11.43,95% CI: 2.72-48.07) were the only significant predictors of cancer on uni/multivariate regression.CONCLUSIONS: Triple assessment is also the best practice for all patients in the younger age group. This cohort should not be treated any differently regardingone-stop clinic infrastructure as the cancers detected were not clinicallymalignant. Missed cancers in this age group would have significant personal,clinical, and legal consequences.Copyright Â© 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
