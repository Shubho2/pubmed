The methodology involves a competitive DNA-target miRNAhybridization assay performed on the surface of magnetic microbeads (MBs) andamperometric transduction at screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs). The targetmiRNA competes with a synthetic fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-modified miRNA with an identical sequence for hybridization with a biotinylated andcomplementary DNA probe (b-Cp) immobilized on the surface ofstreptavidin-modified MBs (b-Cp-MBs). Upon labeling, the FITC-modified miRNAattached to the MBs with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-FITC Fabfragments and magnetic capturing of the MBs onto the working electrode surface ofSPCEs. The cathodic current measured at -0.20 V (versus the Ag pseudo-referenceelectrode) was demonstrated to be inversely proportional to the concentration of the target miRNA. This convenient biosensing method provided a linear rangebetween 0.7 and 10.0 nM and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2 nM (5 fmol in 25 μLof sample) for the synthetic target miRNA without any amplification step. Anacceptable selectivity towards single-base mismatched oligonucleotides, a highstorage stability of the b-Cp-MBs, and usefulness for the accurate determination of miRNA-21 in raw total RNA (RNAt) extracted from breast cancer cells (MCF-7)were demonstrated.DOI: 10.3390/s18030863 PMCID: PMC5877363PMID: 29543716  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
