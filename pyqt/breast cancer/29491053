The present study investigated theantitumor effect of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitor in combination with thetankyrase-1 (TNKS1) inhibitor on TNBC cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the antitumor effects of combination therapy with PLK1 and TNKS1 inhibitor using cell viability analysis, apoptosis assay and transwell assay for cell invasion and migration in TNBC cells.RESULTS: Combination treatment with PLK1 and TNKS1 inhibitors not only inhibited the invasion and migration capacity of TNBC cells, but also increased theapoptosis and cell death of TNBC cells. The viability of TNBC cells with lowexpression of β-catenin and high expression of PLK1 was not affected by treatmentwith PLK1 inhibitor. However, the combination treatment with the TNKS1 inhibitor significantly decreased cell invasion and migration and increased apoptosis.CONCLUSION: Combination therapy of PLK1 and TNKS1 inhibitors may improve thetherapeutic efficacy of the current treatment for TNBC.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12352 PMID: 29491053  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
