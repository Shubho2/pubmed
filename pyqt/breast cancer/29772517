We aimed toevaluate the risk pattern of developing DM, with respect to the occurrence ofIBTR, in a large series of patients homogeneously treated by conservative surgery(QUART) with a considerably long follow-up.METHODS: Piecewise exponential model was used to investigate DM dynamicsconditioning on known prognostic factors and IBTR occurrence as time dependentcovariate. The model was extended to account for the timescale induced by IBTR,namely the time elapsed since IBTR to the endpoint.RESULTS: Among 2851 BCE patients receiving QUART, 209 were assessable for IBTR.After a median follow-up of 129 months, 588 patients presented DM (CCI = 27.3%)as first event and 92 (CCI = 48.8%) following IBTR. Primary tumor size and nodal status confirmed their prognostic value. The hazard for DM was early and high in Estrogen Receptor (ER) negative BC patients; while it was initially low butincreases during follow-up in ER positive cases. Patients experiencing IBTRshowed DM dynamic similar to that following primary tumor, with a suddenincreased risk within 24 months from surgery, regardless the time elapsed sinceQUART.CONCLUSION: BC patients experiencing IBTR showed a sudden and sustained risk ofDM following surgery. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that IBTRoccurrence might act as a "time resector" for risk of DM, and provide a rationalefor proper surveillance guidelines and systemic therapy for optimizing BCrecurrence and appropriate choice of treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
