We collected 156 MMBC (136 cases with 2 foci, 20 cases with 3foci) and 130 UFBC samples from patients hospitalized in Yuhuangding Hospital,Yantai, from January 2005 to December 2015. The outlier genes were screened bycDNA expression microarray and validated by RT-PCR.RESULTS: 18 overexpressed and 22 underexpressed genes were identified in thedifferential analysis, including family genes ABCC11, ABCB5 and PRODH, PROL1.Noteworthily, ABCC11 was significantly upregulated, while ABCB3 wasdownregulated, which were confirmed by RT-PCR results.CONCLUSION: The differential expression pattern of ABCC11 and ABCB5 genes mayserve as outliers, potentially associated with incidence of MMBS.PMID: 29552773
