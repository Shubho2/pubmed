The integrity of the genome depends on proper execution of the cellcycle, which can be altered through mechanotransduction pathways as the tumormicroenvironment stiffens during tumorigenesis. Here, we show that signalingdownstream of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) or TGFβ, known inducers ofepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), also promotes multinucleation in stiffmicroenvironments through Snail-dependent expression of the filament-formingprotein septin-6, resulting in midbody persistence, abscission failure, andmultinucleation. Consistently, we observed elevated expression of Snail andseptin-6 as well as multinucleation in a human patient sample of metaplasticcarcinoma of the breast, a rare classification characterized by deposition ofcollagen fibers and active EMT. In contrast, a soft microenvironment protectedmammary epithelial cells from becoming multinucleated by preventing Snail-inducedupregulation of septin-6. Our data suggest that tissue stiffening duringtumorigenesis synergizes with oncogenic signaling to promote genomicabnormalities that drive cancer progression.Significance: These findings revealtissue stiffening during tumorigenesis synergizes with oncogenic signaling topromote genomic abnormalities that drive cancer progression.
