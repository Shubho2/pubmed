Successful experiments in inhibiting the growth of human cancer celllines using Saudi plants were published over the last three decades. Up to date, there is no Saudi anticancer plants database as a comprehensive source for theinteresting data generated from these experiments. Therefore, there was a needfor creating a database to collect, organize, search and retrieve such data. As aresult, the current paper describes the generation of the Saudi anti-human cancerplants database (SACPD). The database contains most of the reported informationabout the naturally growing Saudi anticancer plants. SACPD comprises thescientific and local names of 91 plant species that grow naturally in SaudiArabia. These species belong to 38 different taxonomic families. In Addition, 18 species that represent16 family of medicinal plants and are intensively sold inthe local markets in Saudi Arabia were added to the database. The websiteprovides interesting details, including plant part containing the anticancerbioactive compounds, plants locations and cancer/cell type against which theyexhibit their anticancer activity. Our survey revealed that breast, liver andleukemia were the most studied cancer cell lines in Saudi Arabia with percentagesof 27%, 19% and 15%, respectively. The current SACPD represents a nucleus around which more development efforts can expand to accommodate all future submissionsabout new Saudi plant species with anticancer activities. SACPD will provide anexcellent starting point for researchers and pharmaceutical companies who areinterested in developing new anticancer drugs.
