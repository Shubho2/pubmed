Theaim of this study was to describe the clinicopathologic features of breast cancerdiagnosed in our facility and to discuss their implications for cancer screening.METHODS: A retrospective review of the forms, slides, and results of breastcancer cases received in our facility over an 8-year period was carried out, aswell as a systematic review of the characteristics of breast cancer in Nigeria,Africa, the US, and the UK.RESULT: A total of 832 cancers were seen with a mean age of 49 years. Most cases (97%) were invasive ductal carcinomas not otherwise specified, high grade(41.9%), and unassociated with ductal carcinoma in situ (52.3%). Triple-negative tumors were the commonest immunohistochemical type seen (42.1%), and these wereless likely to have an intraductal component (p = 0.0048). Luminal-type tumourswere more likely to be low grade (p = 0.0005). The majority of cases presented inadvanced stages with no statistically significant difference among the different immunohistochemical subtypes (p = 0.7949).CONCLUSION: The significant epidemiological and biological differences betweenbreast cancer in Lagos and in western populations are important for theestablishment of an effective breast cancer screening programme uniquely tailoredfor the Nigerian population.Â© 2018 S.
