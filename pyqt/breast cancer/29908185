About 20-30% of all breast cancers overexpress HER2/neureceptors. Lapatinib is a dual tyrosin kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER2. Itexhibits its anticancer effect via blocking intracellular domain of HER2 receptorin breast cancer. Lapatinib belongs to class II of BSC classification due to its poor solubility restricting its clinical application. Due to presence of HER2receptor on cardiomyocytes, it is associated with generation of cardiotoxicity.The present study was aimed to design a PEGylated liposomal formulation ofLapatinib and evaluate its anticancer potential. Lapatinib liposomes wereprepared using lipid layer hydration method and its characterization was done by determining its particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and in vitrorelease profiling. The anti-tumor activity of PEGylated liposomal formulation wasevaluated in xenografted tumor induced by MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells in chickembryos. The anti-tumor effect of lapatinib was enhanced by its PEGylatedliposomal preparation as it led to the reduction in tumor size to a greaterextent compared to the embryos treated with free lapatinib. Flowcytometricanalysis and immunoflurescence study using cleaved PARP antibody demonstrated theenhanced apoptotic potential of PEGylated liposomes of lapatinib. SGOT levels,marker for cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, significantly decreased in serum ofembryos treated with PEGylated liposomes of lapatinib compared to free drugtreated embryos. Hence, the PEGylated liposomal formulation of lapatinib can beused as a therapeutic strategy against HER2 positive breast cancer either aloneor in combination with conventional anticancer agents and hormonal therapies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
