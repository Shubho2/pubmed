The clinical materials of includedpatients were retrospectively analyzed. The immunohistochemical assay andreal-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay were applied to examine theexpression of mRNA and protein of PD-L1 in breast cancer specimens of 112 casesand paired tumor-adjacent tissue specimens of 57 cases. The relationship between PD-L1 protein expression and clinicopathological features of patients wasanalyzed.Results: PD-L1 protein was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm. The positive rateof PD-L1 expression in invasive ductal carcinoma was 19.6% (22/112), and thepositive rate of PD-L1 expression of tumor-adjacent normal tissues was 3.5%(2/57), indicating that the positive rate of PD-L1 expression of canceroustissues was significantly higher than that of in tumor-adjacent normal tissues (P< 0.05); the positive expression of PD-L1 was not related with the patients' age,menopause history, family history of breast cancer, tumor size, and location ofthe tumor (P > 0.05) while it was related with lymph node metastasis, the clinic staging, and histopathological grading (P < 0.05). Real-time PCR was applied todetect the mRNA expression of PD-L1 in breast-invasive ductal carcinoma with the mean ΔCt value of 7.79 ± 2.25. However, the mRNA expression of PD-L1 in normaltumor-adjacent tissues was of low expression with the mean ΔCt value of 12.37 ±3.33. The difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05).Conclusion: The expression of PD-L1 in breast-invasive ductal carcinoma wassignificantly increased, and it was related to histological grading, clinicalstaging, and lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. PD-L1 may be a significantmarker for the prognosis of breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_602_17 PMID: 29516978
