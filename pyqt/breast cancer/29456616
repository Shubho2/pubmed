This study aims to determine if the MIRcorrelates directly with five-year survival in patients diagnosed with the tenmost common types of cancer in metropolitan Lima.Materials and methods: The Metropolitan Lima Cancer Registry (RCLM in Spanish)for 2004-2005 was used to determine the number of new cases and the number ofdeaths of the following cancers: breast, stomach, prostate, thyroid, lung, colon,cervical, and liver cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukaemia. To determine the five-year survival, the five-year vital status of cases recordedwas verified in the National Registry of Identification and Civil Status (RENIEC in Spanish). A linear regression model was used to assess the correlation between[1 - MIR] and total observed five-year survival for the selected cancers.Results: Observed and estimated five-year survival determined by [1 - MIR] foreach neoplasia were thyroid (66.7%, 86.7%), breast (69.6%; 68%), prostate (64.3%,63.8%) and cervical (50.1%, 58.5%), respectively. Pearson's r coefficient for thecorrelation between [MIR - 1] and observed survival was = 0.9839. Using thecoefficient of determination, it was found that [1 - MIR] (X) captures the 96.82%of observed survival (Y).Conclusion: The Mortality-Incidence Ratio complement [1 - MIR] is an appropriate tool for approximating observed five-year survival for the ten types of cancersstudied. This study demonstrates the validity of this model for predictingfive-year survival in cancer patients in metropolitan Lima.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.799 PMCID: PMC5813917PMID: 29456616
