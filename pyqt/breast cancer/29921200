[Epub ahead of print]Different Targeting Strategies For Treating Breast Cancer Bone Metastases.Irshad I(1), Varamini P(1).Author information: (1)Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006. Australia.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in womenworldwide. Breast cancer tends to metastasize to bone. Around 70% of the breastcancer patients eventually develop bone metastasis. After the bone invasion,metastatic cells disrupt the balance between osteoblastic and osteoclasticactivities, leading to skeletal complications, characterized by pain andpathological fractures and hence worsening the patient's quality of life. Oncetumor invades the bone, it is hard to treat it with, the so-far availabletreatments options (e.g. bisphosphonates and denosumab). Bone metastasis shouldbe essentially controlled, in cancer treatment and there is a strong need toexplore new, more efficient therapeutic targets. This review discusses the bonephysiological processes and the recent advances in exploring different pathwaysinvolved in bone metastasis. Furthermore, some novel treatment options, which areunder preclinical and clinical investigations, are highlighted.CONCLUSION: A deeper understanding of these metastatic pathways can provideoncology researchers with novel avenues for treating bone metastasis, one of the main challenges to cure breast cancer. The restoration of healthy boneenvironment will not only improve the patient's quality of life but also reduces the tumor burden.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1381612824666180619165728 PMID: 29921200
