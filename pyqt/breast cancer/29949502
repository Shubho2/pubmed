Eltrombopag, athrombopoetin receptor agonist used in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenicpurpura, is reported in in vitro studies as an inhibitor of intestinal BCRP butnot an inhibitor of hepatic BCRP. Thus, the present study evaluates the effect oftherapeutic doses of eltrombopag on the clinical pharmacokinetics of intravenous ceftriaxone.METHODS: Healthy adult (n=12) were treated with oral doses of eltrombopag (0, 25 or 50 mg) 28 and 4 h prior to intravenous ceftriaxone administration (1g). Serialblood samples were collected up to 48 h after ceftriaxone administration andplasma samples were analysed by LC-MS/MS using 50 μL aliquots (totalconcentration) and 100 μL (unbound concentration).RESULTS: A method to analyze total and unbound ceftriaxone in plasma usingLC-MS/MS was developed and validated with linearity from 1 to 200 μg/mL. Bothmethods are sensitive, precise and accurate with coefficients of variation lessthan 15% in the study of inter- and intra-assay precision and accuracy.Ceftriaxone pharmacokinetics in healthy adults were described using abicompartmental model, with a mean clearance of 0.96 L/h (CI95% 0.71-1.20) andAUC0-∞of 1106 mg.h/mL (CI95% 811-1400) for volunteers that received onlyceftriaxone; clearance of 0.95 L/h (CI95% 0.77-1.13) and AUC0-∞ of 1083 mg.h/mL(CI95% 876-1290) for volunteers that received ceftriaxone plus 25 mg ofeltrombopag and clearance of 0.96 L/h (CI95% 0.74-1.19) and AUC0-∞ of 1072mg.h/mL (CI95% 872-1273) for volunteers that received ceftriaxone plus 50 mg ofeltrombopag.CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support the existence of a clinicalpharmacokinetic drug interaction involving hepatic BCRP in human subjectsreceiving intravenous ceftriaxone and oral eltrombopag. This article is open toPOST-PUBLICATION REVIEW.
