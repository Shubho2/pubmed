The development of the anti-HER2 class of drugs,first with trastuzumab, followed closely by lapatinib, pertuzumab, and T-DM1, hasimproved outcomes dramatically. Nevertheless, metastatic HER2+ breast cancerremains an incurable disease and new therapeutic options are needed.Additionally, the rapid changes in treatment standards 5 years ago have leftunanswered numerous questions, including the "real-life" benefit of pertuzumaband T-DM1, since both the CLEOPATRA and EMILIA trials were conducted inpopulations that no longer exist in practice and, moreover, on the role ofendocrine therapy in HER2+ disease. Furthermore, despite significant researchefforts, including translational efforts and new imaging techniques, nopredictive biomarkers have been clinically validated and therefore a more refinedapproach to treatment tailoring remains beyond our reach. Finally, a betterunderstanding of resistance to currently existing anti-HER2 agents and of therole played by the microenvironment (e.g. immune system) and of interconnectedsignalling pathways (e.g. PI3K-mTOR-AKT) is at the core of clinical trialsexploring new drugs and new regimens. These include the combination of anti-HER2 agents and anti-PD-1/PDL-1, PI3K inhibitors and CDK 4/6 inhibitors, as well as a host of new panHER inhibitors, drug antibody conjugates and anti-HER antibodies, which may, in coming years further push the boundaries of what we can do for our patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
