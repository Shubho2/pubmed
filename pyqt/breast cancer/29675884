DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression, thuscharacterizing tumour heterogeneity by epigenetic features can be clinicallyinformative. In this study, we explored specific prognosis-subtypes based on DNA methylation status using 669 breast cancers from the TCGA database. Ninesubgroups were distinguished by consensus clustering using 3869 CpGs thatsignificantly influenced survival. The specific DNA methylation patterns werereflected by different races, ages, tumour stages, receptor status, histological types, metastasis status and prognosis. Compared with the PAM50 subtypes, whichuse gene expression clustering, DNA methylation subtypes were more elaborate and classified the Basal-like subtype into two different prognosis-subgroups.Additionally, 1252 CpGs (corresponding to 888 genes) were identified as specific hyper/hypomethylation sites for each specific subgroup. Finally, a prognosismodel based on Bayesian network classification was constructed and used toclassify the test set into DNA methylation subgroups, which corresponded to theclassification results of the train set. These specific classifications by DNAmethylation can explain the heterogeneity of previous molecular subgroups inbreast cancer and will help in the development of personalized treatments for thenew specific subtypes.Â© 2018 The Authors.
