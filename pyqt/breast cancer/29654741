Here, we show that RHBDF1 plays a significant role incolorectal cancer (CRC) formation and that the RHBDF1 expression level is higher in CRC than in corresponding normal tissues. Moreover, RHBDF1 promotes cellproliferation, invasion and migration in vitro. Furthermore, throughoverexpression and silencing of RHBDF1 and the mediator complex, our studydemonstrates that RHBDF1 may positively regulate adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)in the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway to increase the expression levels ofMMP-14 and Twist, which act as important epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition(EMT) stimulating factors. Additionally, RHBDF1 may regulate c-myc and CyclinD1expression to influence cell proliferation. Finally, RHBDF1 overexpression andsilencing influence CRC growth in BALB/c nude mice. In summary, our findingsdemonstrate that the regulatory effects of RHBDF1 on EMT and on cellproliferation are partially attributable to the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
