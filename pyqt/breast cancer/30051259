Here, we report the development andinitial validation.METHODS: The 29-item PRRS was developed from the thematic analysis of twointerview studies with cancer patients and caregivers. In the evaluation study,participants completed the PRRS alongside the Social Difficulties Inventory(SDI), the main criterion measure for concurrent validity, and the FunctionalAssessment of Cancer Therapy - General and WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF)for additional convergent validity data. Questionnaires were completed atbaseline, 7-days (PRRS only) and 2 months. Demographic data and patientcharacteristics were collected at baseline.RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-five patients with stage III/IV breast, lung orgynaecological cancer or melanoma completed the PRRS at least once. Five itemsperformed poorly and were removed from the scale. The final 16 core itemsselected comprised 3 dimensions: family well-being, responsibilities and sociallife, and financial well-being, identified in principal component analysis,accounting for 61.5% of total variance. Missing data (0.6%) and floor/ceilingeffects were low (0%/1.5%). Cronbach's alpha was 0.9 for the PRRS-16; 0.79-0.87for the subscales. PRRS showed good test-retest reliability (ICC-0.86),sensitivity to change and the predicted pattern of correlation with validationmeasures r = |0.65-0.77|. The standalone 7-item jobs and careers subscalerequires further validation.CONCLUSIONS: Initial evaluation shows that the PRRS is psychometrically robustwith potential to inform the evaluation of new treatments in clinical trials and real-world studies.DOI: 10.1007/s11136-018-1940-2 PMID: 30051259
