However, manually segmenting the ultrasound images, which is skill and experience dependent, would lead to a subjective diagnosis; in addition, it is time-consuming forradiologists to review hundreds of clinical images. Therefore, automaticsegmentation of breast ultrasound images into functional tissues has receivedattention in recent years, amidst the more numerous studies of detection andsegmentation of masses. In this paper, we propose to use convolutional neuralnetworks (CNNs) for segmenting breast ultrasound images into four major tissues: skin, fibroglandular tissue, mass, and fatty tissue, on three-dimensional (3D)breast ultrasound images. Quantitative metrics for evaluation of segmentationresults including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1measure, all reached over80%, which indicates that the method proposed has the capacity to distinguishfunctional tissues in breast ultrasound images. Another metric called the Jaccardsimilarity index (JSI) yields an 85.1% value, outperforming our previous studyusing the watershed algorithm with 74.54% JSI value. Thus, our proposed methodmight have the potential to provide the segmentations necessary to assist theclinical diagnosis of breast cancer and improve imaging in other modes in medicalultrasound.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
