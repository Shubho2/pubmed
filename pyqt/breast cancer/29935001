Treatment beams were gated using AlignRT byregistering the whole breast region-of-interest to the surface generated from thesimulation CT scan. AlignRT recorded (three-dimensional) 3D displacements and thebeam-on-state every 0.3 s. Means and standard deviations of the displacementsduring vDIBH for each fraction were used to calculate setup margins. Intra-DIBHstability and the intrafraction reproducibility were estimated from the mediansof the 5th to 95th percentile range of the translations in each breath-hold andfraction, respectively.RESULTS: A total of 7269 breath-holds were detected over 1305 fractions in which a median dose of 200 cGy was delivered. Each fraction was monitored for5.95 ± 2.44 min. Calculated setup margins were 4.8 mm (A/P), 4.9 mm (S/I), and6.4 mm (L/R). The intra-DIBH stability and the intrafraction reproducibility were≤0.7 mm and ≤2.2 mm, respectively. The isotropic margin according to SI (9.2 mm) was comparable to other institutions' calculations that relied on x-ray imagingand/or spirometry for patients with left-sided cancer (9.8-11.0 mm). Likewise,intra-DIBH variability and intrafraction reproducibility of breast surfacemeasured with SI agreed with spirometry-based positioning to within 1.2 and0.36 mm, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that intra-DIBH variability, intrafractionreproducibility, and setup margins are similar to those reported by peer studies who utilized spirometry-based positioning.© 2018 The Authors.
