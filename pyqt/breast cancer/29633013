Its prognostic and predictive impacts ontrastuzumab efficacy were demonstrated in breast cancer. However, its clinicalsignificance in gastric cancer is still unclear.METHODS: Twenty-eight HER2-positive gastric cancer patients who had gastrectomyprior to trastuzumab-based chemotherapy were consecutively enrolled. IntratumoralHER heterogeneity was evaluated using whole-tissue sections byimmunohistochemistry. When all tumor cells overexpressed HER2 protein, the tumor was defined as homogeneously HER2 (Homo-HER2)-positive group. The others weredefined as heterogeneously HER2 (Hetero-HER2)-positive group.RESULTS: There was no significant difference in clinicopathological featuresbetween the two groups. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overallsurvival (OS) in the Homo-HER2-positive group were significantly longer thanthose in the Hetero-HER2-positive group (PFS; 20.0 months [95% CI 17.8-22.2] vs. 6.0 months [95% CI 2.3-9.7]; HR 0.11; 95% CI 0.03-0.41; p < 0.001, OS; notreached vs. 14.0 months [95% CI 11.9-16.1]; HR 0.18; 95% CI 0.06-0.61;p = 0.003). In the multivariate analysis, these associations remained significantboth in PFS (HR 0.12; 95% CI 0.03-0.46, p = 0.002) and OS (HR 0.21; 95% CI0.06-0.72, p = 0.013). With respect to response rate, no statistical differencewas found between two groups. However, deeper tumor shrinkage was obtained in theHomo-HER2-positive group compared with the Hetero-HER2-positive group(p = 0.046).CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral HER2 heterogeneity may have robust clinical impact ontrastuzumab efficacy in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer. Thesefindings should be validated by larger independent cohorts and further molecular correlative analyses are warranted.DOI: 10.1007/s00535-018-1464-0 PMID: 29633013
