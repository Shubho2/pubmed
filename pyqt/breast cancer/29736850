Patientswith ER-positive/HER2-negative operable invasive ductal carcinoma andpreoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI were consecutively included between2005 and 2009. The parenchyma of the breast contralateral to known cancer wassegmented automatically on MRI and contralateral parenchymal enhancement (CPE)was calculated. CPE was split into tertiles and tested for association withinvasive disease-free survival (IDFS) and overall survival (OS). Propensity scoreanalysis with inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to adjust CPE forpatient and tumour characteristics as well as systemic therapy.RESULTS: Three hundred and two patients were included. The median age atdiagnosis was 48 years (interquartile range, 42-57). Median follow-up was 88months (interquartile range, 76-102); 15/302 (5%) patients died and 37/302 (13%) had a recurrence or died. In context of multivariable analysis, IPW-adjusted CPE was associated with IDFS [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.05-0.68, p = 0.004] and OS (HR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.00-0.83, p = 0.032).CONCLUSIONS: Contralateral parenchymal enhancement on pre-treatment dynamiccontrast-enhanced MRI as an independent biomarker of survival in patients withER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer has been upheld in this study. Thesefindings are a promising next step towards a practical and inexpensive test forrisk stratification of ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.KEY POINTS: • High parenchymal-enhancement in the disease-free contralateralbreast reproduces as biomarker for survival. • This is in patients withER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer from an independent cancer centre. • Thisis independent of patient and pathology parameters and systemic therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5470-7 PMID: 29736850
