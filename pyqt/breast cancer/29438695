Electronic address: mhung@mdanderson.org.Protein glycosylation provides proteomic diversity in regulating proteinlocalization, stability, and activity; it remains largely unknown whether thesugar moiety contributes to immunosuppression. In the study of immune receptorglycosylation, we showed that EGF induces programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) andreceptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) interaction, requiringβ-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (B3GNT3) expression in triple-negativebreast cancer. Downregulation of B3GNT3 enhances cytotoxic T cell-mediatedanti-tumor immunity. A monoclonal antibody targeting glycosylated PD-L1 (gPD-L1) blocks PD-L1/PD-1 interaction and promotes PD-L1 internalization and degradation.In addition to immune reactivation, drug-conjugated gPD-L1 antibody induces apotent cell-killing effect as well as a bystander-killing effect on adjacentcancer cells lacking PD-L1 expression without any detectable toxicity. Our worksuggests targeting protein glycosylation as a potential strategy to enhanceimmune checkpoint therapy.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.ccell.2018.01.009 PMCID: PMC5824730 [Available on 2019-02-12]PMID: 29438695
