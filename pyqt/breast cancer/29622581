Due to the lack ofvalidated target molecules, no targeted therapy for TNBC is approved. Tissuefactor (TF) is a common yet specific surface target receptor for cancer cells,tumor vascular endothelial cells, and cancer stem cells in several types of solidcancers, including breast cancer. Here, we report evidence supporting the ideathat TF is a surface target in TNBC. We used in vitro cancer lines and in vivotumor xenografts in mice, all with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, derived frompatients' tumors. We showed that TF is overexpressed on TNBC cells and tumorneovasculature in 50% to 85% of TNBC patients (n = 161) and in TNBC cellline-derived xenografts (CDX) and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from mice, butwas not detected in adjacent normal breast tissue. We then describe thedevelopment of a second-generation TF-targeting immunoconjugate (called L-ICON1, for lighter or light chain ICON) with improved efficacy and safety profilescompared with the original ICON. We showed that L-ICON1 kills TNBC cells in vitrovia antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and can be used to treat human and murine TNBC CDX as well as PDX in vivo in orthotopic mouse models. Thus, TFcould be a useful target for the development of immunotherapeutics for TNBCpatients, with or without BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.
