The goal of this study is to comparethe surgical site complication rate of OBCS with that of standard BCS.METHODS: A single institution chart review evaluated all patients undergoing BCS for treatment of breast cancer. Patients treated from January 2009 to December2010, prior to adoption of oncoplastic techniques, were identified as thestandard surgery (SS) group. Patients treated with OBCS from January 2013 to July2015 were identified as the oncoplastic surgery (OS) group. All surgical sitecomplications were recorded.RESULTS: Overall, 561 patients were evaluated. The SS group comprised 273patients compared with 288 patients in the OS group. Surgical site complications occurred in 49 patients (17.9%) in the SS group compared with 23 patients (8.0%) in the OS group (p < 0.001).DISCUSSION: Overall, BCS has a low rate of significant surgical sitecomplications. OBCS has a lower rate of surgical site complications compared tostandard BCS.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2018.06.014 PMID: 30049436
