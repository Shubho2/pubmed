However, the molecular mechanismsunderlying the association between these factors and breast cancer risk arepoorly understood. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine whetherobesity and reproductive history are associated with expression levels of twobreast cancer-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), namely ZFAS1 and SRA1 incancer-free breast tissues of women.METHODS: In the current research, 145 healthy women were recruited, and thequantitative expression levels of the two lncRNAs were determined through qPCRassay after gathering the mammoplasty breast tissue samples.RESULTS: It was found that women with body mass index (BMI)â‰¥30 kg/m2 and BMI25-29 kg/m2 show a low expression of ZFAS1 compared to the BMI<25 kg/m2 ( P=0.031and P=0.027, respectively). Then, the correlation analysis disclosed a negativecorrelation of ZFAS1 low expression with increasing BMI (r=-0.194, P=0.019).Interestingly, this analysis demonstrated a negative correlation between lowexpression of the ZFAS1 and high BMI in women with menarche age below 14 (r=-221;P=0.028). Lastly, it was also revealed that there was a negative association ofthe low expression level of ZFAS1 with increasing BMI in women through regressionmodels (B=-0.048, P=0.019).CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest interesting clues about the links betweenhigh BMI and the expression levels of ZFAS1 in non-diseased breasts that may helpus better understand the underlying mechanisms through which obesity contributes to breast carcinogenesis. However, such results need more validations in futureresearch.DOI: 10.1177/1724600818762258 PMID: 29690801
