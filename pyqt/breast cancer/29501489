The current study aims to investigate the possible role and mechanism ofrecombinant Apoptin (rApoptin), a potential anticancer candidate that minimallyimpacts normal cells, in the breast cancer cell proliferation and apoptosisin vitro and in vivo. We found that rApoptin could effectively inhibit theproliferation and apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro, which wasfurther confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. Apoptin partially inhibitedMCF-7 cell xenograft tumor development in vivo. Furthermore, we found via westernblot that rApoptin-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was associatedwith the phosphorylation of Nur77 (p-Nur77) and Akt (p-Akt). In addition,compared with the control groups, rApoptin-treated tissues showed significantlyhigher expression of Bax and Cyt c while Bcl-2 expression was decreased byrApoptin treatment. Together, our results are the first to demonstrate thatrApoptin was able to effectively induce breast cancer cell apoptosis bothin vitro and in vivo and that this activity could be regulated by thephosphorylation of Nur77 and Akt and the mitochondrial pathway. Our findingshighlight the potential application of rApoptin as a breast cancer treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
