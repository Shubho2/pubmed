However, mechanisms underlyingJAK/STAT signaling-mediated breast tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Here, we showed that GRAMD1B expression is upregulated on IL-6 but downregulated upontreatment with the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 in the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells.Notably, Gramd1b knockdown caused morphological changes of the cells,characterized by the formation of membrane ruffling and protrusions, implicating its role in cell migration. Consistently, GRAMD1B inhibition significantlyenhanced cell migration, with an increase in the levels of the Rho family ofGTPases. We also found that Gramd1b knockdown-mediated pro-migratory phenotype isassociated with JAK2/STAT3 and Akt activation, and that JAK2 or Akt inhibitionefficiently suppresses the phenotype. Interestingly, AG490 dose-dependentlyincreased p-Akt levels, and our epistasis analysis suggested that the effect ofJAK/STAT inhibition on p-Akt is via the regulation of GRAMD1B expression. Takentogether, our results suggest that GRAMD1B is a key signaling molecule thatfunctions to inhibit cell migration in breast cancer by negating both JAK/STATand Akt signaling, providing the foundation for its development as a novelbiomarker in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27864-6 PMCID: PMC6015000PMID: 29934528
