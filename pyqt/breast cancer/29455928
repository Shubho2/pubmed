However, how the Warburg effectis directly regulated is largely unknown. Here we show that transcription factor SIX1 directly increases the expression of many glycolytic genes, promoting theWarburg effect and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. SIX1 regulates glycolysisthrough HBO1 and AIB1 histone acetyltransferases. Cancer-related SIX1 mutationincreases its ability to promote aerobic glycolysis and tumor growth. SIX1glycolytic function is directly repressed by microRNA-548a-3p, which isdownregulated, inversely correlates with SIX1, and is a good predictor ofprognosis in breast cancer patients. Thus, the microRNA-548a-3p/SIX1 axisstrongly links aerobic glycolysis to carcinogenesis and may become a promisingcancer therapeutic target.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
