Comparing thecurrent exam to prior exams reduces the number of follow-up procedures requested by radiologists. Such comparison, however, can be challenging due to the highlydeformable nature of breast tissues. Automated co-registration of multiple scans has the potential to aid diagnosis by providing 3D images for side-by-sidecomparison and also for use in CAD systems. Although many deformable registrationtechniques exist, they generally have a large number of parameters that need tobe optimized and validated for each new application. Here, we propose a frameworkfor such optimization and also identify the optimal input parameter set forregistration of 3D T1-weighted MRI of breast using Elastix, a widely used andfreely available registration tool. A numerical simulation study was firstconducted to model the breast tissue and its deformation through finite element(FE) modeling. This model generated the ground truth for evaluating theregistration accuracy by providing the deformation of each voxel in the breastvolume. An exhaustive search was performed over various values of 7 registration parameters (4050 different combinations of parameters were assessed) and theoptimum parameter set was determined. This study showed that there was a largevariation in the registration accuracy of different parameter sets ranging from0.29 mm to 2.50 mm in median registration error and 3.71 mm to 8.90 mm in 95percentile of the registration error. Mean registration errors of 0.32 mm, 0.29mm, and 0.30 mm and 95 percentile errors of 3.71 mm, 5.02 mm, and 4.70 mm wereobtained by the three best parameter sets. The optimal parameter set was applied to consecutive breast MRI scans of 13 patients. A radiologist identified 113landmark pairs (~â€‰11 per patient) which were used to assess registrationaccuracy. The results demonstrated that using the optimal registration parameter set, a registration accuracy (in mm) of 3.4 [1.8 6.8] was achieved.DOI: 10.1007/s10278-018-0063-1 PMID: 29654424
