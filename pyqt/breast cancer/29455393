Rac1 and Cdc42 belong to the Rho family of genes that,together with their downstream effectors, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein-familyverprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) and Arp2/3, assume a vital part incytoskeletal rearrangement and the arrangement of film projections that advancemalignant cell relocation and invasion. Mangiferin is a characteristicpolyphenolic compound from Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae), ordinarilyreferred to as mango, that is consumed worldwide as a natural product, including culinary and seasoning applications. Mangiferin delays breast malignancydevelopment and progression by inhibiting different signalling pathways required in mitogenic signalling and metastatic progression. Studies were performed toanalyse the impact of mangiferin on Rac1/WAVE2 flagging, relocation and invasion in highly metastatic human MDA-MB-231 mammary cells. Additional studies led tothe observation that comparative treatment with mangiferin caused markedreduction in tumour cell movement and invasion. Taken together, these discoveriesdemonstrate that mangiferin treatment adequately hinders Rac1/WAVE2 flagging and diminishes metastatic phenotypic expression in malignant mammary cells,indicating that mangiferin may provide a benefit as a novel restorative approach in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10616-017-0140-1 PMCID: PMC5851954 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29455393
