Our JG-98 series of Hsp70 inhibitorsshow anti-cancer activities affecting both cancer cells and tumor-associatedmacrophages. They disrupt Hsp70 interaction with a co-chaperone Bag3 and affectsignaling pathways important for cancer development. Due to a prior report thatdepletion of Hsp70 causes similar responses as depletion of Hsp90, interest toHsp70 inhibitors as drug prototypes is hampered by potential similarity of their effects to effects of Hsp90 inhibitors. Here, using the Connectivity Map platformwe demonstrate that physiological effects of JG-98 are dissimilar from effects ofHsp90 inhibitors, thus justifying development of these compounds. Using geneexpression and ActivSignal IPAD platform, we identified pathways modulated byJG-98. Some of these pathways were affected by JG-98 in Bag3-dependent (e.g. ERK)and some in Bag3-independent manner (e.g. Akt or c-myc), indicating multipleeffects of Hsp70 inhibition. Further, we identified genes that modulate cellular responses to JG-98, developed approaches to predict potent combinations of JG-98 with known drugs, and demonstrated that inhibitors of proteasome, RNApol, Akt andRTK synergize with JG-98. Overall, here we established unique effects of novelHsp70 inhibitors on cancer cell physiology, and predicted potential drugcombinations for pre-clinical development.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-017-14900-0 PMCID: PMC5813176PMID: 29445088
