Our aim was to provide accurate population-based estimates of the health services cost of cancer care using large-scale linked patient-leveldata.METHODS: We analysed data for incident cancers diagnosed 2006-2010 and followedto 2014 among 266,793 eligible participants in the 45 and Up Study. Health systemcosts included Medicare and pharmaceutical claims, inpatient hospital episodesand emergency department presentations. Costs for cancer cases and matchedcancer-free controls were compared, to estimate monthly/annual excess costs ofcancer care by cancer type, before and after diagnosis and by phase of care(initial, continuing, terminal). Total costs incurred in 2013 were also estimatedfor all people diagnosed in Australia 2009-2013.RESULTS: 7624 participants diagnosed with cancer were matched with up to threecontrols. The mean excess cost of care per case was AUD$1,622 for the year beforediagnosis, $33,944 for the first year post-diagnosis and $8,796 for the secondyear post-diagnosis, with considerable variation by cancer type. Mean annual costafter the initial treatment phase was $4,474/case and the mean cost for the last year of life was $49,733/case. In 2013 the cost for cancers among people inAustralia diagnosed during 2009-2013 was ~$6.3billion (0.4% of Gross DomesticProduct; $272 per capita), with the largest costs for colorectal cancer($1.1billion), breast cancer ($0.8billion), lung cancer ($0.6billion) andprostate cancer ($0.5billion).CONCLUSIONS: The cost of cancer care is substantial and varies by cancer type andtime since diagnosis. These findings emphasise the economic importance ofeffective primary and secondary cancer prevention strategies.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0201552 PMID: 30059534
