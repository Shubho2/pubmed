Duncan Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030,USA.Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype withfeatures similar to the basal cells surrounding the mammary ducts. Treatment ofpatients with BLBC has been challenging due to the lack of well-defined moleculartargets. Due to the clinical and pathological similarities of BLBC withBRCA-deficient breast cancers, the effectiveness of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) has been tested in early phase clinical trials for patientswith advanced BLBC, with limited clinical responses. Recently, it was reportedthat HORMAD1 overexpression sensitizes BLBC to HR-targeting agents by suppressinghomologous recombination. Our independent analysis suggests that HORMAD1 isaberrantly overexpressed in about 80% of BLBC, and its expression in normaltissues is restricted to testis. Our experimental data suggests that HORMAD1overexpression correlates with focal hypomethylation in BLBC. On the other hand, investigation of the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer dataset revealedsignificantly reduced sensitivity of HORMAD1-overexpressing BLBC cell lines toRucaparib, a commonly used PARPi. To further assess the role of HORMAD1 in PARPi sensitivity, we generated three HORMAD1-overexpressing xenograft models using theHORMAD1-low BLBC cell lines HCC1954, HCC1806, and BT20; we then subjected thesexenograft models to Rucaparib treatment. Ectopic expression of HORMAD1 enhancestumor formations in two of these models, and significantly reduces sensitivity toRucaparib in the HCC1954 model. Taken together, our data suggest that epigenetic activation of HORMAD1 by hypomethylation in BLBC may endow reduced sensitivity toRucaparib treatment in some tumor models.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25728 PMCID: PMC6059019PMID: 30046392
