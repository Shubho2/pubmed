Gestational gigantomastia may be accompanied by hypercalcemia, whichin some cases has been associated with elevated serum levels of PTHrP. The sourceof the PTHrP in these cases has been suggested to be the enlarged breasts.Objective: To describe the rapid resolution of hypercalcemia and normalization ofserum PTHrP after elective termination of pregnancy, indicating that the placentawas the source of the PTHrP.Design: A retrospective analysis of clinical and biochemical data over a two-yearinterval and review of literature.Setting: An academic medical center.Patient: A 33-year-old G8P4 female who presented at week 8 of pregnancy withgestational gigantomastia and subsequently developed marked hypercalcemia at week13. Serum levels of PTH were suppressed but circulating PTHrP was elevated. Therewas no history of hypercalcemia or significant breast growth during previouspregnancies.Intervention: Hypercalcemia was poorly responsive to intravenous saline,prednisone, calcitonin and cinacalcet. She requested termination of pregnancy at week 20.Results: Serum levels of calcium, PTH and PTHrP normalized within 48 hours oftermination of pregnancy.Conclusion: The rapid resolution of hypercalcemia after termination of pregnancy,despite persistent gigantomastia, provides evidence for a pathologic role of the placenta in the excess production of PTHrP, possibly through an as yetuncharacterized placenta-breast hormonal axis.DOI: 10.1210/jc.2018-01181 PMID: 30032172
