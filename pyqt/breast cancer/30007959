[Epub ahead of print]Curious Residents of the Thyroid Gland: Two Case Reports of Colorectal Carcinoma Metastasis by Fine-Needle Aspiration Diagnosis.Melis C(1), Ballaux F(2), Bourgain C(1)(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, University Hospitals of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.(2)Department of Pathology, Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium.BACKGROUND: The most frequent metastases to the thyroid originate in the kidney, lung or breast. Colorectal adenocarcinoma represents less than 4% of metastasesto the thyroid gland. Solitary metastases of colorectal cancer with no othermanifestation of disseminated cancer disease are exceedingly rare. Within theBethesda Classification for Reporting -Thyroid Cytopathology, metastases areincluded in Diagnostic Categories "Suspicious for Malignancy" and "Malignant."CASES: We present 2 cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the thyroid gland, diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration (FNA). One metastasis occurred innormal thyroid parenchyma; the other was a tumour-to-tumour metastasis into afollicular carcinoma of the thyroid. The latter is the first publishedtumour-to-tumour metastasis of a colorectal carcinoma in the thyroid from whichboth components were diagnosed by FNA.CONCLUSION: Diagnosing a metastasis to the thyroid is challenging. On FNA, a dualcell population should raise suspicion. Immunocytochemical and molecular analysismay be helpful. Clinical information is essential in guiding specific ancillarytechnique panels in scant cellular material.Â© 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.DOI: 10.1159/000490367 PMID: 30007959
