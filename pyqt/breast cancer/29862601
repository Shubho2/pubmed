GM is microscopically characterizedby formation of epithelioid granulomas and abscess (suppurative granulomas) with lipid droplet-centered inflammation. Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii (Ck) is knownas a causative bacterium of GM, and identification of Ck infection within thelesion should thus be essential for confirming the diagnosis. In the presentstudy, we analyzed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy specimens of atotal of 18 GM lesions with immunostaining and real-time PCR for Ck genome.Widely cross-reactive rabbit antisera against Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG),Bacillus cereus, Treponema pallidum and Escherichia coli were chosen. Withreal-time PCR, Ck genome was demonstrated in 7 of 18 GM lesions.Immunohistochemically, the low-specificity antisera reacted with the cytoplasm ofphagocytes and/or granuloma-engulfed lipid droplets in 12 of 18 GM lesions.Antigenic positivity was observed in the following order: BCG > B. cereus > T.pallidum > E. coli. Real-time PCR using DNA extracted from FFPE sections wasuseful but not consistent for identifying the Ck genome in GM, whileimmunostaining using cross-reactive antisera against four kinds of bacteria wasnot Ck-specific but was applicable to visualizing bacterial infection within the GM lesions.Â© 2018 Japanese Society of Pathology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/pin.12683 PMID: 29862601
