The study used a descriptive cross-sectional design using the2017 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) data collected by theNational Cancer Institute. Adherence was defined based on the guidelines from theAmerican Cancer Society and the composite measure of shared decision-making wasconstructed using three items in the data. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the association between the SDM and adherence, controllingfor cancer beliefs and socio-demographic variables. The analysis included 742responses. Weighted to represent the U.S. population, 68.1% adhered to bothbreast and cervical cancer screening guidelines. The composite measure of SDM wasreliable (Î± = 0.85), and a higher SDM score was associated with women's screeningadherence (b = 0.17; p = 0.009). There were still women who did not receivecancer screenings as recommended. The results suggest that the use of the SDMapproach for healthcare professionals' communication with patients can improvescreening adherence.DOI: 10.3390/ijerph15071509 PMCID: PMC6068979PMID: 30018244
