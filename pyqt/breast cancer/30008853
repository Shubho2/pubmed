China.Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth most common malignancy in women,with a 5-year mortality of >70% in North America. As the symptoms are often notobserved until the cancer has spread extensively, few women are diagnosed at anearly stage of disease. Large-scale gene expression analyses have identifiedmolecular subtypes within high-grade ovarian cancer with variable survival rates and drug resistance. The understanding of gene expression, the mechanismsunderlying cancer processes and drug resistances have facilitated the developmentof targeted therapies. The far-upstream element (Fuse)-binding protein 1 (FBP1)is overexpressed in a number of malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma,and has been identified as an oncoprotein. In our early studies, FBP1 wasdemonstrated to physically interact with p53 and suppresses p53 transcriptionactivity. In the present study, FBP1 expression increased as ovarian cancerdeveloped. Among ovarian normal, adenoma and carcinoma tissues, the highest FBP1 expression was identified in carcinoma tissues. Furthermore FBP1 did notinfluence the apoptosis of ovarian carcinoma cells, yet enhanced cell cycletransition and metastasis. Therefore, it was hypothesized that FBP1 promotesovarian cancer development through the acceleration of cell cycle transition and metastasis, and FBP1 is a novel potential biological marker for epithelialovarian cancer diagnosis.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8872 PMCID: PMC6036457PMID: 30008853
