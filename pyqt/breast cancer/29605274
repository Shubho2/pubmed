Electronicaddress: ohdo@phar.kyushu-u.ac.jp.Proliferation of acute lymphoblastic leukemic cells is nutritionally dependent onthe external supply of asparagine. l-asparaginase, an enzyme hydrolyzingl-asparagine in blood, is used for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemic and other related blood cancers. Although previous studies demonstrated thatl-asparaginase suppresses the proliferation of cultured solid tumor cells, itremains unclear whether this enzyme prevents the growth of solid tumors in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated the importance of optimizing dosing schedules for the anti-tumor activity of l-asparaginase in 4T1 breast tumor-bearing mice.Cultures of several types of murine solid tumor cells were dependent on theexternal supply of asparagine. Among them, we selected murine 4T1 breast cancercells and implanted them into BALB/c female mice kept under standardizedlight/dark cycle conditions. The growth of 4T1 tumor cells implanted in mice was significantly suppressed by intravenous administration of l-asparaginase duringthe light phase, whereas its administration during the dark phase failed to show significant anti-tumor activity. Decreases in plasma asparagine levels due to theadministration of l-asparaginase were closely related to the dosingtime-dependency of its anti-tumor effects. These results suggest that theanti-tumor efficacy of l-asparaginase in breast tumor-bearing mice is improved byoptimizing the dosing schedule.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
