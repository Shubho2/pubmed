(Lock, Brackstone).SUMMARY: Studies have shown that a number of women do not receive adjuvantradiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery; the reasons have not been well investigated. We reviewed the charts of 267 patients in our institution who did not receive radiation therapy following surgery in order to determinepatient-stated reasons for nonreceipt. We found that 43% of patients did notreceive radiation because they received a completion mastectomy. Excluding these patients, reasons for nonreceipt of radiation therapy were sorted into 9categories. Most patients declined radiation therapy (against physician advice). We identified 3 major barriers to receipt of radiation therapy: improper patient selection, transportation or ambulatory issues and patient fear surroundingradiation toxicity. All of these reasons are surmountable barriers to radiationreceipt.PMCID: PMC5866151PMID: 29582751
