[Epub ahead of print]Mouse ER+/PIK3CAH1047R breast cancers caused by exogenous estrogen areheterogeneously dependent on estrogen and undergo BIM-dependent apoptosis withBH3 and PI3K agents.Stratikopoulos EE(1), Kiess N(1), Szabolcs M(2), Pegno S(1), Kakit C(1), Wu X(1),Poulikakos PI(1), Cheung P(1), Schmidt H(3), Parsons R(4).Author information: (1)Department of Oncological Sciences, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School ofMedicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.(2)Department of Pathology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY,10032, USA.(3)Department of Surgery, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine atMount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.(4)Department of Oncological Sciences, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School ofMedicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA. ramon.parsons@mssm.edu.Estrogen dependence is major driver of ER + breast cancer, which is associatedwith PI3K mutation. PI3K inhibition (PI3Ki) can restore dependence on ERsignaling for some hormone therapy-resistant ER + breast cancers, but isineffective in others. Here we show that short-term supplementation with estrogenstrongly enhanced Pik3caH1047R-induced mammary tumorigenesis in mice thatresulted exclusively in ER + tumors, demonstrating the cooperation of the hormoneand the oncogene in tumor development. Similar to human ER + breast cancers that are endocrine-dependent or endocrine-independent at diagnosis, tumor lines fromthis model retained ER expression but were sensitive or resistant to hormonaltherapies. PI3Ki did not induce cell death but did cause upregulation of thepro-apoptotic gene BIM. BH3 mimetics or PI3Ki were unable to restore hormonesensitivity in several resistant mouse and human tumor lines. Importantlyhowever, combination of PI3Ki and BH3 mimetics had a profound, BIM-dependentcytotoxic effect in PIK3CA-mutant cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Wepropose that addition of BH3 mimetics offers a therapeutic strategy to markedlyimprove the cytotoxic activity of PI3Ki in hormonal therapy-resistant andER-independent PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0436-4 PMID: 30076411
