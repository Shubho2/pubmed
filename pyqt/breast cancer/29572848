The aim of this experimental study is to assessits quantitative accuracy for potential clinical 99m Tc-sestamibi (MIBI)-related SPECT/CT application in neoadjuvant chemotherapy response studies in breastcancer.METHODS: Two phantoms were filled with MIBI and acquired on a SPECT/CT gammacamera (Discovery 670 Pro; GE Healthcare), that is, a water cylinder and a NEMAbody phantom containing six spheres that were filled with an activityconcentration reflecting clinical MIBI uptake. Subsequently, volumes-of-interest (VOI) of each sphere were drawn (semi)automatically on SPECT using variousisocontour methods or manually on CT. Finally, prone MIBI SPECT/CT scans wereacquired 5 and 90 min p.i. in a locally advanced breast cancer patient.RESULTS: Activity concentration in the four largest spheres converged after nine iterations of evolution. Depending on the count statistics, the accuracy of thereconstructed activity concentration varied between -4.7 and -0.16% (VOI coveringthe entire phantom) and from 6.9% to 10% (8.8 cm ⌀ cylinder VOI placed in thecenter of the phantom). Recovery coefficients of SUVmax were 1.89 ± 0.18, 1.76 ± 0.17, 2.00 ± 0.38, 1.89 ± 0.35, and 0.90 ± 0.26 for spheres with 37, 28, 22, 17, and 13 mm ⌀, respectively. Recovery coefficients of SUVmean were 1.07 ± 0.06,1.03 ± 0.09, 1.17 ± 0.21, 1.10 ± 0.20, and 0.52 ± 0.14 (42% isocontour); 1.10 ±0.07, 1.02 ± 0.09, 1.13 ± 0.19, 1.06 ± 0.19, and 0.51 ± 0.13 (36% isocontour withlocal background correction); and 0.96, 1.09, 1.03, 1.03, and 0.29 (CT). Patient study results were concordant with the phantom validation.CONCLUSIONS: Absolute SPECT/CT quantification of breast studies using MIBI seems feasible (<17% deviation) when a 42% isocontour is used for delineation fortumors of at least 17 mm diameter. However, with tumor shrinkage, responseevaluation should be handled with caution, especially when using SUVmax .© 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/mp.12880 PMID: 29572848
