However, accumulating data indicate that the current ELISA system for detecting CA15‑3, which targets thepeptide backbone of CA15‑3, is not sufficiently sensitive to detect early orlocalized breast cancer. In the present study, we designed an antibody‑lectinsandwich assay detecting glycosylation of CA15‑3 in patients with breast cancer. Ιmmobilized anti‑CA15‑3 monoclonal antibody captures CA15‑3 in serum, andglycosylation of the CA15‑3 is detected with Concanavalin A (ConA) lectin, which preferentially bind high‑mannose N‑glycans. ConA provided the best signal fordetecting serum CA15‑3 among 9 types of lectin, Since CA15‑3 is a heavilyglycosylated protein, detecting the glycosylation of CA15‑3 should be a much moresensitive way to assess CA15‑3 than the current ELISA method. Linear responseswere obtained in the anti‑CA15‑3 antibody‑ConA sandwich assay when sera werediluted up to 2000‑fold. This dilution factor is comparable with that of thecurrent ELISA system which allows 50‑ to 100‑fold serum dilutions. Theglycosylation level of CA15‑3 was found to increase with increasing breast cancerstage in the sandwich assay. The assay system appeared to efficientlydiscriminate breast cancer stage I (sensitivity: 63%, specificity: 69%), IIA(sensitivity: 77%, specificity: 75%), IIB (sensitivity: 69%, specificity: 86%)and III (sensitivity: 80%, specificity: 65%) from benign breast disease. Theantibody‑lectin sandwich assay shows promise as a new prospect for the earlydetection of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6433 PMCID: PMC6059737PMID: 29749490
