Our goal was to investigate the impact of these patches on drainage after axillarydissection for breast cancer.METHODS: In a phase III superiority trial, we randomized patients undergoingbreast-conserving surgery at 14 Swiss sites to receive versus not receive threelarge TachoSil® patches in the dissected axilla. Axillary drains were inserted inall patients. Patients and investigators assessing outcomes were blinded to groupassignment. The primary endpoint was total volume of drainage.RESULTS: Between March 2015 and December 2016, 142 patients were randomized (72with TachoSil® and 70 without). Mean total volume of drainage in the controlgroup was 703 ml [95% confidence interval (CI) 512-895 ml]. Application ofTachoSil® did not significantly reduce the total volume of axillary drainage[mean difference (MD) -110 ml, 95% CI -316 to 94, p = 0.30]. A total of eightsecondary endpoints related to drainage, morbidity, and quality of life were not improved by use of TachoSil®. The mean total cost per patient did not differsignificantly between the groups [34,253 Swiss Francs (95% CI 32,625-35,880) withTachoSil® and 33,365 Swiss Francs (95% CI 31,771-34,961) without, p = 0.584]. In the TachoSil® group, length of stay was longer (MD 1 day, 95% CI 0.3-1.7,p = 0.009), and improvement of pain was faster, although the latter differencewas not significant [2 days (95% CI 1-4) vs. 5.5 days (95% CI 2-11); p = 0.2].CONCLUSIONS: TachoSil® reduced drainage after axillary dissection for breastcancer neither significantly nor relevantly.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6556-9 PMID: 29948418
