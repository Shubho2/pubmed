We assessed the associationof social complexity factors with the quality of care patients received inprimary care settings.METHODS: Eleven social complexity factors were defined using administrative data on poverty, mental health, newcomer status, and justice system involvement fromthe Manitoba Population Research Data Repository. We measured the distribution ofthese factors among primary care patients who made at least 3 visits during2010-2013 to clinicians in Manitoba, Canada. Using generalized linear mixedmodeling, we measured 26 primary care indicators to compare the quality of carereceived by patients with 0 to 5 or more social complexity factors.RESULTS: Among 626,264 primary care patients, 54% were living with at least 1social complexity factor, and 4% were living with 5 or more. Social complexityfactors were strongly associated with poorer outcomes with respect to primarycare indicators for prevention (eg, breast cancer screening; odds ratio [OR] =0.77; 99% CI, 0.73-0.81), chronic disease management (eg, diabetes management; OR= 0.86; 99% CI, 0.79-0.92), geriatric care (eg, benzodiazepine prescriptions; OR = 1.63; 99% CI, 1.48-1.80), and use of health services (eg, ambulatory visits; OR= 1.09; 99% CI, 1.08-1.09).CONCLUSIONS: Linking health and social data demonstrates how social determinants are associated with primary care service provision. Our findings provide insight into the social needs of primary care populations, and may support thedevelopment of focused interventions to address social complexity in primarycare.Â© 2018 Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.DOI: 10.1370/afm.2236 PMCID: PMC5951250 [Available on 2018-11-01]PMID: 29760025
