Surgeon advice regardsurgical procedure is one of the most important factors in decision making. Ourstudy aims to compare the rate of breast-conserving surgery (BCS), mastectomy(MT) and mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (MTIBR) between thesurgeons who offer only MT (group A) and who offer BCS MT and MTIBR (group B).Method: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Ratchaburi hospital,Thailand from January 2010 to April 2014. We categorized patients into 2 groups(group A and B). Univariated analysis was selected to determine the factors that associated with the breast surgery procedures. Results: From January 2010 toApril 2014, we recruited 310 breast cancer patients, 221 patients (71.2%) weretreated by surgeons in group A, 89 patients (28.7%) by surgeons in group B. Thechoice of breast surgery is significantly different between 2 groups (P<0.001).In group A, 213 (96.3%) patient had MT and only 3 (1.3%) BCS and 5 (2.2%) MTIBR. Whilst in group B, 58 (65.1%) patient had MT and 11 (12.3%) BCS and 20(22.4%)MTIBR. Choice of breast surgery in patients with stage 1,2,3 are significantlydifferent between 2 groups (P=0.004, <0.001, 0.025 respectively). Age is the onlyfactor that significantly affects the choice of surgery in the group B but not ingroup A. Conclusion: Surgeon’s competency and comprehensive preoperativeconsultation by offering BCS, MT and MTIBR can affect the choice of surgicalprocedure for breast cancer patient.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.5.1189 PMCID: PMC6031837PMID: 29801400
