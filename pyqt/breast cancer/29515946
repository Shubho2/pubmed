First, the optimal conditions for high-content QD loading in MSCs were established. Then, QD uptake in breast cancer cells was assessedafter 24 h in a 3D co-culture with nanoengineered MSCs. We found that incubation of MSCs with QDs in a serum-free medium provided the best accumulation results.It was found that 24 h post-labelling QDs were eliminated from MSCs. Our results demonstrate that breast cancer cells efficiently uptake QDs that are releasedfrom nanoengineered MSCs in a 3D co-culture. Moreover, the uptake is considerablyenhanced in metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells compared with MCF7 primary breast cancer cells. Our findings suggest that nanoengineered MSCs could serve as a vehicle fortargeted drug delivery to metastatic cancer.DOI: 10.3762/bjnano.9.32 PMCID: PMC5815277PMID: 29515946
