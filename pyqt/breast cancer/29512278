[Epub ahead of print]Common germline haplotypes and genotypes identified in BRCA2 exon 11 of dogs withMammary Tumors and histopathological analyses.Maués T(1), El-Jaick KB(2), Costa FB(3), Araujo GEF(2), Soares MVG(2), MoreiraAS(4), Ferreira MLG(1), Ferreira AMR(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Veterinary Clinic, Faculty of Veterinary,Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, Brazil.(2)Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Universidade Federal do Estadodo Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.(3)Department of Animal Pathology, Veterinary School, Universidade Federal deMinas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.(4)Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratory of Functional Genomics and Bioinformatics,RPT01A DNA Sequencing Platforms, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.The canine BRCA2 is a tumor supressor gene which encodes the BRCA2 protein,involved in DNA repair through interaction with the RAD51 recombinase. Thisprocess is mediated by eigth BRC repeats that are encoded by BRCA2 exon 11. Twovariants corresponding to human mutations in human BRC3 repeat have been reportedin canine BRC3 repeat. In addition, other variants have also been described incanine BRCA2 exon 11. Considering the importance of polymorphisms in human BRCA2 to breast cancer development, this study aimed to investigate the frequency ofvariants in BRCA2 exon 11 in 48 blood and tissue DNA samples from bitches withcanine mammary tumors (CMT), as well as, to analyze tumor stage andhistopathological features. Seven Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) wereidentified, three of which were evaluated as possibily or probably deleteriousvariant. Interestingly, almost all the 22 mammary tumors (except one) whichpresented a clinical staging equal to or greater than III carried at least onemutant allele of these three variants. Besides that, no statistically significantcorrelation was observed between any of the reported SNPs in heterozygosis orhomozygosis and either dogs data (such as breed, age or disease stage) or mammarytumors histopathological characteristics. A total of 97.9% of bitches had one to three polymorphisms of the seven identified in this study, which suggests apossibly correlation between the canine BRCA2 exon 11 polymorphisms and mammarycarcinogenesis.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/vco.12389 PMID: 29512278
