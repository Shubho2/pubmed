Here we tested whether ARID1A IHC could reliably predict ARID1A mutations identified by next-generation sequencing. Three commercially available antibodies - EPR13501 (Abcam), D2A8U (Cell Signaling), and HPA005456 (Sigma) -were optimised for IHC using cell line models and human tissue, and screenedacross a cohort of 45 gynaecological tumours. IHC was scored independently bythree pathologists using an immunoreactive score. ARID1A mutation status wasassessed using two independent sequencing platforms and the concordance betweenARID1A mutation and protein expression was evaluated using Receiver OperatingCharacteristic statistics. Overall, 21 ARID1A mutations were identified in 14/43 assessable tumours (33%), the majority of which were predicted to be deleterious.Mutations were identified in 6/17 (35%) ovarian clear cell carcinomas, 5/8 (63%) ovarian endometrioid carcinomas, 2/5 (40%) endometrial carcinomas, and 1/7 (14%) carcinosarcomas. ROC analysis identified greater than 95% concordance betweenmutation status and IHC using a modified immunoreactive score for all threeantibodies allowing a definitive cut-point for ARID1A mutant status to becalculated. Comprehensive assessment of concordance of ARID1A IHC and mutationstatus identified EPR13501 as an optimal antibody, with 100% concordance between ARID1A mutation status and protein expression, across different gynaecologicalhistological subtypes. It delivered the best inter-rater agreement between allpathologists, as well as a clear cost-benefit advantage. This could allowpatients to be accurately stratified based on their ARID1A IHC status into early phase clinical trials.Â© 2018 The Authors The Journal of Pathology: Clinical Research published by ThePathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/cjp2.103 PMCID: PMC6065117PMID: 29659191
