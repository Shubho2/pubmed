[Epub ahead ofprint]The cytotoxic effects of propolis on breast cancer cells involve PI3K/Akt andERK1/2 pathways, mitochondrial membrane potential, and reactive oxygen speciesgeneration.Frión-Herrera Y(1), Díaz-García A(2), Ruiz-Fuentes J(3), Rodríguez-Sánchez H(3), Sforcin JM(4).Author information: (1)São Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Biosciences, Campus Botucatu,São Paulo, Brazil.(2)Laboratories of Biofarmaceuticals and Chemistries Productions (LABIOFAM),Havana, Cuba.(3)Tropical Medicine Institute Pedro Kouri, Havana, Cuba.(4)São Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Biosciences, Campus Botucatu,São Paulo, Brazil. sforcin@ibb.unesp.br.Propolis has been extensively used to improve health and prevent inflammatorydiseases. Different types of Cuban propolis (red, brown and yellow) have beendocumented. The purpose of this research was to investigate the cytotoxic effectsof Cuban red propolis (CP) on MDA MB-231 cell line, since breast cancer isconsidered one of the most common causes of mortality among women.Antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity of CP against MDA MB-231 cells weredetermined by the 3-[4,5-dimethylth-iazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide(MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Apoptosis/necrosis, involvement of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways, mitochondrial membrane potential and expression of genes were investigated. CP extract exhibited antiproliferative and cytotoxiceffects on MDA MB-231 cells, what may be probably related to PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways. A decreased expression of apoptosis-related genes (TP53, CASP3, BAX andP21) was seen, whereas the expressions of BCL-2, BCL-XL, NOXA and PUMA wereunaffected. CP extract induced mitochondrial dysfunction and LDH release, whatindicated cell necrosis associated with reactive oxygen species production anddecreased cell migration. Our findings provide a basis for future investigationof chemopreventive and/or therapeutic studies against apoptosis-resistant breast cancer, in animals and humans.DOI: 10.1007/s10787-018-0492-y PMID: 29748880
