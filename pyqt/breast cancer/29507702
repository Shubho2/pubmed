These included breast carcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, femalegenital tract malignancy, lung non-small cell lung cancer, neuroendocrine tumors,ovarian surface epithelial carcinomas, and urinary tract cancers. Molecularprofiles using mostly immunohistochemistry (IHC) and DNA sequencing for tumorsfrom 841 patients had been previously used to recommend treatments; somephysicians followed the suggestions completely while some did not. Thisinformation was assessed to find out if the outcome was better for the patientswhere their received drugs matched recommendations. The IHC biomarker for theprogesterone receptor and for the androgen receptor were found to be mostprognostic for survival overall. The IHC biomarkers for P-glycoprotein (PGP),tyrosine-protein kinase Met (cMET) and the DNA excision repair protein ERCC1 werealso shown to be significant predictors of outcome. Patients whose treatmentsmatched those predicted to be of benefit survived for an average of 512 days,compared to 468 days for those that did not (P = 0.0684). In the matchedtreatment group, 34% of patients were deceased at the completion of monitoring,whereas this was 47% in the unmatched group (P = 0.0001).DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24258 PMCID: PMC5823623PMID: 29507702
