A recentmeta-analysis with prospective evidences did not support the positive associationbetween IA and breast cancer risk. Thus, we in our meta-analysis study have triedto analyze this specific association.We searched all relevant articles from anEnglish-language literature using Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases, untilDecember 10, 2016. All the statistical analyses were performed on case-controlstudies, using Review Manager Software 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford,UK).Our meta-analysis results based on 25 studies, including 5 studies withChinese patients, indicated that there was no association of IA with breastcancer (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.98-1.19, P = .1). However, significant heterogeneity was observed, and thus further subgroup analyses were conducted. The combined OR of subjects with only 1-time IA was 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.18, P = .63, while forsubjects with 2 or more IAs, it was 1.06, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30, P = .58. Inaddition, the ORs of subjects, with 1st IA age either less than 30 or older than 30, were 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26, P = .59, and 1.18, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.49,P = .17, respectively. These observations indicated that number of IAs and theage of 1st IA were not associated with breast cancer risk. Due to lack ofdose-response relationships, it is difficult to say if number of IAs contributed into statistical heterogeneity. But after subgroup analysis, the age at the 1stIA appeared to impact the statistical heterogeneity. The different reproductivehistory appears to account for the high heterogeneity among individual studies.Also analysis of nulliparous women showed no significant difference in theassociation of IA and breast cancer (OR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.86-1.21, P = .85).However, parous women had higher IA rate in case group than control group(OR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.20, P = .01). Ethnicities might also result in highheterogeneity; thus, we conducted subgroup analyses on Chinese subjects,importantly, with 5 studies having Chinese patients, and did not observe anydifference in the incidence of IA and its association with breast cancer between case and control groups (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.13, P = .21).After subgroupanalysis, our study showed that IA might increase the risk of breast cancer inparous women, but in the nulliparous, IA was not significantly associated with anincreased risk of breast cancer.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.
