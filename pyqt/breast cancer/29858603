Activation of fibroblastgrowth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) was found to promote EMT and metastasis inprostate and breast cancers, but the effects and mechanisms in lung cancer wasunclear. In this study, we aimed to explore whether and how activation of FGFR1promotes EMT and metastasis in FGFR1-amplified lung cancer. We show thatactivation of FGFR1 by its ligand fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) promotedproliferation, EMT, migration, and invasion in FGFR1-amplified lung cancer celllines H1581 and DMS114, whereas inhibition of FGFR1 suppressed these processes.FGFR1 activation upregulated expression of Sry-related HMG box 2 (SOX2) bydownstream phosphorylated ERK1/2; moreover, the upregulation of SOX2 byautophosphorylation variant ERK2_R67S plasmid transfection was not suppressed by FGFR1 inhibitor AZD4547 or MEK/ERK inhibitor AZD6244 in vitro. And SOX2expression was also significantly upregulated in ERK2_R67S lentivirus-transfectedstable cell lines in vivo. Overexpression of SOX2 promoted cell proliferation,EMT, migration, and invasion. Importantly, activation of FGFR1 could not promote these processes in SOX2-silenced stable cell lines. In orthotopic andsubcutaneous lung cancer xenograft models, inhibition of FGFR1 suppressed tumorgrowth, SOX2 expression, EMT, and metastasis in vivo; however, these processescaused by SOX2-overexpressing stable cell lines were not suppressed by FGFR1inhibition. Higher expression of FGFR1 and SOX2 were positively correlated, andboth were associated with shorter survival in lung cancer patients. Inconclusion, our findings reveal that activation of FGFR1 promotes cellproliferation, EMT, and metastasis by the newly defined FGFR1-ERK1/2-SOX2 axis inFGFR1-amplified lung cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0311-3 PMID: 29858603
