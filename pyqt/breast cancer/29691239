We aimed to investigate apotential role of UGT2B10 in N-glucosidation and to determine the transportersfor the excretion of N-glucosides. We first established a human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK293) that stably overexpressed UGT2B10. Incubation of mianserinor cyclizine with the cells generated one N-glucuronide and one N-glucoside.Chemical inhibition (using specific chemical inhibitor Ko143) and biologicinhibition [using specific short hairpin RNA of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)] resulted in a significant reduction in efflux of N-glucuronide. Similarresults were observed when multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP4) wasinhibited. Furthermore, inhibition of BCRP led to increased intracellularN-glucoside, whereas inhibition of MRP4 caused no changes in disposition ofN-glucoside. Overall, the data indicated that BCRP, not MRP4, was responsible forthe excretion of N-glucosides, whereas both BCRP and MRP4 contributed toexcretion of N-glucuronides. Interestingly, downregulation of N-glucuronidationled to increased N-glucosidation in the cells, supporting the glucosidation as a potential complementary pathway for conventional glucuronidation. In conclusion, UGT2B10 was for the first time identified as an N-glucosidation enzyme. GeneratedN-glucosides were excreted primarily by the BCRP transporter.Copyright Â© 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/dmd.118.080804 PMID: 29691239
