This paucity of data has led to most of ourtreatment guidance being extrapolated from patients with female breast cancer(FBC). From 1998 to 2012, data were captured using the National Cancer Databaseto identify patients with nonmetastatic MBC (n = 23 305) and FBC (n = 2 678 061).Tumor and clinicopathologic features were obtained and compared. Patients withMBC were more likely to have invasive disease, T2-4 tumors, centrally locatedtumors, positive lymph nodes, estrogen receptor-positive or progesteronereceptor-positive tumors, lymphovascular space invasion, and were less likely to have Her2/neu-positive or triple-negative tumors. All of these differences werestatistically significant (P < .001). Treatment comparisons showed that patients with MBC were more likely to undergo mastectomy and less likely to undergobreast-conserving surgery with postoperative radiation utilization found to beless in patients with MBC, both as part of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) andfor postmastectomy radiation treatment (PMRT) (P < .001). Stage-by-stagecomparisons showed that median survival, 5-year, and 10-year overall survival(OS) rates are lower in patients with MBC vs patients with FBC (P < .001). Theutilization of adjuvant radiation, both BCT and PMRT, was shown to improve 5- and10-year OS (P < .001). Male breast cancer clinicopathologic features appear to beunfavorable in relation to FBC and adjuvant radiation is shown beneficial insurvival outcomes. Further investigation is needed to help guide futureutilization and treatment with radiation, systemic, and endocrine manipulation inthis small population of patients with MBC.DOI: 10.1177/1178223418770687 PMCID: PMC5987905PMID: 29881286
