Although effective, anthracyclinesuse can be limited by serious side effects and eventually the development of drugresistance. In S. cerevisiae, mutants of HOM6 display hypersensitivity todoxorubicin. HOM6 is required for synthesis of threonine and interruption of the pathway leads to accumulation of the threonine intermediateL-aspartate-semialdehyde. This intermediate may synergize with doxorubicin tokill the cell. In fact, deleting HOM3 in the first step, preventing the pathwayto reach the HOM6 step, rescues the sensitivity of the hom6 strain todoxorubicin. Using several S. cerevisiae strains (wild type, hom6, hom3,hom3hom6, ydj1, siz1, and msh2), we determined their sensitivity to aldehydes andto their combination with doxorubicin, cisplatin, and etoposide. Combination offormaldehyde and doxorubicin was most effective at reducing cell survival by31-fold-39-fold (in wild type cells) relative to doxorubicin and formaldehydealone. This effect was dose dependent on doxorubicin. Cotreatment withformaldehyde and doxorubicin also showed increased toxicity inanthracycline-resistant strains siz1 and msh2. The hom6 mutant also showedsensitivity to menadione with a 2.5-fold reduction in cell survival. Thepotential use of a combination of aldehydes and cytotoxic drugs could potentiallylead to applications intended to enhance anthracycline-based therapy.DOI: 10.1155/2018/4938189 PMCID: PMC5998155PMID: 30003101
