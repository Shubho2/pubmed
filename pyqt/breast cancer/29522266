In this study, 5589 consecutiveBC index patients negative for pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations and 2189 femalecontrols were screened for germ line mutations in eight cancer predispositiongenes (ATM, CDH1, CHEK2, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, and TP53). All patients met the inclusion criteria of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and OvarianCancer for germ line testing. The highest mutation prevalence was observed in theCHEK2 gene (2.5%), followed by ATM (1.5%) and PALB2 (1.2%). The mutationprevalence in each of the remaining genes was 0.3% or lower. Using ExomeAggregation Consortium control data, we confirm significant associations ofheterozygous germ line mutations with BC for ATM (OR: 3.63, 95%CI: 2.67-4.94),CDH1 (OR: 17.04, 95%CI: 3.54-82), CHEK2 (OR: 2.93, 95%CI: 2.29-3.75), PALB2 (OR: 9.53, 95%CI: 6.25-14.51), and TP53 (OR: 7.30, 95%CI: 1.22-43.68). NBN germ linemutations were not significantly associated with BC risk (OR:1.39, 95%CI:0.73-2.64). Due to their low mutation prevalence, the RAD51C and RAD51D genesrequire further investigation. Compared with control datasets, predicted damagingrare missense variants were significantly more prevalent in CHEK2 and TP53 in BC index patients. Compared with the overall sample, only TP53 mutation carriersshow a significantly younger age at first BC diagnosis. We demonstrate asignificant association of deleterious variants in the CHEK2, PALB2, and TP53genes with bilateral BC. Both, ATM and CHEK2, were negatively associated withtriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumorphenotypes. A particularly high CHEK2 mutation prevalence (5.2%) was observed in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive tumors.© 2018 The Authors.
