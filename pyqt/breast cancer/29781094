Our goal was to develop a new predictivemodel for SLN-positive patients after NAT, and validate this new model. A series of 513 patients with metastases in SLN who received NAT were used to evaluatefactors affecting NSLN status. Logistic regression analysis was performed todevelop a predictive model, which was validated by a subsequent prospective 138patients. There were 115 (22.4%) patients with metastases in NSLN followed byaxillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Multivariate analysis indicated that tumor(T) stage, number of positive SLN,micrometastases, extracapsular extension (ECE),and clinical response of primary tumor after NAT were significant independentpredictors for the NSLN metastases. Area under the curve (AUC) of the model was0.795 (95% CI, 0.734-0.861). When applied to the prospective series, the modelaccurately predicted the risk of NSLN disease, AUC was 0.772 (95% CI,0.653-0.845). We present a new predictive model to assess the risk of NSLN statusin Chinese SLN-positive breast cancer patients after NAT. The predictive modelperformed well in prospective validation but needs to be further studied inexternal center patients before application to clinical use.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13065 PMID: 29781094
