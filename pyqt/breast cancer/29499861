Mean age was 47. A pathogenicmutation or a VUS in BRCA1/2 was detected in 85 (77%) and 25 (23%) patients,respectively. The rate of risk reducing mastectomy (RRM) was 50% in women with a pathogenic mutation and 30% in women with a VUS (P = 0.232). Among women withbreast cancer, 65% with a pathogenic mutation and 40% with a VUS underwent RRM.Over 50% of women with a pathogenic mutation in BRCA1/2 chose surveillance overoperation.DISCUSSION: There was no statistical difference in the rate of RRM among womenwith a pathogenic mutation or a VUS in BRCA1/2 in our population. The majority ofhigh risk women in our study chose to forgo RRM for breast cancer screening.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2018.02.010 PMID: 29499861
