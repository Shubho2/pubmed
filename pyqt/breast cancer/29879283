Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)expression is an independent predictor of low overall survival in patients withIBC.Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the anti-EGFR antibodypanitumumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with primary humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative IBC.Design, Setting, and Participants: Women with primary HER2-negative IBC wereenrolled from 2010 to 2015 and received panitumumab plus neoadjuvantchemotherapy. Median follow-up time was 19.3 months. Tumor tissues collectedbefore and after the first dose of panitumumab were subjected toimmunohistochemical staining and RNA sequencing analysis to identify biomarkerspredictive of pCR.Intervention: Patients received 1 dose of panitumumab (2.5 mg/kg) followed by 4cycles of panitumumab (2.5 mg/kg), nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2), and carboplatinweekly and then 4 cycles of fluorouracil (500 mg/m2), epirubicin (100 mg/m2), andcyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) every 3 weeks.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was pCR rate; the secondary endpoint was safety. The exploratory objective was to identify biomarkers predictiveof pCR.Results: Forty-seven patients were accrued; 7 were ineligible. The 40 enrolledwomen had a median age of 57 (range, 23-68) years; 29 (72%) were postmenopausal. Three patients did not complete therapy because of toxic effects (n = 2) ordistant metastasis (n = 1). Nineteen patients had triple-negative and 21 hadhormone receptor-positive IBC. The pCR and pCR rates were overall, 11 of 40 (28%;95% CI, 15%-44%); triple-negative IBC, 8 of 19 (42%; 95% CI, 20%-66%); andhormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative IBC, 3 of 21 (14%; 95% CI, 3%-36%).During treatment with panitumumab, nab-paclitaxel, and carboplatin, 10 patientswere hospitalized for treatment-related toxic effects, including 5 withneutropenia-related events. There were no treatment-related deaths. The mostfrequent nonhematologic adverse event was skin rash. Several potential predictorsof pCR were identified, including pEGFR expression and COX-2 expression.Conclusions and Relevance: This combination of panitumumab and chemotherapyshowed the highest pCR rate ever reported in triple-negative IBC. A randomizedphase 2 study is ongoing to determine the role of panitumumab in patients withtriple-negative IBC and to further validate predictive biomarkers.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01036087.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.1436 PMID: 29879283
