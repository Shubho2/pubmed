We perform thiscomprehensive meta-analysis to figure out whether high dietary inflammatory index(DII) score is a risk factor for the occurrence of breast cancer.METHODS: We comprehensively searched the PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases toidentify included studies updated to September 12, 2017. All studies thatreported risk estimates by comparing the highest DII score to the lowest wereassessed.RESULTS: A total of seven observational studies were identified: three casecontrols and four cohorts, involving 319,993 participants. Overall, themeta-analysis reported that individuals with the highest DII score wereassociated with a 25% increased risk of breast cancer versus those with thelowest DII score (relative risk [RR] = 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]1.09-1.44; I2 = 82.7%, p = 0.000). Upon stratified analysis, significant positiveassociations remained for postmenopausal women (RR = 1.15; 95% CI 1.02-1.30;p = 0.020), case-control studies (RR = 1.68; 95% CI 1.13-2.49; p = 0.010), Asia(RR = 2.30; 95% CI 1.7-3.12; p = 0.0031) and Europe (RR = 1.26; 95% CI 1.01-1.58;p = 0.0477). When analysed on hormonal receptor status, 36% increased risk wasexplored for hormone-receptor negative.CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggested that more pro-inflammatory diets (higherDII scores) are associated with increased breast cancer incidence. However, theresearch is not about significant associations but about moderate effect sizes.DOI: 10.1038/s41430-018-0196-9 PMID: 29802296
