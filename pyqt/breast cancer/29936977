We sought to investigate the management and survival of women with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) from geographic regionswith variable rates of diagnosis.METHODS: Data on women diagnosed with IDC years 2009-2010 were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Patients were divided into quartiles based on the IDC diagnostic rate within their county of residence.Chi-square and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses tested theassociation between patient and clinical characteristics and the diagnostic rate quartiles. Cox regression analyses compared survival between the quartiles.RESULTS: Among the 83,375 patients included, the mean age was 60.8 y and 70.9%were white. Patients residing in counties with the highest diagnostic rates were more frequently white, employed, educated, and wealthier and more often received adjuvant radiation following both partial mastectomy for localized disease andcomplete mastectomy for advanced disease compared to patients in counties withthe lowest diagnostic rates. The highest diagnostic rate quartile had 10%decreased odds of death compared to the lower quartile (hazard ratio: 0.897; 95% confidence interval: 0.832-0.966). However, after adjustment for socioeconomicvariables, survival was comparable (hazard ratio: 0.916; 95% confidence interval:0.835-1.003).CONCLUSIONS: Regional variation in IDC diagnostic rates is associated withdifferences in socioeconomic status, grade, stage, and treatment. Patients fromregions with the highest rates of diagnosis may have improved access toevidence-based care and resultant superior survival. Enhancing access to care mayimprove outcomes of patients residing in regions where breast cancer is diagnosedless frequently.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
