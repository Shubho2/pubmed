It is reported to existin two polymorphic forms, a stable form I and a metastable form II. Both of theforms belong to the triclinic P-1 space group. In this work, we report thecrystallization of Gefitinib to form a methanol solvate [systematic name:N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-7-methoxy-6-[3-(morpholin-4-yl)propoxy]quinazolin-4-amine methanol hemisolvate, C22H24ClFN4O3·0.5CH3OH] that was theoretically andexperimentally investigated. The unit cell is composed of two independentGefitinib molecules (A and B) that form a stable molecular complex with methanol in the crystal lattice. To understand the crystal lattice stabilization, acombination of techniques, namely X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy,thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), Hirshfeld surfaceanalysis and CLP-PIXEL methods were used. The analysis of the crystal structureof this dimer revealed a three-dimensional isostructurality with the alreadyreported form II. The A and B molecules are connected via trifurcated C-H...O andN-H...O hydrogen bonding. In addition, the presence of the methanol moleculestabilizes the crystal structure via C-H...O, N-H...O and C-H...Cl interactionsbetween the two monomers. The IR analysis of the dimer has shown characteristicfingerprint values when compared to the commercial form. The TG-DSC analysis ofthe solvated dimer is in good agreement with the patent reporting cocrystals ofGefitinib. Finally, theoretical calculations by the CLP-PIXEL method andHirshfeld surface and two-dimensional (2D) fingerprint plot analysis were carriedout in order to quantify the different intermolecular interactions and theirenergies in the crystal packing.DOI: 10.1107/S2053229618009671 PMID: 30080170
