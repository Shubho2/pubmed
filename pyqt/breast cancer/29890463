The role of HPV in breast carcinogenesis has been a matter of debate fueled by conflicting reports in recent years. The aim of this study is toidentify the prevalence of breast and cervical HPV infection in cancer patientsby using a modern microarray approach.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present prospective study, 201 breast cancerpatients were included. For each patient a detailed medical history was taken andduring the operation, under sterile conditions, samples were collected, from the tumour, the healthy adjacent breast tissue and any positive sentinel lymph nodes.In addition, for each patient a cervical sample was also collected. All sampleswere analysed for DNA of 24 types of HPV using a microarray technique.RESULTS: Despite the high sensitivity of the technique used, no HPV DNA wasidentified in any of the breast or lymph node samples. Our analysis showed thatpatients with HPV positive cervical samples (28 cases) were more likely to havetumors with positive progesterone receptors (p=0.041) and were also more likelyto have two or three positive lymph nodes (p=0.002).CONCLUSION: In the present study, a combination of careful sample collection and a very sensitive microarray approach showed no correlation between HPV and breastcancer. However some characteristics of the breast tumors were different amongpatients with HPV DNA in their cervical samples.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
