We retrospectively identified all lesions that underwentultrasound-guided sampling of a presumed sonographic correlate and for which asubsequent postprocedural limited-sequence unenhanced MR image for cliplocalization was available. This consisted of a T1-weighted non-fat-saturated anda T2-weighted fat-saturated sequence. Frequencies of sonographic-MRI correlation were quantified.RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 35 patients with 38 presumed correlatesthat underwent ultrasound-guided sampling with postprocedural MRI for clipverification. The mean time from percutaneous sampling to postprocedural MRIexamination was 1 day. Ten presumed sonographic correlates (26%) were found tolocalize to a site distinct from the lesion originally identified on MRI. One of these discordant cases revealed malignancy on subsequent MRI-guided biopsy,whereas the presumed sonographic correlate was found to be benign. No patient or lesion characteristics were associated with significantly different frequenciesof correlation.CONCLUSION: In our initial experiences with MRI performed for postprocedural clipverification, 26% of presumed correlates to suspicious lesions detected on MRIwere not the actual correlate, and 10% of these discordant cases ultimatelyrevealed malignancy. Radiologists should take caution presuming that lesionsidentified on ultrasound actually represent the suspicious lesions detected onMRI. MRI for clip verification may be useful if ultrasound-guided sampling ispursued.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.17.18489 PMID: 29489404
