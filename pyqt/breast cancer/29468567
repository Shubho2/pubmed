[Epubahead of print]The Role of Optimism, Social Constraints, Coping, and Cognitive Processing inPsychosocial Adjustment Among Breast Cancer Survivors.Kolokotroni P(1), Anagnostopoulos F(2), Hantzi A(2).Author information: (1)Psychology Department, Panteion University of Social & Political Sciences, 136Syngrou Avenue, 176 71, Athens, Greece. philippa_ph04@yahoo.com.(2)Psychology Department, Panteion University of Social & Political Sciences, 136Syngrou Avenue, 176 71, Athens, Greece.The social-cognitive processing model suggests that a socially constrainedenvironment may impede adjustment to a chronic illness. The present studyprimarily investigated the mediating psychological pathways through which social constraints on cancer-related disclosure, low optimism, disengagement-orientedcoping, and brooding could be associated with low levels of psychosocialadjustment. One hundred twenty-five female breast cancer survivors participatedin a cross-sectional study. Path analysis was used to examine the proposed model.Low optimism, increased social constraints, and higher levels of broodingappeared to be risk factors for poor psychosocial adjustment to breast cancer.Disengagement-oriented coping and brooding partially mediated the relationshipbetween social constraints and adjustment. Brooding totally mediated therelationship between disengagement-oriented coping and adjustment. The currentfindings provide support for the value of the social-cognitive processing modelamong breast cancer survivors. The mapping of psychological pathways ofadjustment to breast cancer may have useful clinical implications for betteradjustment outcomes.DOI: 10.1007/s10880-018-9555-x PMID: 29468567
