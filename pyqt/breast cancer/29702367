This family comprises ofEGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2, HER2/neu), HER3 (ErbB3), and HER4 (ErbB4). Amongstthem, HER2 is associated with breast cancer and is one of the most valuabletargets in addressing the breast cancer incidences. For the currentinvestigation, we have performed 3D-QSAR based pharmacophore search for theidentification of potential inhibitors against the kinase domain of HER2 protein.Correspondingly, a pharmacophore model, Hypo1, with four features was generatedand was validated employing Fischer's randomization, test set method and thedecoy test method. The validated pharmacophore was allowed to screen the colossalnatural compounds database (UNPD). Subsequently, the identified 33 compounds weredocked into the proteins active site along with the reference after subjectingthem to ADMET and Lipinski's Rule of Five (RoF) employing the CDOCKER implementedon the Discovery Studio. The compounds that have displayed higher dock scoresthan the reference compound were scrutinized for interactions with the keyresidues and were escalated to MD simulations. Additionally, molecular dynamicssimulations performed by GROMACS have rendered stable root mean square deviation values, radius of gyration and potential energy values. Eventually, based uponthe molecular dock score, interactions between the ligands and the active siteresidues and the stable MD results, the number of Hits was culled to twoidentifying Hit1 and Hit2 has potential leads against HER2 breast cancers.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
