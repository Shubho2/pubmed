China.Adjuvant radiotherapy is an important clinical treatment option for patients withbreast cancer. However, for Caucasian patients, the clinical benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy can differ from African‑American patients with respect to theoverall survival. The goal of the current study was to develop a gene signatureand to pre‑identify patients likely to benefit from radiotherapy. Using publicly available breast cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, a new cross‑validationprocedure was proposed for developing a gene signature and predictingradiosensitive patients. The results demonstrated that the predictedradiosensitive patients who received radiotherapy exhibited a significantlybetter survival, while the effect of radiotherapy was not significant forpredicted non‑radiosensitive patients. Further hierarchical cluster analysisrevealed that the predicted sensitivity for each patient corresponded closely to the results of the cluster analysis. Collectively, the findings of the currentstudy demonstrated that a radiosensitive molecular signature can be used toidentify radiosensitive Caucasian patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6567 PMID: 30015959
