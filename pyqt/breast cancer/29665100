Two radiologistsretrospectively reviewed US images in consensus for background parenchymalechotexture interpretation. The maximum tumor diameter from static images wasrecorded. Tumor size measurements were considered as having agreement withhistologic results if they were within ±5 mm compared to the pathologic size. Therelationship between the accuracy of tumor size measurement by the backgroundparenchymal echotexture and clinicopathologic characteristics was evaluated.RESULTS: Of these 140 patients, 77 (55.0%) showed a homogeneous backgroundparenchymal echotexture, whereas 63 (45.0%) showed a heterogeneous echotexture.The mean tumor size was 1.9 cm (range, 0.5-4.9 cm). The overall accuracy of tumorsize measurement was 76.4% (104 of 140). Tumors of women with a homogeneousbackground parenchymal echotexture were more accurately measured than those ofwomen with a heterogeneous echotexture (87.0% versus 63.5%; P = .001). Tumorswith a small size (<2 cm; P = .018) and ductal carcinoma in situ-negative(P = .031), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (P = .053), and triple-negative (P = .016) types were also more accurately measured. Theindependent factors associated with inaccurate tumor size measurement were aheterogeneous background parenchymal echotexture, a large tumor size, and theHER2-enriched type (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: The background parenchymal echotexture affected the accuracy oftumor size estimation using breast US. Invasive breast cancers with large (≥2 cm)tumors and the HER2-enriched type showed significantly lower breast US accuracycompared to others.© 2018 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/jum.14622 PMID: 29665100
