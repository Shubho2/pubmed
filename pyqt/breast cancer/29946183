[Epub ahead of print]Genomic profiling of metaplastic breast carcinomas reveals genetic heterogeneity and relationship to ductal carcinoma.Krings G(1), Chen YY(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, University of California San Francisco (UCSF), SanFrancisco, CA, USA. gregor.krings@ucsf.edu.(2)Department of Pathology, University of California San Francisco (UCSF), SanFrancisco, CA, USA.Metaplastic breast carcinomas comprise a histologically heterogenous group oftumors. Although most are triple (estrogen/progesterone receptor, HER2) negative,these rare tumors are clinicopathologically distinct from other triple negativecarcinomas and may be aggressive with worse chemotherapy responses. On the other hand, metaplastic carcinomas are histologically diverse, which is reflected ingene expression differences among subtypes. Whether metaplastic carcinomas aregenetically distinct from other triple negative cancers and whether geneticdifferences underlie histologic subtypes remains poorly understood. We sequenced 408 cancer-related genes in 28 metaplastic carcinomas, including chondroidmatrix-producing carcinomas (n = 10), spindle cell carcinomas (n = 5), andcarcinomas with squamous (n = 5), mixed spindle/squamous (n = 5), and mixedmetaplastic (n = 3) differentiation. Metaplastic carcinomas were highly enriched for PIK3CA/PIK3R1 (61%) and Ras-Map kinase (25%) pathway aberrations compared to other triple negative carcinomas (TCGA dataset 14%, p < 0.001 and 7%, p = 0.005, respectively) and harbored a high frequency of TP53 (64%) and TERT promoter (25%)mutations, but this varied among subtypes. Chondroid-matrix producing carcinomas lacked PI-3 kinase and Ras-Map kinase aberrations and TERT promoter mutations,compared to 100%, 39%, and 39% of non-matrix-producing tumors, respectively. TERTpromoter mutations were enriched (47%) in spindle cell carcinomas and tumors withsquamous or spindle/squamous differentiation. Spindle cell carcinomas lacked TP53mutations, in contrast to other subtypes (78%, p = 0.003). Separate analysis ofpaired ductal carcinoma in situ and metaplastic carcinoma revealed sharedclonality in all cases (n = 8). Activating PI-3 kinase and Ras pathway mutations were early events, and inactivating mutations in tumor suppressors including RB1,CDKN2A, and TP53 were associated with invasion in individual cases. Metaplasticcomponents of two tumors showed genetic progression from separately sequencedpaired invasive ductal carcinoma. The findings suggest that metaplasticcarcinomas are genetically distinct from other triple negative breast cancers andhighlight genetic heterogeneity that broadly correlates with histologic subtype. Heterologous elements progress from associated ductal carcinoma.DOI: 10.1038/s41379-018-0081-z PMID: 29946183
