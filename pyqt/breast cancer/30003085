Noncoding RNA, such as microRNA (miR), have very influential roles in thetranscriptional regulation of genes. Transcriptional regulation can besuccessfully modeled and analyzed using complex network theory. Particularly,interactions between two distinct classes of biological elements, such as miR andgenes, can be approached through the bipartite network formalism. Based onbipartite network properties, it is possible to identify highly influential miRs in the network, such as those that have a large number of connections indicating regulation of a large set of genes. Some miRs in a network are nonredundant,which indicates that they are solely responsible of the regulation of aparticular set of genes, which in turn may be associated to a particularbiological process. We hypothesize that highly influential, nonredundant miRs,which we call Commodore miRs (Cdre-miRs), have an important role on the controlof biological functions through transcriptional networks. In this work, weanalyze the regulation of gene expression by miRs in healthy and cancerous breasttissue using bipartite miR-gene networks inferred from the Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA) expression data. We observe differences in the degree, clusteringcoefficient and redundancy distributions for miRs and genes in the network,indicating differences in the way that these elements interact with each other.Furthermore, we identify a small set of five Cdre-miRs in the breast cancernetwork: miR-190b, miR-let7i, miR-292-b, miR-511, and miR-141. The neighborhoodof genes controlled by each of these miRs is involved in particular biologicalfunctions such as dynein structure-associated processes, immune response,angiogenesis, cytokine activity, and cell motility. We propose that theseCdre-miRs are important control elements of biological functions deregulated inbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1155/2018/9585383 PMCID: PMC5996465PMID: 30003085
