84. Politics Life Sci. 2018 Spring;37(1):135-140. doi: 10.1017/pls.2018.3.Breast cancer screening.Vanderburgh D.Cass R. Sunstein's 2016 book The Ethics of Influence: Government in the Age ofBehavioral Science provides an extremely informative introduction to the science and ethics of the exercise of "influence" over others. As a longtime physicianemployed in both the public and private sectors, I now recognize that most of my formal training has been in the hard sciences, with little, if any, training inthe appropriate influence of the decision-making processes of my patients and/or other health care professionals in institutional settings. Breast cancerscreening is an excellent example of the conflicts of modern medicine,highlighting our collective inability to effectively "nudge" others in thepursuit of health and/or organizational effectiveness and efficiency. Using theframework of Sunstein's ethical values of welfare, autonomy, dignity, andself-government, I discuss many of the conflicting issues in a nationwide breast cancer screening program and the effects of these issues on client nudging todetermine whether mammography screening is ethical.DOI: 10.1017/pls.2018.3 PMID: 29717961
