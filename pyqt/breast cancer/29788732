The aim of our study was to assessthe clinical value of intra-operative histopathological examination of SLN. Ourstudy comprised 1284 invasive breast cancer patients in whom sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was carried out. SLN intra-operative histopathological assessmentwas routinely performed in patients treated within the first period(07.2013-06.2014). However, the decision regarding intra-operative assessment wasmade by the surgeon for the patients who underwent this evaluation in the laterperiod 07.2014-06.2015 and were submitted for BCT. BCT was performed in 72.4% of patients. In total, 316 patients (24.6%) developed SLN-metastasis. Within theperiod 07.2014-06.2015, SLN intra-operative microscopic evaluation was performed in 20.8% of patients submitted for BCT. ALND was omitted in 27.5% of patientsdemonstrating SLN metastasis, in comparison with 15.5% of the group from theprevious period (p=0.0094). The proportion of patients demonstratingmacrometastasis in SLN who received conservative treatment to the axillaincreased from 5.4% to 23.1% (p=0.0007). The choice of SLN finalhistopathological assessment may allow for deferral of decision on more extensivesurgery of the axilla in patients submitted for SLNB. The omission ofroutinely-performed SLN intra-operative histopathological evaluation has led to astatistically significant increase in the proportion of patients in whom completeALND was avoided.DOI: 10.4149/neo_2018_170321N202 PMID: 29788732
