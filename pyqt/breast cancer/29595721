Meanwhile,single-institution data demonstrate that physician payments for prostheticreconstruction are rising, while payments for autologous techniques areunchanged. This study aims to assess payment trends and variation for tissueexpander and free flap breast reconstruction.METHODS: The Blue Health Intelligence database was queried from 2009 to 2013,identifying women with claims for breast reconstruction. Trends in the incidence of surgery and physician reimbursement were characterized by method and yearusing regression models.RESULTS: There were 21,259 episodes of breast reconstruction, with a significant rise in tissue expander cases (incidence rate ratio, 1.09; p < 0.001) and anunchanged incidence of free flap cases (incidence rate ratio, 1.02; p = 0.222).Bilateral tissue expander cases reimbursed 1.32 times more than unilateral tissueexpanders, whereas bilateral free flaps reimbursed 1.61 times more thanunilateral variants. The total growth in adjusted tissue expander mean paymentswas 6.5 percent (from $2232 to $2378) compared with -1.8 percent (from $3858 to$3788) for free flaps. Linear modeling showed significant increases for tissueexpander reimbursements only. Surgeon payments varied more for free flaps (the25th to 75th percentile interquartile range was $2243 for free flaps versus $987 for tissue expanders).CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of tissue expander cases and reimbursements rose over a period where the incidence of free flap cases and reimbursements plateaued.Reasons for stagnation in free flaps are unclear; however, the opportunity costof performing this procedure may incentivize the alternative technique. Greaterpayment variation in autologous reconstruction suggests the opportunity fornegotiation with payers.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004205 PMCID: PMC5880309 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29595721
