After informed consent, adjuvant ET for 5 years wasprescribed. Primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR).Secondary endpoints were contralateral breast cancer and overall survival.RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2012, 603 women were included from 14 Swedish centers. Median age was 71.1 years (range 65-90). After a median follow-up of 68 months 16IBTR (cumulative incidence at five-year follow-up; 1.2%, 95% CI, 0.6% to 2.5%), 6regional recurrences (one combined with IBTR), 2 distant recurrences (bothwithout IBTR or regional recurrence) and 13 contralateral breast cancers wereobserved. There were 48 deaths. One death (2.1%) was due to breast cancer and 13 (27.1%) were due to other cancers (2 endometrial cancers). Five-year overallsurvival was 93.0% (95% CI, 90.5% to 94.9%).CONCLUSION: BCS and ET without RT seem to be a safe treatment option inwomen ≥ 65 years with early breast cancer and favorable histopathology. The risk of IBTR is comparable to the risk of contralateral breast cancer. Moreover,concurrent morbidity dominates over breast cancer as leading cause of death inthis cohort with low-risk breast tumors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
