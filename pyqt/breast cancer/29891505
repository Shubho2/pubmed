Triple-negative breastcancer (TNBC), a subtype that does not overexpress hormone receptors or HER2/NEU,is one of the most hypomethylated cancers observed. Here, we discovered that the TET1 DNA demethylase is specifically overexpressed in about 40% of patients with TNBC, where it is associated with hypomethylation of up to 10% of queried CpGsites and a worse overall survival. Through bioinformatic analyses in both breastand ovarian cancer cell line panels, we uncovered an intricate network connectingTET1 to hypomethylation and activation of cancer-specific oncogenic pathways,including PI3K, EGFR, and PDGF. TET1 expression correlated with sensitivity todrugs targeting the PI3K-mTOR pathway, and CRISPR-mediated deletion of TET1 intwo independent TNBC cell lines resulted in reduced expression of PI3K pathwaygenes, upregulation of immune response genes, and substantially reduced cellular proliferation, suggesting dependence of oncogenic pathways on TET1overexpression. Our work establishes TET1 as a potential oncogene thatcontributes to aberrant hypomethylation in cancer and suggests that TET1 couldserve as a druggable target for therapeutic intervention.Significance: This studyaddresses a critical gap in knowledge of how and why methylation is prognostic inbreast cancer and shows how this information can be used to stratify patientswith TNBC for targeted therapy.
