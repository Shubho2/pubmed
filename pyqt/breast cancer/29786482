Materials and Methods A database of all patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who underwentneoadjuvant chemotherapy between 2007 and 2015 was retrospectively reviewed.Patient demographic characteristics, mammographic appearance, molecular subtypeof cancer (luminal or nonluminal), radiologic response (based on breast magnetic resonance images), surgery, and pathologic response to treatment were recorded.Inter- and subgroup comparison was performed for presence of mammographicmicrocalcification and cancer subtype by using Mann-Whitney and χ2 tests andlogistic regression. Results A total of 111 patients with a median age of 49years (interquartile range, 40-57 years) were evaluated. Of these, 64.9% (72 of111) had mammographic microcalcifications, 63.1% (70 of 111) had luminal Bcancer, and 36.9% (41 of 111) had nonluminal HER2-positive cancer. Radiologicresponse to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was observed in 70.3% (78 of 111) ofpatients. Surgery was performed in 97.3% (108 of 111) of patients, and 30.6% (34 of 111) of patients underwent breast conservation. pCR was observed in 33.3% (37 of 111) of patients; 16.2% (18 of 111) showed residual ductal carcinoma in situand 50.5% (56 of 111) had residual invasive disease. The pCR rate was the same (P= .21) in patients with mammographic microcalcification (29.2% [21 of 72]) as in those without calcification (41.0% [16 of 39]). The pCR rate in patients withnonluminal HER2-positive cancers (46.3% [19 of 41]) was higher (P = .01) than in those with luminal B cancers (25.7% [18 of 70]). pCR was associated withnonluminal HER2-positive subtype (odds ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.8, 16.0; P = .01) and complete radiologic response (odds ratio, 20.4; 95% confidenceinterval: 3.3, 126.6; P = .01). Conclusion Patients with HER2-positive cancer andmammographic microcalcification can achieve pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Nonluminal HER2-positive subtype and complete radiologic response are predictors of pCR.© RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article .DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018170960 PMID: 29786482
