Specifically, EMT is associated withchemoresistance and poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer. However, no effective therapy targeting EMT has been developed. Here, we report thatperiostin, an extracellular matrix protein, was induced upon chemotherapy andtightly correlated with the EMT gene signature and poor prognosis in breastcancer. In triple-negative breast cancer xenografts, chemotherapy upregulatedperiostin expression in tumor cells, triggered expansion of mesenchymal tumorcells and promoted invasion in residual tumors. Knockdown of periostin inhibited outgrowth and invasion of mesenchymal tumor cells upon chemotherapy. Furthermore,chemotherapy upregulated cancer-specific variants of periostin and application ofa blocking antibody specifically targeting those variants overcamechemoresistance and halted disease progression without toxicity. Together, these data indicate that periostin plays a key role in EMT-dependent chemoresistanceand is a promising target to overcome chemoresistance in triple-negative breastcancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22340-7 PMCID: PMC5838092PMID: 29507310
