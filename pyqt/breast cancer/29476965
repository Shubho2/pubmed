Electronic address:akrahmanjkr@thenewcollege.in.Phyto-synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was achieved using aqueousgarlic, green tea and turmeric extracts, and characterized by differentspectroscopic techniques. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of richamount of biochemicals in these extracts, which serve as reducing and cappingagents for converting silver nitrate into AgNPs. FT IR spectroscopy confirmed therole of biomolecules in the bioreduction and efficient stabilization of AgNPs.UV-Vis DRS spectra showed a band around 450 nm characteristics of AgNPs. XRDpatterns revealed the crystalline nature of the synthesized AgNPs with fccstructure. SEM and TEM analysis revealed the spherical shape of the synthesizedAgNPs with an average particle size of 8 nm. EDX analysis confirmed the purity ofthe synthesized AgNPs with a strong signal at 3.2 keV. The antioxidant activitywas assessed by ABTS, DPPH, p-NDA, H2O2 and DMSO scavenging assays, in which the AgNPs synthesized using green method showed remarkable activity with respect tothe standard antioxidants ascorbic acid and rutin. In vitro cytotoxicity activitywas tested on four cancer cell lines such as human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7),cervical (HeLa), epithelioma (Hep-2) and lung (A549) along with one normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) cell line. The AgNPs synthesized using turmeric extractexhibits excellent antioxidant and cytotoxicity activity compared to thatsynthesized using other extracts.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
