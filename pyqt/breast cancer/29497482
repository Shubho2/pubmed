In breast cancer cells, wedemonstrated that sevoflurane promotes migration and angiogenesis in highfractional oxygen but not in air. Follow-up analysis of the peri-operative oxygenfraction trial found an association between high inspired oxygen during cancersurgery and reduced tumor-free survival. Here we evaluated effects of acute, highoxygen exposure on breast cancer cell viability, migration and secretion ofangiogenesis factors in vitro. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells wereexposed to 21%, 30%, 60%, or 80% v/v O2 for 3 hours. Cell viability at 24 hourswas determined by MTT and migration at 24 hours with the Orisâ„¢ Cell MigrationAssay. Secretion of angiogenesis factors at 24 hours was measured viamembrane-based immunoarray. Exposure to 30%, 60% or 80% oxygen did not affectcell viability. Migration of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells was increased by 60%oxygen (P = 0.012 and P = 0.007, respectively) while 30% oxygen increasedmigration in MCF-7 cells (P = 0.011). These effects were reversed bydimethyloxaloylglycine. In MDA-MB-231 cells high fractional oxygen increasedsecretion of angiogenesis factors monocyte chemotactic protein 1, regulated onactivation normal T-cell expressed and vascular endothelial growth factor. InMCF-7 cells, interleukin-8, angiogenin and vascular endothelial growth factorsecretion was significantly increased by high fractional oxygen. High oxygenexposure stimulates migration and secretion of angiogenesis factors in breastcancer cells in vitro.DOI: 10.4103/2045-9912.222446 PMCID: PMC5806442PMID: 29497482
