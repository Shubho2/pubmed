China.Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non‑coding RNAs that are >200 nucleotides inlength. Recent studies have identified a number of lncRNAs with critical roles invarious biological processes including tumorigenesis. Zinc finger antisense 1(ZFAS1) is a lncRNA that has recently been reported to be involved in theprogression of several human cancers. However, the biological function of ZFAS1in breast cancer remains to be elucidated. In order to determine the effect ofZFAS1 in breast cancer cells, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chainreaction (RT‑qPCR) was performed to measure ZFAS1 expression in cells from breastcancer cell lines. In addition, gain‑of‑function experiments were performedin vitro to investigate the biological role of ZFAS1. The results revealed thatZFAS1 expression was significantly downregulated in breast cancer cell lines whencompared with the levels in controls. In vitro experiments also demonstrated thatZFAS1 overexpression significantly suppressed cell proliferation by causing cell cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Further functionalassays indicated that ZFAS1 overexpression inhibited cell migration and invasion by regulating epithelial‑mesenchymal transition. These findings indicated thatthe lncRNA ZFAS1 may be a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, and thus, may serve as a potential therapeutic target for patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8707 PMCID: PMC5928617PMID: 29532866
