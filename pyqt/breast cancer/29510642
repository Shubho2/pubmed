Winter 2018;83(1):57-61.[One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification method - what is the future of sentinellymph node management?][Article in Czech]Kosťun J, Pešta M, Slunečko R, Vlasák P, Bouda J, Berezovskiy D, Topolčan O,Novotný Z, Presl J.OBJECTIVE: The article summarizes current possibilities of usage of the One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification method (OSNA) in the perioperative management ofsentinel lymph nodes in oncologic surgery. The principle of this method is thedetection of cytokeratin 19 (CK19) in the lymphatic tissue as a marker of themetastatic spread.DESIGN: Review article.SETTINGS: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital Pilsen,Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Prague; Department of Biology,Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Prague; Department ofImmunochemistry, University Hospital Pilsen, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen,Charles University, Prague; Sikl´s Department of Pathology, University HospitalPilsen, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Prague.METHODS: The review of the literature published until the end of April 2017available on the PubMed database was performed. The official abbreviation OSNAand the full name of the method One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification was used for search in this database.CONCLUSION: The usage of the OSNA method with the detection of CK 19 in thesentinel lymph nodes as a marker of metastatic spread to the lymphatic tissuecurrently represents an acceptable form of perioperative sentinel lymph nodemanagement in patients with breast and colorectal cancer. Until now publisheddata are pointing towards possible successful application of this method insentinel lymph node management in patients with some other malignancies, such as thyroid carcinoma, gastric cancer, uterus cancer and head and neck cancer. Moredata is needed to establish this method also in those neoplasms.PMID: 29510642
