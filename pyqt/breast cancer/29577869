United States.BACKGROUND: Membrane transport protein organic anion transporting polypeptide(OATP) 1B3 mediates cellular uptake of many drugs including anti-cancer drugs(e.g. paclitaxel). In addition to the well-recognized hepatic expression andfunction of OATP1B3 [named as liver-type (Lt) OATP1B3], OATP1B3 also expresses incancers and has been postulated to play a role in cancer therapy presumably byfacilitating influx of anticancer drugs. Recently, a cancer type (Ct)-OATP1B3mRNA variant was identified in colon and lung cancer tissues, which encodestruncated Ct-OATP1B3 with negligible transport activity. Other than colon andlung cancers, reports on mRNA expression of OATP1B3 in other cancers cannotdistinguish between the Lt- and Ct-OATP1B3.METHODS: The current studies specifically characterize expression of Lt- andCt-OATP1B3 mRNA in ovarian, prostate, bladder, breast, and lung tissues usingisoform-specific PCR primers.RESULTS: For the first time, Lt-OATP1B3 mRNA was detected in ovarian, prostate,bladder and breast cancers. The Lt-OATP1B3 expressed in ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 has a clear plasma membrane localization pattern as shown by confocal live cell imaging.CONCLUSION: Our data supports the potential role of Lt-OATP1B3 in cancer therapy.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1872312812666180326110146 PMID: 29577869
