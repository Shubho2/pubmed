CDKN2A (which encodes p16) mRNA expression was also analyzed in a subset (N=2,280) mostly representing HGSC (N=2,010). Association of p16expression with overall survival (OS) was determined within histotypes as wasCDKN2A expression for HGSC only. p16 block expression was most frequent in HGSC(56%) but neither protein nor mRNA expression was associated with OS. However,relative to heterogeneous expression, block expression was associated withshorter OS in endometriosis-associated carcinomas, clear cell (HR: 2.02, 95%CI1.47-2.77, p< 0.001) and endometrioid (HR: 1.88, 95%CI 1.30- 2.75, p=0.004),while absence was associated with shorter OS in low-grade serous carcinomas (HR: 2.95, 95%CI 1.61-5.38, p=0.001). Absence was most frequent in mucinous carcinoma (50%), and was not associated with OS in this histotype. The prognostic value of p16 expression is histotype-specific and pattern dependent. We provide definitiveevidence against an association of p16 expression with survival in ovarian HGSCas previously suggested. Block expression of p16 in clear cell and endometrioidcarcinoma should be further validated as a prognostic marker, and absence inlow-grade serous carcinoma justifies CDK4 inhibition.
