Thecurrent gold standard for categorizing breast density consists of a radiologistestimation of percent density according to the American College of Radiology(ACR) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) criteria. This studycompares paired qualitative interpretations of breast density on digitalmammograms with quantitative measurement of density using Hologic's Food and DrugAdministration-approved R2 Quantra volumetric breast density assessment tool. Ourgoal was to find the best cutoff value of Quantra-calculated breast density forstratifying patients accurately into high-risk and low-risk breast densitycategories.Methods: Screening digital mammograms from 385 subjects, aged 18 to 64 years,were evaluated. These mammograms were interpreted by a radiologist using theACR's BI-RADS density method, and had quantitative density measured using the R2 Quantra breast density assessment tool. The appropriate cutoff for breastdensity-based risk stratification using Quantra software was calculated usingmanually determined BI-RADS scores as a gold standard, in which scores of D3/D4denoted high-risk densities and D1/D2 denoted low-risk densities.Results: The best cutoff value for risk stratification using Quantra-calculatedbreast density was found to be 14.0%, yielding a sensitivity of 65%, specificity of 77%, and positive and negative predictive values of 75% and 69%, respectively.Under bootstrap analysis, the best cutoff value had a mean ± SD of13.70% ± 0.89%.Conclusions: Our study is the first to publish on a North American populationthat assesses the accuracy of the R2 Quantra system at breast densitystratification. Quantitative breast density measures will improve accuracy andreliability of density determination, assisting future researchers to accurately calculate breast cancer risks associated with density increase.DOI: 10.1177/1178223418759296 PMCID: PMC5826095PMID: 29511356
