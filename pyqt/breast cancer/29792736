Patientswho were pregnant, were lactating, had a history of breast cancer, or presentedwith palpable nipple or skin findings were excluded.RESULTS: A total of 799 patients met the study criteria. Pain was diffuse in 30%,was focal in 30%, and was not localized in 40%. Of the 799 patients with breastpain, 790 (99%) presented for a diagnostic evaluation; 759 (95%) of theseevaluated patients had negative findings. A benign sonographic correlate wasdetected in the area of pain in 5% of patients (39/799). One patient had a singlecancer detected in the contralateral asymptomatic breast. When correlationsbetween breast pain and the presence of cancer in the study patients werecompared with the concurrent cancer detection rate in the screening population(5.5 cases per 1000 examinations performed), breast pain was not found to be asign of breast cancer (p = 0.027). Patients younger than 40 years (316/799)underwent a total of 454 workup studies for breast pain; all findings werebenign, and the cost of these studies was $87,322. Patients 40 years or older(483/799) underwent 745 workup studies, for a cost of $152,732.CONCLUSION: Breast pain represents an area of overutilization of health careresources. For female patients who present with pure breast pain, breast imaging centers should consider the following imaging protocols and education forreferring physicians: an annual screening mammogram should be recommended forwomen 40 years or older, and reassurance without imaging should be offered topatients younger than 40 years.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.17.18879 PMID: 29792736
