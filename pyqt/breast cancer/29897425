While multiple types of genetic,epigenetic and expression changes have been implicated in ovarian cancer,existing prognostic biomarker strategies are constrained to analyzing a singleclass of molecular variations. The extra predictive power afforded by theintegration of multiple omics types remains largely unexplored. In this study, weperformed integrative analysis on tumor-based exome-, transcriptome- andmethylome-wide molecular profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) forvariations in cancer-relevant genes to construct robust, cross-validatedmultiomic predictors for ovarian cancer survival. These integrated polygenicsurvival scores (PSSs) were able to predict 5-year overall (OS) andprogression-free survival in the Caucasian subsample with high accuracy (AUROC = 0.87 and 0.81, respectively). These findings suggest that the PSSs are able topredict long-term OS in TCGA patients with accuracy beyond that of previouslyproposed protein-based biomarker strategies. Our findings reveal the promise ofan integrated omics-based approach in enhancing existing prognostic strategies.Future investigations should be aimed toward prospective external validation,strategies for standardizing application and the integration of germlinevariants.DOI: 10.1093/carcin/bgy055 PMCID: PMC6031025 [Available on 2019-07-03]PMID: 29897425
