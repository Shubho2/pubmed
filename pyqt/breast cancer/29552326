Here we are focusing on roles of FOXC1 andtheir mechanisms in cancers. FOXC1 promoted progress of many cancers, such asbreast cancer (especially basal-like breast cancer), hepatocellular carcinoma,gastric cancer and so on. FOXC1 was also found to be associated with drugresistance of cancers. FOXC1 promoted metastasis of cancers by increasingexpression of MMP7, NEDD9 and Snail. Proliferation and invasion of cancers wereincreased by FOXC1 by mediating NF-ÎºB, MST1R and KLF4 expression. FOXC1 wasassociated with development by regulating expression of FGF19 and MSX1. Recently,FOXC1 was found to be required for niche of stem cells or development of stemcells by mediating expression of Gli2, CXCL12, SCF, NFATC1, BMP and Myh7.Overall, FOXC1 exerts its functions by many mechanisms and may be used as apotential biomarker for diseases.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.22527 PMCID: PMC5844762PMID: 29552326
