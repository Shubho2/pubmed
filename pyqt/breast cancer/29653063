Using the gene-based haplotype-tagging SNPs strategy, we evaluated the association between six ZNF350 polymorphisms and breast cancer risk in a case-control set from anorthern Chinese population. The impact of ZNF350 variations on transcriptionalrepression of GADD45α was also examined. It was found that ZNF350 rs2278420(L66P) and rs2278415 (S501R) missense genetic variants are in complete linkagedisequilibrium and have a significant impact on inter-individual susceptibilityto breast cancer. Additionally, ZNF350 GGCGT or GGCGC haplotype is alsoassociated with a significantly increased breast cancer risk compared with theGGCAC haplotype. ZNF350 L66P variant modifies the risk of breast cancer not only by itself but also in a gene-environment interaction manner with age, age atmenarche, menopause status, or estrogen receptor status. Interestingly, weobserved that ZNF350 L66P and S501R SNPs could weaken the capability ofZNF350-mediated GADD45α transcription repression and it may be an underlyingmechanism of the observed epidemiological associations. Our results highlightZNF350 as an important gene in human mammary oncogenesis and ZNF350 missensegenetic polymorphisms confer susceptibility to breast cancer.DOI: 10.1089/dna.2018.4160 PMID: 29653063  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
