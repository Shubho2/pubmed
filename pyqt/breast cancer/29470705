Both calcitriol and weight-bearing exerciseimprove bone metabolism for osteoporotic patients, but are unproven in a breastcancer population. We used a novel high-dose calcitriol regimen with anindividualized exercise intervention to improve bone metabolism in breast cancer survivors.METHODS: We accrued 41 subjects to this open label, 2 × 2 factorial, randomizedfeasibility trial. Breast cancer survivors were randomized to receive thefollowing: (1) calcitriol (45 micrograms/week), (2) individualized exercise with progressive walking and resistance training, (3) both, or (4) a dailymultivitamin (control condition) for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes included changes in biomarkers of bone formation, bone resorption, and the bone remodeling index, a composite measure of bone formation and resorption. Safety measures includedclinical and biochemical adverse events. A main effect analysis was used forthese endpoints.RESULTS: Hypercalcemia was limited to three grade I cases with no grade ≥ 2cases. Among exercisers, 100% engaged in the prescribed aerobic training and44.4% engaged in the prescribed resistance training. Calcitriol significantlyimproved bone formation (Cohen's d = 0.64; p < 0.01), resulting in anon-significant increase in the bone remodeling index (Cohen's d = 0.21; p = 31).Exercise failed to improve any of the bone biomarkers.CONCLUSIONS: Both calcitriol and exercise were shown to be feasible and welltolerated. Calcitriol significantly improved bone formation, resulting in a netincrease of bone metabolism. Compliance with the exercise intervention wassub-optimal, which may have led to a lack of effect of exercise on bonemetabolism.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4094-4 PMCID: PMC6019129 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29470705
