The purpose of thisstudy was to evaluate whether 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake in breastcancer is influenced by physiological hormonal fluctuations.METHODS: A total of 160 primary invasive breast cancers from 155 females (54premenopausal, 101 postmenopausal) who underwent 18F-FDG positron emissiontomography/computed tomography before therapy were retrospectively analyzed. The maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of tumors were compared withmenstrual phases and menopausal status according to the following subgroups:'luminal A-like,' 'luminal B-like,' and 'non-luminal.' Additionally, the effectof estradiol (E2) on 18F-FDG uptake in breast cancer cells was evaluated invitro.RESULTS: Among premenopausal patients, SUVmax during the periovulatory-lutealphase was significantly higher than that during the follicular phase in luminalA-like tumors (n = 25, p = 0.004), while it did not differ between the follicularphase and the periovulatory-luteal phase in luminal B-like (n = 24) andnon-luminal tumors (n = 7). Multiple regression analysis showed menstrual phase, tumor size, and Ki-67 index are independent predictors for SUVmax inpremenopausal luminal A-like tumors. There were no significant differences inSUVmax between pre- and postmenopausal patients in any of the subgroups. In invitro studies, uptake in estrogen receptor-positive cells was significantlyaugmented when E2 concentration was increased from 0.01 to ≥ 1 nM.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that 18F-FDG uptake may be impacted byphysiological hormonal fluctuations during menstrual cycle in luminal A-likecancers, and that E2 could be partly responsible for these events.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4711-4 PMID: 29423901
