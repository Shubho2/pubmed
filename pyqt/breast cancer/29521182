Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the genes encoding miRNAs can altertheir expression and may influence cancer risks. This case-control study exploredthe relationship between three microRNA polymorphisms (miR-27a, miR-196a2 and miR-146a) and breast cancer (BC). Methods A total of 353 breast cancer cases and 353controls were genotyped for miR-27a (rs895819), miR-196a2 (rs11614913) and miR-146a (rs2910164). The miR-27a and miR-146a variants were discriminated using aPCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method, while miR-196a2 wereanalysed by tetra-primers amplification refractory mutation system PCR. Oddsratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to estimateassociations. Results The CC homozygous genotype of miR-146a (rs2910164) was seenin 45(12.7%) patients with breast cancer and 18(5.1%) controls (OR 4.09 [95%CI2.19-7.67] p < 0.001). The minor allele G of miR-27a was associated with adecreased risk of breast cancer (OR 0.24 [95% CI 0.14-0.42] p < 0.001). ThemiR-196a2 (rs11614913) was not related to breast cancer (p > 0.05). ConclusionOur data indicate that miR-146a (rs2910164) and miR-27a (rs895819) variantscontribute to breast cancer. Further studies in larger populations includingother genetic and environmental factors are required to achieve a definitiveconclusion.DOI: 10.1080/09674845.2017.1399572 PMID: 29521182
