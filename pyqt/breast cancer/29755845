Quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) reflects bothtotal receptor content and binding affinity. To study factors that may alterradiopharmaceutical binding and impact PET accuracy, assays that can separatereceptor amount from binding affinity are needed. The study purpose was toquantify the binding parameters of [18F]FES and [18F]FFNP in breast cancer.Estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive breastcancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D) were used to measure [18F]FES and [18F]FFNPbinding parameters via saturation and competitive binding curves. The equilibriumdissociation constant (Kd) and total receptor density (Bmax) were determinedusing nonlinear regression of the saturation binding curves. Half-maximalinhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined using nonlinear regression of the competitive binding curves. Linear correlation between increasing cell number andtracer uptake was observed for both [18F]FES and [18F]FFNP (R2=0.99 and 0.91,respectively). Using [18F]FES, the Kd for ER in MCF-7 cells was 0.13±0.02 nM witha Bmax of 1901±89.3 fmol/mg protein and IC50 of 0.085 nM (95% CI: 0.069-0.104nM). Using [18F]FFNP, the Kd for PR in T47D cells was 0.41±0.05 nM with a Bmax of1984±75.6 fmol/mg protein and IC50 of 2.6 nM (95% CI: 2.0-3.4 nM). The ligandbinding function of ER and PR can be quantified using [18F]FES and [18F]FFNP and are comparable to previous studies using tritiated radioligands. [18F]FES and[18F]FFNP can be used in cell-based assays to quantify receptor-radioligandbinding affinity, which cannot be obtained from a single PET examination.PMCID: PMC5944827PMID: 29755845
