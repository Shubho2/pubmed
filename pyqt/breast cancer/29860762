Methods: From1999 to 2013, 63 women with IBTR after breast conserving surgery wereretrospectively reviewed. All patients had adequate information on tumor locationboth at first presentation and at recurrence, with or without regional recurrenceor distant metastasis. The histologic changes between true local recurrence andelsewhere recurrence groups were compared. The local recurrence, the overallsurvival after IBTR (IBTR-OS), the disease-free survival after IBTR (IBTR-DFS)were also compared. Results: All patients had undergone lumpectomy, including 38 cases with additional axillary lymph node dissection and 13 cases with sentinellymph node biopsy. There were 11.3% (7/63) cases received neoadjuvant systemictherapy, 68.3% (43/63) had adjuvant radiotherapy, 60.3% (38/63) underwentadjuvant chemotherapy and 47.6% (30/63) received hormonal therapy. Forty-fivecases (71.4%) had recurrence in the same quadrant, and 18 cases (28.6%) hadelsewhere recurrence. Compared with histology at presentation, 10.3% of thepatients (6/58) had different ones at recurrence and 28.9% of patients (13/45)had different molecular subtypes. The conversion rate of estrogen receptor status(33.3% vs 9.5%, P=0.012) and progesterone receptor status (56.3% vs 19.0%,P=0.005) in patients with elsewhere recurrence was significantly higher than thatin patients with same quadrant recurrence. Fifty-nine cases had undergone surgeryafter IBTR, with 48 cases of secondary breast-conserving surgery and 11 cases of salvage mastectomy. The median time to IBTR of same quadrant recurrence andelsewhere recurrence groups were 26 months and 62 months (P=0.012), respectively.There were 84.4% and 44.4% cases who had local recurrence within 5 years afterbreast conserving surgery, respectively. Of all cases, the overall 5-year IBTR-OSand 5-year IBTR-DFS rates were 79.4% and 60.4%, respectively. There were nosignificant differences in 5-year IBTR-OS (77.4% vs. 83.6%, P=0.303) or 5-yearIBTR-DFS (60.0% vs. 62.8%, P=0.780) between same quadrant recurrence andelsewhere recurrence groups. Univariate analysis showed that pN0-1 (P<0.001),luminal subtype (P=0.026), adjuvant endocrine therapy (P=0.007) at firstpresentation, recurrent tumor < 3 cm (P=0.036) and having surgery afterIBTR(P=0.002) were favorable factors of IBTR-OS. pN0-1 (P<0.001) at firstpresentation, recurrent tumor stage Ⅰ-Ⅱ (P<0.001) and having surgery afterIBTR(P=0.001) were favorable factors of IBTR-DFS. There was no significantdifference between second breast-conserving surgery and salvage mastectomy inIBTR-OS and IBTR-DFS (P>0.05). Conclusions: The IBTR after breast conservingsurgery mainly occurred at the original quadrant. Second breast-conservingsurgery did not affect patient's prognosis. There were significant differences inbiological features between the same quadrant recurrence and elsewhererecurrence, requiring different therapeutic strategies in the future.Publisher: 目的：分析乳腺癌保乳术后同侧乳腺癌复发(IBTR)患者的临床特征及预后。方法：回顾性分析1999—2013年行保乳手术治疗后IBTR的63例女性乳腺癌患者，原发和复发象限部位明确，伴或不伴有区域复发和(或)远处转移，比较同象限复发组与异象限复发组患者的病理特征变化情况、局部复发时间和IBTR后的总生存率(IBTR-OS)、无病生存率(IBTR-DFS)。 结果：63例患者初诊时均接受了保乳手术治疗，其中行腋窝淋巴结清扫38例，前哨淋巴结活检13例。11.1%(7/63)的患者行新辅助治疗，68.3%(43/63)行辅助放疗，60.3%(38/63)行辅助化疗，47.6%(30/63)行辅助内分泌治疗。45例(71.4%)的患者为同象限复发，18例(28.6%)为异象限复发。复发肿瘤与初诊时比较，10.3%(6/58)的患者病理组织类型发生了改变，28.9%(13/45)分子分型发生了改变。异象限复发组的雌激素受体(ER)和孕激素受体(PR)状态变化率明显高于同象限复发组(33.3%和9.5%，P＝0.012；56.3%和19.0%，P＝0.005)。全组有59例患者在IBTR后接受了手术治疗，其中二次保乳术11例，挽救性全乳切除术48例。同象限复发组和异象限复发组的中位局部复发时间分别为26和62个月，分别有84.4%和44.4%的患者在术后5年内复发(P＝0.012)。全组患者IBTR后5年OS和DFS分别为79.4%和60.4%，其中同象限复发组和异象限复发组的5年IBTR-OS分别为77.4%和83.6%(P＝0.303)，5年IBTR-DFS分别为60.0%和62.8%(P＝0.780)。单因素分析显示，pN0～1(P<0.001)、初诊Luminal型(P＝0.026)、初诊接受内分泌治疗(P＝0.007)、复发肿瘤最大径<3cm(P＝0.036)和IBTR后接受手术治疗(P＝0.002)的患者IBTR-OS具有优势，初诊pN0～1(P<0.001)、复发分期为Ⅰ～Ⅱ期(P<0.001)和IBTR后接受手术治疗(P＝0.001)的患者IRTR-DFS具有优势，但二次保乳术与挽救性全乳切除术患者的IBTR-OS和IBTR-DFS差异均无统计学意义(均P>0.05)。结论：乳腺癌保乳术后IBTR以同象限复发为主，二次保乳术不影响患者预后。同象限复发和异象限复发肿瘤具有不同的生物学特性，需要采取不同的治疗策略。.PMID: 29860762  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
