The synthesised derivatives were in vitro evaluated for theiranti-proliferative activity towards lung A-549, colon HT-29, and breast ZR-75human cancer cell lines. Compounds 5b, 5c, 7b, and 10e emerged as the most potentderivatives with average IC50 values of 4.37, 2.53, 2.14, and 4.66 µM,respectively, which are superior to Sunitinib (average IC50 = 8.11 µM).Furthermore, compounds 7b and 10e were evaluated for their effects on cell cycle progression and levels of phosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb) protein in the A-549cancer cell line. Moreover, 7b and 10e inhibited the cell growth of themultidrug-resistant lung cancer NCI-H69AR cell line with IC50 = 16 µM. Inaddition, the cytotoxic activities of 7b and 10e were assessed towards threenon-tumorigenic cell lines (Intestine IEC-6, Breast MCF-10A, and FibroblastSwiss-3t3) where both compounds displayed mean tumor selectivity index (1.6 and1.8) higher than that of Sunitinib (1.4).DOI: 10.1080/14756366.2018.1462802 PMID: 29707975  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
