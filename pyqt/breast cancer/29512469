Despite many patients benefiting from Tamoxifen as an effective anti-hormonal agent in adjuvant therapy, a noticeable number ofpatients tend to develop resistance.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to shed light upon the molecular mechanisms associated with Tamoxifen resistance which can help improve current treatmentstrategies available for stimulating responsiveness and combating resistance.METHODS: Relevant articles were obtained from PubMed and google scholar, nearlyall dated from 2010 to 2017. Articles were screened to select the ones meetingthe objective. The molecular interactions in the resistant network were extractedfrom the appropriate articles.RESULTS: The mechanisms of developing Tamoxifen resistance were briefly outlined.Overactivation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) pathways, commonly known asalternative growth cascades, is one of the main players in acquired cancer cellstemness, which can induce unrestricted proliferation in the presence ofTamoxifen. There are seven recent patents including 6291496B1 as an anti-HER2,8143226B2 as an inhibitor of RTK phosphorylation, 9062308B2 as an anti-HOXB7,Lapatinib functioning as an anti-EGFR/HER2, Everolimus as an inhibitor of mTOR,Exemestane as an aromatase inhibitor and Perifosine as an AKT inhibitor.CONCLUSION: Altogether, it seems that tumor cells express a stemness phenotypewhich tends to override anti-hormonal adjuvant therapies. Since RTKs areoveractivated and overexpressed in such cells, specialized targeted therapiessuppressing RTKs would be a novel and effective way in restoring Tamoxifensensitivity in resistant breast cancer tumor cells.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1574892813666180305164634 PMID: 29512469
