Thus, it is important to develop sensitive methods to detect these mutations. We established a novel detection method using aquenching probe (QP) system to identify PIK3CA mutations, using DNA from 309breast cancer tissues. In a developmental cohort, we determined the optimaldetection threshold of the QP system with human tumor DNA from 119 freshly frozentumor samples. We found a 96% concordance rate with the QP system between DNAfrom 26 matching fresh-frozen specimens and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded(FFPE) specimens from the same patients, and known PIK3CA mutation status in the developmental cohort. In a validation cohort, we evaluated whether the threshold for judging mutations using the QP system with frozen specimen-derived DNA wasapplicable with FFPE-derived DNA. In the validation cohort, 30 DNA samples from190 FFPE-derived DNA samples with known PIK3CA mutation status were analyzed bydirect sequencing (DS) and droplet digital PCR, in a blinded manner. Thesensitivity and specificity of the droplet digital PCR results were 100% and 100%(QP system), and 60% and 100% (DS), respectively. We also analyzed therelationship between clinical outcomes and the PIK3CA mutational status of 309breast cancer samples, including the developmental cohort and validation cohortsamples. Multivariate analysis suggested that PIK3CA mutations, especiallyH1047R, were prognostic factors of relapse-free survival. Our novel detectionsystem could be more useful than DS for detecting clinical PIK3CA mutations.Â© 2018 The Authors.
