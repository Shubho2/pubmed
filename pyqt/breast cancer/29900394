This study is cross-sectional study which is part of the study toestimate Gene-Environment Interaction in women with breast cancer withcase-control studies in Shiraz. In this study, two control groups have been used.The sample size of 300 was specified for each group. Selection sources of groups include Cancer Registry Center and referred people to surgical and internal ward of Shahid Mottahari Clinic. Information collect tools have included Form No. 1 inCancer Registry Center which includes information of age, use of oralcontraceptives history, breastfeeding history, number of live births, age atmenarche, age at first childbirth, etc. Considering the results obtained, it was showed that the highest frequency (144) in the group of Cancer Registry Centerbelongs to high school education, but the highest frequency of Shahid MottahariClinic is related to primary education (176).There is statistically significantdifference between the two groups in terms of education, history of breast cancerin first-degree relatives and age at first birth, (P<0.05). Due to the easyavailability of data on non-cancer patients referred to the cancer registrycenter, researchers may be encouraged to use them as a control group, but we mustbear in mind that, this Group may be different in terms of some variables, andthis difference leads to bias in the estimation of considered exposure effects.DOI: 10.1016/j.dib.2018.05.045 PMCID: PMC5997904PMID: 29900394
