Ultrasound (US) and microbubble (MB) mediated sonoporation was used for efficient delivery of the TK-NTR-DNA-NP complex to TNBCtumor in vivo for cancer therapy. Therapeutic effect was evaluated by treatingTNBC cells in vitro and tumor xenograft in vivo by using prodrugs ganciclovir(GCV) and CB1954.RESULTS: TNBC cells treated with GCV/CB1954 prodrugs after transfection ofTK-NTR-DNA by PEGylated-PLGA/PEI NP resulted in high apoptotic-index. US-MBimage-guided delivery of TK-NTR-DNA-NP complex displayed significant expressionlevel of TK-NTR protein and showed tumor reduction when treated with GCV/CB1954prodrugs in TNBC xenograft in vivo.CONCLUSION: US-MB image-guided delivery of TK-NTR gene by PEGylated-PLGA/PEI NPs could be a potential prodrug therapy for TNBC in the clinic.DOI: 10.2217/nnm-2017-0328 PMID: 29790803
