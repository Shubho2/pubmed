Perspective of aRadiation Oncologist.Christopherson KM(1), Smith BD(2).Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson CancerCenter, Boone Pickens Academic Tower (FCT6.5075), 1515 Holcombe Boulevard,Houston, TX 77030, USA.(2)Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson CancerCenter, Unit 1202, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA. Electronicaddress: Bsmith3@mdanderson.org.Radiation therapy is used in many cases of both early and late breast cancer. Theauthors examine the role of MR imaging as it pertains to radiotherapy planningand treatment approaches for patients with breast cancer. MR imaging can assistthe radiation oncologist in determining the best radiation approach and increating treatment planning volumes. MR imaging may be useful in the setting ofaccelerated partial breast irradiation. Radiation oncologists should attend to MRbreast images, when obtained, to ensure that these imaging findings are takeninto consideration when developing a radiation therapy plan.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.
