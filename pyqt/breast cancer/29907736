To develop a QVS in BCSs anddetermine its validity and reliability. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the qualitativestudy, a total of 21 BCSs were interviewed by purposive sampling and snowballsampling; and in the quantitative study, a total of 249 BCSs, who were admittedand received outpatient follow-up, were investigated. Regarding constructvalidity, factor analysis was performed. The female sexual function index (FSFI),self-rating depression scale (SDS), and Locke-Wallace marital adjustment test(LWMAT) were used to evaluate criterion validity. Cronbach's alpha coefficientwas used as an index of internal consistency. To evaluate test-retestreliability, 50 patients were re-evaluated after 1 week. RESULTS We put 28 items in the factor analysis model: (1) 5 factors were extracted by exploratory factor analysis (EFA), with a cumulative contribution of 60.37%; (2) the confirmatoryfactor analysis (CFA) showed that the path coefficients among the factors wereall above 0.5, and the standardized load coefficients of the most items wereabove 0.5; (3) the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.929 for the overallquestionnaire, and ranged from 0.571 to 0.869 for the 5 factors; (4) thecorrelation coefficients between the overall questionnaire and the FSFI, SDS, andLWMAT were 0.582, -0.456 and 0.515, respectively (P<0.01); and (5) thetest-retest correlation coefficient was 0.816, and the split-half-reliabilitycoefficient was 0.899. CONCLUSIONS The QVS in BCSs has good reliability andvalidity, and can be used to assess the quality of sexual life among BCSs inMainland China.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.906666 PMCID: PMC6035499PMID: 29907736
