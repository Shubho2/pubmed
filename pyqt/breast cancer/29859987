Despitethe development of highly effective targeted agents, drug resistance and disease progression remain major clinical concerns. Improved understanding of themolecular mechanisms mediating drug resistance will allow new treatments to bedeveloped. The forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) transcription factor is overexpressed inbreast cancer and strongly associated with resistance to targeted therapies andchemotherapy. FoxM1 regulates all hallmarks of cancer, including proliferation,mitosis, EMT, invasion, and metastasis. Inhibition of FoxM1 transcription factor function is a potential strategy for overcoming breast cancer progression. Inthis research update, we review the role of FoxM1 in breast cancer andpharmacological approaches for blocking FoxM1 transcription factor function.Future preclinical studies should evaluate combination drug strategies to inhibitFoxM1 function and upstream kinase signaling pathways as potential strategies to treat resistant and metastatic breast cancers.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
