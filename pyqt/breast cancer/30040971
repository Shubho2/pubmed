Electronic address: laleh.alisaraie@mun.ca.Many studies have shown that toxicities of anticancer drugs and their adverseeffects are related to their chemical structure and high molecular weight thatmay result in a number of metabolites interacting with drug off-target networks. These factors require further attention for advancing cancer treatment anddecreasing toxicities caused by the molecular complexity of antineoplasticagents. Providing more target-selective and tolerable cancer therapy with fewerside effects would not only improve patients' compliance, but also would decreasecancer-remission rates. This review presents several antineoplastic agents andtheir metabolites with molecular weights greater than 500 g/mol, which reportedlycause more than fifteen types of adverse reactions during breast cancer therapy.Crown Copyright © 2018.
