Several studies reportedsignificantly distinct prognosis for TNAC when compared with most of thenon-apocrine triple negative (NATN) tumors. This is a case-control studyreporting onoutcomes from our long-term single-center experience.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinicopathologic features of a series of46 TNAC tumors treated in a 15-year period. Tumor characteristics and outcomeshave been compared with a homogeneous control series of 43 NATN tumors treatedduring the same follow-up period. Local relapse-free survival (LRFS), distantmetastases-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) have been evaluated.RESULTS: LRFS in the TNAC group was 85% and 78% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. LRFS in the NATN group was 90% and 79% at 5 and 10 years, respectively (hazardratio [HR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-3.19; P = .80). DMFS in the TNAC group was 85% and 85% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. DMFS in the NATNgroup was 85% and 75% at 5 and 10 years, respectively (HR, 0.39; 95% CI,0.14-1.08; P = .071). OS in the TNAC group was 86% and 83% at 5 and 10 years,respectively. OS in the NATN group was 86% and 63% at 5 and 10 years,respectively. OS was significantly better in the TNAC group (HR, 0.45; 95% CI,0.20-0.99; P = .049).CONCLUSIONS: TNAC seems to represent a distinct group of triple negative breastcancer, characterized by a favorable long-term outcome when compared with NATNtumors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
