[Epub ahead of print]18F-Alfatide II PET/CT for Identification of Breast Cancer: A PreliminaryClinical Study.Wu J(1), Wang S(1), Zhang X(2), Teng Z(1), Wang J(1), Yung B(3), Niu G(4), ZhuH(1), Lu G(1), Chen X(4).Author information: (1)Nanjing University, China.(2)Xiamen University, China.(3)NIH, United States.(4)National Institutes of Health, China.18F-Alfatide II has been proven to have excellent clinical translationalpotential. In this study, we investigated 18F-Alfatide II for identifying breast cancer and compared the performances between 18F-Alfatide II and 18F-FDG.Methods: Forty-four female patients suspected of primary breast cancer wererecruited. PET/CT images using 18F-Alfatide II and 18F-FDG were acquired withinseven days. Tracer uptakes in breast lesions were evaluated by visual analysis,semiquantitative analysis with maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) andmean standardized uptake value (SUVmean). Results: Forty-two breast cancerlesions and 11 benign breast lesions were confirmed by histopathology in 44patients. Both 18F-Alfatide II and 18F-FDG had higher uptake in breast cancerlesions than in benign breast lesions (P < 0.05 for 18F-Alfatide II, P < 0.05 for18F-FDG). The area under the curve (AUC) of 18F-Alfatide II was slightly lessthan that of 18F-FDG. Both 18F-Alfatide II and 18F-FDG had high sensitivity(88.1% vs. 90.5%), high positive predictive value (PPV) (88.1% vs. 88.4%),moderate specificity (54.5% vs. 54.5%), and moderate negative predictive value(NPV) (54.5% vs. 60.0%) for differentiating breast cancer from benign breastlesions. By combining 18F-Alfatide II and 18F-FDG, the sensitivity and NPVsignificantly increased to 97.6% and 85.7%, respectively, with PPV slightlyincreased to 89.1%, and no change to the specificity (54.5%). The uptake of18F-Alfatide II (SUVmax: 3.77±1.78) was significantly lower than that of 18F-FDG (SUVmax: 7.37±4.48) in breast cancer lesions (P < 0.05). 18F-Alfatide II uptakein triple-negative subtype was significantly lower than that in Luminal A andLuminal B subtypes. By contrast, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)overexpressing subtype had higher 18F-FDG uptake than other three subtypes. Therewere 8 breast cancer lesions with higher 18F-Alfatide II uptake than 18F-FDGuptake, which all had a common characteristic that HER-2 expression was negative and estrogen receptor (ER) expression was strongly positive.Conclusion:18F-Alfatide II is suitable for clinical use in breast cancerpatients. 18F-Alfatide II is of good performance, but not superior to 18F-FDG in identifying breast cancer. 18F-Alfatide II may have superiority to 18F-FDG indetecting breast cancer with strongly positive ER expression and negative HER-2expression.Copyright © 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.208637 PMID: 29700127
