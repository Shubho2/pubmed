The adjusted hazard ratio for breast cancer was 1.17 (95% confidenceinterval 0.80-1.70). The long-term risk of breast cancer among women who had aT-CT remains unknown.SUMMARY: Background The risk of breast cancer may be higher with direct exposure to ionizing radiation from thoracic computed tomography (CT)during pregnancy or the postpartum. We evaluated the short-term risk of maternal breast cancer after exposure to thoracic CT during these periods. Methods Wecompleted a retrospective population-based cohort study of all deliveries between1995 and 2014 using universal healthcare databases in the province of Ontario,Canada. The main exposure was thoracic CT in pregnancy or ≤ 42 days postpartum.The passive exposure was ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy (VQ) scan inpregnancy or ≤ 42 days postpartum. Each was compared to pregnancies unexposed to thoracic CT or VQ scan. The primary study outcome was newly diagnosed breastcancer starting 366 days post-index delivery date. Results A total of 5859pregnancies were exposed to thoracic CT, 4075 to VQ scan and 1 292 059 toneither. Starting from 1 year after the index delivery, the median duration offollow-up was 5.9, 7.3 and 11.1 years, respectively. A total of 10 129 women werediagnosed with breast cancer, of whom 9039 (89.2%) were aged ≤ 50 years. Therewere 27 new cases of breast cancer (7.1 per 10 000 person-years) followingthoracic CT vs. 10 080 (7.0 per 10 000 person-years) among the unexposed, anadjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.70).Following VQ scan exposure, the incidence rate of breast cancer was 7.0 per10 000 person-years, an adjusted HR of 1.23 (95% CI 0.81-1.87), compared with theunexposed cohort. Conclusion Exposure to thoracic CT during pregnancy or thepostpartum was not associated with an increased short-term risk of maternalbreast cancer. The long-term risk should be studied.© 2018 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.DOI: 10.1111/jth.13980 PMID: 29450965
