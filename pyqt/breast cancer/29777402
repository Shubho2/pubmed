Moststudies rely on administrative data that cannot delineate scan intent (promptedby signs/symptoms vs. asymptomatic surveillance). This is a critical gap asintent is the only way to distinguish overuse from appropriate care.OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess surveillance systemic imaging post-breast cancertreatment in a national sample accounting for scan intent.METHODS: A stage-stratified random sample of 10 women with stage II-III breastcancer in 2006-2007 was selected from each of 1217 Commission onCancer-accredited facilities, for a total of 10,838 patients. Registrarsabstracted scan type (computed tomography [CT], non-breast magnetic resonanceimaging, bone scan, positron emission tomography/CT) and intent (cancer-relatedvs. not, asymptomatic surveillance vs. not) from medical records for 5Â yearspost-diagnosis. Data were merged with each patient's corresponding NationalCancer Database record, containing sociodemographic and tumor/treatmentinformation.RESULTS: Of 10,838 women, 30% had one or more, and 12% had two or more, systemic surveillance scans during a 4-year follow-up period. Patients were more likely toreceive surveillance imaging in the first follow-up year (lower proportionsduring subsequent years) and if they had estrogen receptor/progesteronereceptor-negative tumors.CONCLUSIONS: Locoregional breast cancer patients undergo asymptomatic systemicimaging during follow-up despite guidelines recommending against it, but at lowerrates than previously reported. Providers appear to use factors that conferincreased recurrence risk to tailor decisions about systemic surveillanceimaging, perhaps reflecting limitations of data on which current guidelines arebased.
