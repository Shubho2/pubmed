However, a significant hospital variation existsin the use of IBR due to various reasons. To better understand this variation,the present study investigated preoperative information provision to patients andpersonal opinions of surgical oncologists and plastic surgeons towards potential contra-indications for IBR.METHODS: An online survey (35 questions) was developed including questions onrespondent demographics, information provision to the patient about IBR andpotential contra-indications by IBR technique.RESULTS: One-hundred-eighty-nine physicians participated: 118 surgicaloncologists and 71 plastic surgeons. All clinicians discussed the possibility of IBR with their patients. Complications (79% versus 100%, P < 0.001) and aestheticoutcomes (83% versus 99%, P = 0.001) were discussed less frequently by surgicaloncologists than by plastic surgeons.Patient age >75 years, breast size >D-cup,BMI >40 kg/m, smoking (for implant reconstruction), pulmonary/cardiaccomorbidities (for autologous reconstruction) and radiotherapy were considered a contra-indication more frequently by plastic surgeons. In contrast, surgicaloncologists reported tumor stage (≥cT3), nodal stage (≥cN2) and chemotherapy morefrequently to be a contra-indication for IBR.CONCLUSION: We observed that all respondents discussed the possibility of IBRwith their patients, whereas patient-tailored information was given morefrequently by plastic surgeons. Physicians differed in their opinions towardscontra-indications for IBR, with plastic surgeons reporting patient-related risk factors for wound healing problems and surgical oncologists reporting oncologicalcontra-indications more frequently. Consensus between physicians regardingcontra-indications for IBR may optimize patient counseling and shareddecision-making.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001572 PMID: 30067531
