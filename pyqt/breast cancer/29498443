Epub 2018 Mar 2.Outcomes of "one-day" vs "two-day" injection protocols using Tc-99m tilmanoceptfor sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer.Unkart JT(1), Proudfoot J(2), Wallace AM(1).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Moores Cancer Center, University of California, SanDiego, CA, USA.(2)Biostatistics Unit, Altman Clinical Translational Research Institute,University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.No prior studies have compared Tc-99m tilmanocept (TcTM) one-day and two-dayinjection protocols for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer (BC).We retrospectively identified patients with clinically node-negative BCundergoing SLN biopsy at our institution. Patients received a single, intradermalperitumoral injection of TcTM on day of surgery or day prior to surgery inaddition to an intraoperative injection of isosulfan blue dye. Univariable andmultivariable Poisson regression count models were constructed to assess theeffects of injection timing, radiologist, patient and surgeon characteristics on the number of removed SLNs. A total of 617 patients underwent SLN biopsy withTcTM and blue dye. Sixty-seven (10.9%) patients were injected with the two-dayprotocol. Patients in the one-day protocol had a mean of 3.0 (standard deviation (SD) 1.9) SLNs removed compared with 2.7 (SD 1.4) SLNs in the two-day protocol,P-value = .13. On multivariable analysis, patient age and operating surgeonsignificantly affected the number of removed SLNs; however, the injection timing and the nuclear radiologist did not influence the number of removed SLNs. Theperformance of Tc-99m tilmanocept did not differ significantly between one-dayand two-day injection protocols. These results are similar to other radiotracers used for SLN biopsy in BC.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13002 PMCID: PMC6043364 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29498443
