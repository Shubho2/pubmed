However, rare papers focused on the dynamic of drug in the core of micelles. In thispaper, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique toinvestigate the dynamic diffusion of drug from polymeric micelles. mPEG-PCLdiblock copolymers were used as carriers. A pair of fluorescence molecules Cy3and Cy5 was selected to evoke the FRET phenomenon. Cy5 was immobilized on theterminal group of PCL segments, Cy3 was encapsulated in the Cy5 modifiedpolymeric micelles as the model drug. The drug loaded polymeric micelles wereincubated with 4T1 breast cancer cells. The FRET was observed to explore thedynamic of Cy3 in the micelles. The results showed that the Cy3 loaded micelleswere stable in aqueous solution as the energy-transfer efficiency (ETE,I660/I565) rarely decreased even when the time was as long as 120 h. The ETEincreased with the content of encapsulated Cy3. The FRET spectra showed that the ETE of the Cy3 loaded polymeric micelles lowered with the release of Cy3 in PBS. The intracellular tracking of the Cy3 loaded micelles found more than 60% loaded drug was release within 12 h with the calculation of ETE in FRET spectra and itwas same to confocal laser scanning and flow cytometry results.DOI: 10.1166/jbn.2018.2585 PMID: 29944104
