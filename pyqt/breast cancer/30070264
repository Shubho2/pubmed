In parallel, this calls for noveltechnologies to assess cell growth in 3D cell culture. In this study, wedemonstrated both in silico and in vitro that cell viability inside large cellspheroids could be monitored in real time and label-free with electricalimpedance tomography (EIT). Simulations using a single shell model and theeffective media approximation (EMA) method were performed to prove theperformance of EIT on spheroid imaging and viability monitoring. Then in vitroexperiments were conducted to measure in real time a loss of cell viability inMCF-7 breast cancer spheroids when exposed to Triton X-100 and validate withconventional biochemical assays. It is shown that EIT has a spatial resolution of1.14% and it could monitor the cell mortality over 20% of a spheroid underlaboratory noise level. The reconstructed conductivity images for cell mortality induced by the chemical are clear and match the result in the cellular metabolic viability assay. Furthermore, the image reconstruction speed in the experimentwas less than 0.3 seconds. Taken together, the results show the potential of EIT for non-destructive real-time and label-free cellular assays in the miniaturesensor, providing physiological information in the applications of 3D drugscreening and tissue engineering.DOI: 10.1039/c8an00729b PMID: 30070264
