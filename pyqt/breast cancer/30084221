[Epub ahead of print]The effect of organized breast cancer screening on mammography use: Evidence fromFrance.Buchmueller TC(1)(2), Goldzahl L(3)(4).Author information: (1)Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.(2)NBER, Cambridge, Massachusetts.(3)Manchester Centre for Health Economics, School of Health Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.(4)EDHEC Business School, Roubaix, France.In 2004, France introduced a national program of organized breast cancerscreening. The national program built on preexisting local programs in some, but not all, départements. Using data from multiple waves of a nationallyrepresentative biennial survey of the French population, we estimate the effectof organized screening on the percentage of women obtaining a mammogram. Theanalysis uses difference-in-differences methods to exploit the fact that theprogram was targeted at women in a specific age group: 50 to 74 years old. Wefind that organized screening significantly raised mammography rates among women in the target age range. Just above the lower age threshold, the percentage ofwomen reporting that they had a mammogram in the past 2 years increased by over10 percentage points after the national program went into effect. Mammographyrates increased even more among women in their 60s. Estimated effects areparticularly large for women with less education and lower incomes, suggestingthat France's organized screening program has reduced socioeconomic disparitiesin access to mammography.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/hec.3813 PMID: 30084221
