Certain patients withadvanced extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) have also been reported to expressHER2, which is therefore considered a therapeutic target for EMPD. However, anaccurate methodology to determine HER2-positive EMPD has not been established. Toassess the optimal methods for detection of HER2-positive EMPD, 73 EMPD sampleswere analyzed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, fluorescence in situhybridization (FISH), and the HER2 testing algorithm for breast cancer of theAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists, whichcombined the results of IHC staining and FISH. The results showed discordance in the rate of positive IHC staining and FISH results. While 68.6% (24/35) of themetastatic samples showed equivocal or positive IHC staining, only 37.1% (13/35) were positive by FISH. To assess the accuracy of these methods, the degree ofHER2 expression detected by each method was correlated with the staining profilesof activated downstream signaling pathways involving phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK(Thr202/Tyr204) (p-ERK1/2) and phosphorylated AKT (Ser473) (p-AKT). Among 16lymph node metastasis samples, all HER2-positive samples as determined by thetesting algorithm stained positively for both p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT. On the otherhand, 10-14.3% of the samples determined by FISH or IHC showed negative staining for p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT. The results showed that combining the results of IHC and FISH according to the HER2 testing algorithm is a useful method for accuratelyevaluating HER2-positive EMPD.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1154-z PMID: 29744813
