The clinical spectrum of the disease isbroad and can mimic benign conditions. The diagnosis depends on thorough clinicalexamination and complementary exams, with emphasis on the histopathological studyand immunohistochemistry. Because it indicates a systemic relapse, it isnecessary to intervene with intravenous chemotherapy, to which local therapiescan be associated. We report the case of a 65-year-old woman with cutaneousmetastasis from breast cancer treated 14 years back, manifested by extensive firmand infiltrated red-purple plaques on the sides of the trunk, with a course ofsix months. After evaluation, she was referred to the regional cancer center. Shepassed away one month and a half later.DOI: 10.1590/abd1806-4841.20187157 PMCID: PMC6001113PMID: 29924228  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
