Treatment with T-025reduced CLK-dependent phosphorylation, resulting in the induction of skippedexons, cell death, and growth suppression in vitro and in vivo Further, throughgrowth inhibitory characterization, we identified high CLK2 expression or MYCamplification as a sensitive-associated biomarker of T-025. Mechanistically, the level of CLK2 expression correlated with the magnitude of global skipped exons inresponse to T-025 treatment. MYC activation, which altered pre-mRNA splicingwithout the transcriptional regulation of CLKs, rendered cancer cells vulnerable to CLK inhibitors with synergistic cell death. Finally, we demonstrated in vivoanti-tumor efficacy of T-025 in an allograft model of spontaneous, MYC-drivenbreast cancer, at well-tolerated dosage. Collectively, our results suggest thatthe novel CLK inhibitor could have therapeutic benefits, especially forMYC-driven cancer patients.© 2018 Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0license.DOI: 10.15252/emmm.201708289 PMCID: PMC5991599PMID: 29769258
