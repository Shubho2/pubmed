First, VDR genetic polymorphisms were compared in patients with and withoutcancer. Second, a network meta-analysis was used to reveal the relation betweenVDR genetic polymorphisms with disease outcomes. Subgroup analyses and ameta-regression were performed according to cancer types, ethnicity and genotypicmethod. The study is registered in PROSPERO with an ID: CRD42017075505.RESULTS: Forty-five studies were eligible, which included 65,754 patients and 55 clinical analyses. Of genetic models, results suggested that the recessive model with the CDX2 polymorphism predicted the risk of BC in all cases. The recessivepolymorphism model with the rs2228570 (FokI) polymorphism seemed to the bestpredictor of BC in Caucasian patients, whereas the homozygote model with the CDX2polymorphism appeared to best predict BC in African-American patients. Thehomozygote model with the rs2228570 (FokI) polymorphism model appeared to detect the risk of OC in all cases, whereas the heterozygote model with the rs1544410(BsmI) polymorphism seemed to detect the risk of OC in Caucasian patients.CONCLUSIONS: By detecting the risk of BC, the recessive model with the rs2228570 (FokI) polymorphism is likely the best genetic model in Caucasian patients, andthe homozygote model with the CDX2 polymorphism appears to be best genetic model in African-American patients. Moreover, for detecting clinical risk of OC,heterozygote models with the rs1544410 (BsmI) polymorphism is likely the bestgenetic model for detecting the risk of OC in Caucasian patients.Copyright Â© 2018.
