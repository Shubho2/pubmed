Mental health counseling before breast cancerdiagnosis and anxious preoccupation following cancer diagnosis were associatedwith reduced resilience (coefficient: -2.50; 95% CI: -3.83 to -1.18; and -0.46;95% CI: -0.60 to -0.32). Although sexual orientation was not independentlyassociated with resilience, among SMW, those who were unemployed had reducedresilience compared with those who were employed (coefficient: -3.52; 95% CI:-5.75 to -1.28), whereas there was no association between employment andresilience among heterosexual women.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that social support and other factorsassociated with resilience could be leveraged by interventions to improve thehealth and wellbeing of diverse cancer survivors.DOI: 10.1089/lgbt.2018.0019 PMID: 29878863
