So far, PSMA expression inbreast cancer endothelia has not been sufficiently characterized.METHODS: This study comprised 315 cases of invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) and lobular breast cancer (median follow-up time 9.0 years). PSMAexpression on tumor endothelia was detected by immunohistochemistry. Further,vascular mRNA expression of the FOLH1 gene (PSMA) was investigated in a cohort ofpatients with invasive breast cancer provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).RESULTS: Sixty percent of breast cancer cases exhibited PSMA-positive endothelia with higher expression rates in tumors of higher grade, NST subtype withHer2-positivity, and lack of hormone receptors. These findings were confirmed on mRNA expression levels. The highest PSMA rates were observed in triple-negativecarcinomas (4.5 × higher than in other tumors). Further, a case of a patient withmetastatic breast cancer showing PSMA expression in PET/CT imaging and undergoingPSMA radionuclide therapy is discussed in detail.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a rationale for the further development ofPSMA-targeted imaging in breast cancer, especially in triple-negative tumors.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4717-y PMID: 29455299
