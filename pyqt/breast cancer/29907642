Normal adult stem cells have thelongest telomeres in a given tissue, a property mediated by high hTERT expressionand high telomerase enzymatic activity. In contrast, cancer stem cells (CSCs)have short telomeres despite high expression of hTERT, indicating that the roleof hTERT in CSCs is not limited to telomere elongation and/or maintenance. Thefunction of hTERT in CSCs remains poorly understood. Here, we knocked down hTERT expression in CSCs and observed a morphological shift to a more epithelialphenotype, suggesting a role for hTERT in the epithelial-to-mesenchymaltransition (EMT) of CSCs. Therefore, in this study, we systematically exploredthe relationship between hTERT and EMT and identified a reciprocal,bi-directional feedback loop between hTERT and EMT in CSCs. We found that hTERTexpression is mutually exclusive to the mesenchymal phenotype and that,reciprocally, loss of the mesenchymal phenotype represses hTERT expression. Wealso showed that hTERT plays a critical role in the expression of key CSC markersand nuclear β-catenin localization, increases the percentage of cells withside-population properties, and upregulates the CD133 expression. hTERT alsopromotes chemoresistance properties, tumorsphere formation and other importantfunctional CSC properties. Subsequently, hTERT knockdown leads to the loss of theabove advantages, indicating a loss of CSC properties. Our findings suggest that targeting hTERT might improve CSCs elimination by transitioning them from theaggressive mesenchymal state to a more steady epithelial state, therebypreventing cancer progression.© 2018.
