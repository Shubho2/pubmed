Tumourfeatures at MRI (mass or non-mass lesion, diameter, lesion-NAC distance [LND])and pathology (lesion diameter, histopathological type, receptor status) wererecorded, as well as the type of surgery (NSM/SSM) and presence (NAC+) or absence(NAC-) of tumour at intraoperative evaluation of retroareolar tissue.Mann-Whitney test, Fisher's exact test, logistic regression, and receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for analysis of NAC+versus NAC- to assess variables that predict NAC tumoural involvement.RESULTS: Over the study period, NAC+ was proven histologically in 71/200 (35.5%) surgical treatments, while there were 129/200 NAC- (72 NSM and 128 SSMperformed). LND at MRI was statistically (p<0.001) lower in NAC+ patients than inNAC- patients. The area under the ROC curve (0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76-0.88) indicated 10 mm as the best cut-off, with sensitivity of 82%,specificity of 72%, and accuracy of 79%. A 5-mm cut-off enhanced sensitivity,whereas a 15-mm cut-off favoured specificity.CONCLUSIONS: MRI is a useful tool for identifying NAC+ patients; a 10-mm cut-off for LND assists selection of patients for NSM, although intraoperativeretroareolar tissue examination remains mandatory.Copyright © 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
