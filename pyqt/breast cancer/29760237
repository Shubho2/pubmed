To search for small molecule inhibitors of AP-2γ, we performed a high-throughput fluorescence anisotropy screen and identified a polyoxometalatecompound with Wells-Dawson structure K6[P2Mo18O62] (Dawson-POM) that blocks theDNA-binding activity of AP-2γ. We showed that this blocking activity is due tothe direct binding of Dawson-POM to AP-2γ. We also provided evidence to show thatDawson-POM decreases AP-2γ-dependent transcription similar to silencing the gene.Finally, we demonstrated that Dawson-POM contains anti-proliferative andpro-apoptotic effects in breast cancer cells. In summary, we identified the firstsmall molecule inhibitor of AP-2γ and showed Dawson-POM-mediated inhibition ofAP-2γ as a potential avenue for cancer therapy.© 2018 The Author(s).
