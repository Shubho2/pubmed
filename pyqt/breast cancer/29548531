This study evaluates the outcomes and complications associated with oncoplastic reduction mammaplasty performed by surgical breast oncologists.METHODS: A single institution retrospective chart review of patients undergoingoncoplastic reduction mammaplasty by a surgical breast oncologist for thetreatment of breast cancer.RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were identified. The average patient age was 59.6years (range 37-77 years). Average lesion span was 31.4 mm (range 3-166 mm). Six (8.5%) patients required additional surgery to obtain adequate margins. One(1.4%) patient developed recurrent disease during the follow-up interval. Nomajor surgical complications were observed.CONCLUSION: Oncoplastic reduction mammaplasty is associated with low rates ofre-excision and complications and can be safely and effectively performed byappropriately trained surgical breast oncologists.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
