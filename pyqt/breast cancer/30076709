[Epub ahead of print]Ferritinophagy/ferroptosis: Iron-related newcomers in human diseases.Tang M(1), Chen Z(1), Wu D(1), Chen L(1).Author information: (1)Institute of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Learning Key Laboratory forPharmacoproteomics, Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for MolecularTarget New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, China.Nuclear receptor coactivator 4 mediated ferritinophagy is an autophagicphenomenon that specifically involves ferritin to release intracellular freeiron. Ferritinophagy is implicated in maintaining efficient erythropoiesis.Notably, ferritinophagy also plays a central role in driving some pathologicalprocesses, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and urinary tract infections. Some evidence has demonstrated that ferritinophagy is critical to induce ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a newly nonapoptotic form of cell death, characterized by theaccumulation of iron-based lipid reactive oxygen species. Ferroptosis plays animportant role in inhibiting some types of cancers, such as hepatocellularcarcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. Conversely, the activation of ferroptosis accelerates neurodegeneration diseases,including PD and Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, in this review, we summarize theregulatory mechanisms related to ferritinophagy and ferroptosis. Moreover, thedistinctive effects of ferritinophagy in human erythropoiesis and somepathologies, coupled with the promotive or inhibitory role of tumorous andneurodegenerative diseases mediated by ferroptosis, are elucidated. Obviously,activating or inhibiting ferroptosis could be exploited to achieve desirabletherapeutic effects on diverse cancers and neurodegeneration diseases.Interrupting ferritinophagy to control iron level might provide a potentiallytherapeutic avenue to suppress urinary tract infections.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcp.26954 PMID: 30076709
