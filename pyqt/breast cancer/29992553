[Epub ahead of print]Breast cancer in women living with HIV: A first global estimate.McCormack V(1), Febvey-Combes O(1), Ginsburg O(2), Dos-Santos-Silva I(3).Author information: (1)Section of Environment and Radiation, International Agency for Research onCancer, Lyon, France.(2)NYU Langone Medical Centre, New York, United States.(3)London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.There is a growing population of older women living with HIV/AIDS (WLWHA). Breastcancer is a common cancer in women worldwide, but the global number of breastcancers in WLWHA is not known. We estimated, for each UN sub-region, the numberand age distribution of WLWHA who were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, bycombining IARC-GLOBOCAN estimates of age-country specific breast cancer incidencewith corresponding UNAIDS HIV prevalence. Primary analyses assumed no HIV-breast cancer association, and a breast cancer risk reduction scenario was alsoconsidered. Amongst 16.0 million WLWHA aged 15+ years, an estimated 6325 WLWHAwere diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, 74% of whom were in sub-SaharanAfrica, equally distributed between Eastern, Southern and Western Africa. In mostareas, 70% of HIV-positive breast cancers were diagnosed under age 50. Among all breast cancers (regardless of HIV status), HIV-positive women constituted <1% of the clinical burden, except in Eastern, Western and Middle Africa where theycomprised 4 to 6% of under age 50 year old breast cancer patients, and inSouthern Africa where this patient subgroup constituted 26% and 8% of breastcancers diagnosed under and over age 50 respectively. If a deficit of breastcancer occurs in WLWHA, the global estimate would reduce to 3600. In conclusion, worldwide, the number of HIV-positive women diagnosed with breast cancer wasalready substantial in 2012 and with an expected increase within the next decade,early detection and treatment research targeted to this population are needed.This article is protected by copyright.
