Electronic address:fmartel@med.up.pt.This work aimed to investigate the effect of metformin on cellular glucose uptakeand metabolism by breast cancer cells, as a mechanism contributing to itsanticancer properties. Estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive (MCF-7) andtriple-negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell lines were used as in vitromodels of breast cancer. Short-term (26 min) exposure of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cells to metformin inhibited uptake of 3H-deoxy-D-glucose (3H-DG). In contrast,long-term (24 h) exposure to metformin (5 μM-1 mM) concentration-dependentlyincreased 3H-DG uptake in both cell lines. This effect was associated with anincrease in lactate production but was not associated with changes in GLUT1 mRNA expression. Long-term exposure of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells to metformin(5 μM-1 mM) concentration-dependently reduced cell viability and culture mass andslightly increased cell proliferation rates. Combination of metformin (1 mM) withthe facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitor kaempferol (30 μM) did not change the effect of metformin on culture growth. In conclusion, short-termexposure to metformin reduces cellular glucose uptake, probably by directinhibition of GLUT1. However, after long-term exposure to metformin, cellularuptake of glucose is significantly increased, not associated to changes in GLUT1 transcription rates. We suggest that, in the long-term, metformin induces acompensatory increase in glucose uptake in response to cellular energy depletion resulting from its inhibitory effect on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylationmachinery. Metformin-induced dependence of breast cancer cells on glycolyticpathway, associated with an anticarcinogenic effect of the drug, provides abiochemical basis for the design of new therapeutic strategies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
