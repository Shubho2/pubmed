However, clinical responses to drugs targeting this pathway have been modest, possibly because of dynamic changes in cellular signaling that driveresistance and limit drug efficacy. Using a quantitative chemoproteomicsapproach, we mapped kinome dynamics in response to inhibitors of this pathway andidentified signaling changes that correlate with drug sensitivity. Maintenance ofAURKA after drug treatment was associated with resistance in breast cancermodels. Incomplete inhibition of AURKA was a common source of therapy failure,and combinations of PI3K, AKT or mTOR inhibitors with the AURKA inhibitor MLN8237were highly synergistic and durably suppressed mTOR signaling, resulting inapoptosis and tumor regression in vivo. This signaling map identifies survivalfactors whose presence limits the efficacy of targeted therapies and reveals new drug combinations that may unlock the full potential of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathwayinhibitors in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41589-018-0081-9 PMCID: PMC6051919 [Available on 2018-12-25]PMID: 29942081
