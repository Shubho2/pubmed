Electronic address:smriti_bhadauria@cdri.res.in.Oncostatin M (OSM), an inflammatory cytokine belonging to the interleukin-6(IL-6) superfamily, plays a vital role in multitude of physiological andpathological processes. Its role in breast tumor progression and metastasis todistant organs is well documented. Recent reports implicate OSM in macrophage M2 polarization, a key pro-tumoral phenomenon. M2 polarization of macrophages isbelieved to promote tumor progression by potentiating metastasis andangiogenesis. In the current study, we delineated the mechanism underlying OSMinduced macrophage M2 polarization. The findings revealed that OSM skewsmacrophages towards an M2 polarized phenotype via mTOR signaling complex 2(mTORC2). mTORC2 relays signals through two effector kinases i.e. PKC-α and Akt. Our results indicated that mTORC2 mediated M2 polarization of macrophages is not dependent on PKC-α and is primarily affected via Akt, particularly Akt1. In vivo studies conducted on 4T1/BALB/c mouse orthotropic model of breast cancer further corroborated these observations wherein i.v. reintroduction of mTORC2 abrogatedmonocytes into orthotropic mouse model resulted in diminished acquisition of M2specific attributes by tumor associated macrophages. Metastasis to distant organslike lung, liver and bone was reduced as evident by decrease in formation offocal metastatic lesions in mTORC2 abrogated monocytes mice. Our study pinpoints key role of mTORC2-Akt1 axis in OSM induced macrophage polarization and suggests for possible usage of Oncostatin-M blockade and/or selective mTORC2 inhibition asa potential anti-cancer strategy particularly with reference to metastasis ofbreast cancer to distant organs such as lung, liver and bone.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
