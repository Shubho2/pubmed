However, the lowerand variable concentrations of CYP activity at the tumor remain major bottlenecksfor the efficient treatment, causing severe side-effects. Combination nanotherapyhas gained much recent attention for cancer treatment as it reduces thedrug-associated toxicity without affecting the therapeutic response.RESULTS: Here we show the modular design of P22 bacteriophage virus-likeparticles for nanoscale integration of virus-driven enzyme prodrug therapy andphotodynamic therapy. These virus capsids carrying CYP activity at the core aredecorated with photosensitizer and targeting moiety at the surface for effective combinatory treatment. The estradiol-functionalized nanoparticles are recognized and internalized into ER+ breast tumor cells increasing the intracellular CYPactivity and showing the ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) uponUV365 nm irradiation. The generated ROS in synergy with enzymatic activitydrastically enhanced the tamoxifen sensitivity in vitro, strongly inhibitingtumor cells.CONCLUSIONS: This work clearly demonstrated that the targeted combinatorytreatment using multifunctional biocatalytic P22 represents the effectivenanotherapeutics for ER+ breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12951-018-0345-2 PMCID: PMC5819296PMID: 29463260
