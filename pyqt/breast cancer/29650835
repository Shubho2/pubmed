Gan To Kagaku Ryoho. 2018 Apr;45(4):685-687.[Diagnosis of a Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Assisted by Long-Term Follow-Up ofSpontaneous Nipple Discharge - A Case Report].[Article in Japanese]Hirano T(1), Suzuki S, Adachi K, Kubota H, Hara Y, Enomoto K, Tomita R, Fujisaki S, Sakurai K.Author information: (1)Division of Breast and Endocrine Surgery, Dept. of Surgery, Nihon UniversitySchool of Medicine.We report a case of a non-invasive ductal carcinoma revealed on long-termfollow-up of spontaneous nipple discharge. The patient, a 36-year-old woman, had noticed spontaneous nipple discharge from both breasts over a 3-year period.Mammography and ultrasonography did not reveal any lesions in the breasts. Thenipple discharge from her left breast stopped 36 months after initial clinicalassessment. However, the nipple discharges from her right breast transformed intoa bloody discharge from a single duct. Ultrasonography showed a tumor, 6mm indiameter, in the upper-outer quadrant of her right breast. A core needle biopsyfor breast tumor led to a pathological diagnosis of non-invasive ductalcarcinoma. We conducted a whole-body clinical examination but no metastaticlesions were detected. Subsequently, we performed breastconserving surgery andsentinel lymph node biopsy. The pathological diagnosis was non-invasive ductalcarcinoma in situ. The tumor was positive for estrogen and progesteronereceptors, but negative for HER2/neu. The Ki-67 labeling index was 5%. Thesurgical margin was negative. We diagnosed the tumor as TisN0M0=Stage 0.Endocrine therapy comprising tamoxifen (20mg/day)was initiated. Four years after surgery, she was well without any metastases.PMID: 29650835  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
