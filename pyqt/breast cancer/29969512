The aim of this study was to investigate the uptake and transport mechanism of DMY in human intestinalCaco-2 cells. DMY was detected using a liquid chromatography-tandem massspectrometry method. Several factors including time, concentration, pH,temperature and efflux transporters were systematically evaluated. DMY was poorlyabsorbed by a passive diffusion mechanism. The uptake and transport of DMY weretime and concentration dependent. Interestingly, decreasing the pH from 8.0 to6.0 markedly enhanced the DMY uptake, but didn't significantly affect itsbidirectional transport. Efflux transporters, multidrug resistance protein 2 and breast cancer resistance protein also influenced the DMY uptake and transportprocesses. This work details the uptake and transport characteristics of DMY and provides basis for future study.PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study elucidated the uptake and transport characteristics of dihydromyricetin (DMY). DMY was poorlyabsorbed by a passive diffusion mechanism. The uptake and transport of DMY weretime and concentration dependent. Interestingly, pH affected DMY uptake but notits bidirectional transport. MRP2 and BCRP were involved in the uptake andtransport of DMY, which hindered the absorption of DMY in the intestinal. Thus,the present study may provide useful information for designing DMY deliverysystems and avoiding DMY-drug interactions.© 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®.DOI: 10.1111/1750-3841.14112 PMID: 29969512
