Ion channels are key players in interactions between tumor cells and TM. Kv10.1 has been shown to play anessential role in breast cancer cell proliferation and migration by permittingCa2+ influx notably via Orai1. Here, we show that human breast cancer (BC) cells growing, in culture media completely devoid of the serum and seeded on collagen 1coating, exhibited less apoptotic rate and a decrease in Bax expression whencompared to those grown on plastic. The survival conferred by collagen 1 wascompletely abolished by removing extracellular Ca2+ from the culture medium. Inaddition, Ca2+ entry was increased in collagen 1 condition along with increasedKv10.1 and Orai1 expressions. Moreover, collagen 1 was able to increaseco-localization of Kv10.1 and Orai1 on the plasma membrane. Interestingly,silencing of Kv10.1 and Orai1 reduced survival and Ca2+influx without anyadditive effect. This calcium-dependent survival is accompanied by the activationof ERK1/2, and its pharmacological inhibition completely abolished the increasein Kv10.1 and Orai1 expressions, activities, and the cell survival induced bycollagen 1. Moreover, both Kv10.1 and Orai1 knockdown reduced ERK1/2 activationbut not Akt. Finally, DDR1 silencing but not Î²1-integrin reduced the collageninduced survival, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the expression of Kv10.1 and Orai1. Together these data show that the Kv10.1/Orai1 complex is involved in BC cellsurvival and this is dependent on collagen 1/DDR1 pathway. Therefore, theyrepresent a checkpoint of tumor progression induced by the tumormicroenvironment.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.19065 PMCID: PMC5973854PMID: 29872495
