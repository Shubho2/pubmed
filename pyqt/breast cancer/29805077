Electronic address: joan_brugge@hms.harvard.edu.Cancer cell survival is dependent on oxidative-stress defenses against reactiveoxygen species (ROS) that accumulate during tumorigenesis. Here, we show anon-canonical oxidative-stress defense mechanism through TRPA1, a neuronalredox-sensing Ca2+-influx channel. In TRPA1-enriched breast and lung cancerspheroids, TRPA1 is critical for survival of inner cells that exhibit ROSaccumulation. Moreover, TRPA1 promotes resistance to ROS-producingchemotherapies, and TRPA1 inhibition suppresses xenograft tumor growth andenhances chemosensitivity. TRPA1 does not affect redox status but upregulatesCa2+-dependent anti-apoptotic pathways. NRF2, an oxidant-defense transcriptionfactor, directly controls TRPA1 expression, thus providing an orthogonalmechanism for protection against oxidative stress together with canonicalROS-neutralizing mechanisms. These findings reveal an oxidative-stress defenseprogram involving TRPA1 that could be exploited for targeted cancer therapies.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
