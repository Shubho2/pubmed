In fact, enhanced mitochondrialbiogenesis and impaired quality control are frequently observed in cancer cells. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes 13 subunits of oxidative phosphorylation(OXPHOS), is present in thousands of copies per cell, and has a very highmutation rate. Mutations in mtDNA and nuclear DNA (nDNA) genes encoding proteins that are important players in mitochondrial biogenesis and function are involved in oncogenic processes. A wide range of germline mtDNA polymorphisms, as well as tumor mtDNA somatic mutations have been identified in diverse cancer types.Approximately 72% of supposed tumor-specific somatic mtDNA mutations reported,have also been found as polymorphisms in the general population. The ATPase 6 andNADH dehydrogenase subunit genes of mtDNA are the most commonly mutated genes in breast cancer (BC). Furthermore, nuclear genes playing a role in mitochondrialbiogenesis and function, such as peroxisome proliferators-activated receptorgamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1), fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinatedehydrogenase (SDH) are frequently mutated in cancer. In this review, we provide an overview of the mitochondrial germline variants and mutations in cancer, with particular focus on those found in BC.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4468 PMID: 30015870
