[Epub aheadof print]Screening status, tumour subtype, and breast cancer survival: a nationalpopulation-based analysis.O'Brien KM(1)(2), Mooney T(3), Fitzpatrick P(3)(4), Sharp L(5).Author information: (1)National Cancer Registry Ireland, Cork, T12 CDF7, Ireland. k.obrien@ncri.ie.(2)Department of Mathematics, Cork Institute of Technology, Cork, T12 P928,Ireland. k.obrien@ncri.ie.(3)National Screening Service, King's Inns House, 200 Parnell Street, Dublin 1,Ireland.(4)School of Public Health, Physiotherapy & Sports Science, University CollegeDublin, Dublin 4, Ireland.(5)Institute of Health & Society, Newcastle University, Richardson Road,Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4AX, UK.PURPOSE: We examined whether demographic and tumour characteristics (includingsubtype) were different for women with breast cancer diagnosed via mammographyscreening compared with women with interval breast cancers, lapsed attenders ofthe screening programme and non-participants of the screening programme. Inaddition, we explored whether there were survival differences between the groups,taking into account lead time bias.METHODS: We used linked data from National Cancer Registry Ireland and thenational breast screening programme BreastCheck. Multinomial logistic regression was used to test the association of covariates with screening status. Forsurvival analysis, we corrected the survival time for screen-detected cases forlead time bias, examined Kaplan-Meier curves and then used Cox regression toinvestigate differences in survival by screening status.RESULTS: Subtype (HER2 over-expressing, triple negative), stage (III/IV), grade(poor), having co-morbidities, area of deprivation, smoking status and age wereassociated with having interval cancer or being a non-participant of thescreening programme in the multivariable model. After correcting for lead timebias, and adjusting for variables associated with screening status, there was no evidence that risk of breast-cancer death for women with screen-detected cancerwas different from women with interval cancer (HR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.56-1.03),non-participants (HR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.84-1.37) and lapsed attenders (HR = 0.97,95% CI 0.65-1.45).CONCLUSIONS: Screening status was strongly associated with subtype and thisassociation persisted after adjustment for covariates including tumour stage and grade. After correcting for lead-time bias and adjusting for stage, subtype,grade and socio-demographic variables, no significant survival difference wasdemonstrated for women with screen-detected cancer in the 5-year periodpost-diagnosis. Since we are adjusting for stage, subtype and other variables,the lack of difference between these groups would be expected but has not beendemonstrated in studies which do not correct for lead time bias.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4877-9 PMID: 30006795
