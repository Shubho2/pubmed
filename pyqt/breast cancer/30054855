Worldwide, adjuvant denosumab at a dose of60 mg twice per year reduces the risk of clinical fractures in postmenopausalpatients with breast cancer who received AI. However, the efficacy of denosumabin the treatment of AI-associated bone loss had not been prospectively evaluated in Japan. Previously, we reported the 12-month effect of denosumab in Japanesepatients for the first time; the primary endpoint was the change in thepercentage of bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine from baseline to12 months.METHODS: This secondary follow-up study prospectively evaluated the change in thepercentage of BMD of the lumbar spine from baseline to 24 months. Postmenopausal women with early-stage, histologically confirmed, hormone receptor-positive,invasive breast cancer who were receiving or scheduled to receive AI wereincluded. Denosumab was administered subcutaneously on day 1 of the study andthen 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The lumbar spine and bilateral femoral neck BMDwas measured at baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.RESULTS: At 18 and 24 months, the lumbar spine BMD increased by 5.9 and 7.0%,respectively. The femoral neck BMD also increased. Grade ≥ 2 hypocalcemia,osteonecrosis of the jaw, and atypical femoral fractures did not occur.CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective study showed that semiannual treatment withdenosumab was associated with continuously increased BMD in Japanese womenreceiving adjuvant AI therapy for up to 24 months, regardless of prior AItreatment.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0896-y PMID: 30054855
