Triple-negativebreast cancer (TNBC) constitutes 15% of breast cancer and shows distinctmetastasis profiles with poor prognosis. Strong PD-L1 expression has beenobserved in some tumors, supporting their escape from immune surveillance.Targeting PD-L1 could be a promising therapeutic approach in breast cancerpatients. We investigated potential molecular mechanisms for constitutiveexpression of PD-L1 by inhibiting upstream STAT1 and STAT3 signals.METHODS: PD-L1 expression in three breast cancer cell lines was measured usingquantitative PCR and western blotting. Activation of STAT1 and STAT3 was blocked using pharmacological inhibitors and siRNA. The mechanism underlying theconstitutive expression of PD-L1 was investigated using ChIP andco-immunoprecipitation assays.RESULTS: We found that individual inhibition of STAT1 and STAT3 activationpartially downregulated PD-L1, while combined inhibition completely downregulatedPD-L1 expression. Moreover, our results suggest that pSTAT1-pSTAT3 dimerize incytosol and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to PD-L1 promoter andinduce PD-L1 expression.CONCLUSION: These findings provide a rationale for combined targeting of STAT1and STAT3 for the development of immune-based cancer therapies for downregulation of PD-L1 expression.DOI: 10.1080/14728222.2018.1471137 PMID: 29702007
