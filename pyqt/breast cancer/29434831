China.Accumulating data suggest that adipose tissue facilitates breast tumor initiationand progression through paracrine and endocrine pathways, and that adiposetissue-derived stem cell (ASC) is likely the major cell type responsible fortumorigenesis and tumor development. However, it remains unknown how ASCs exerttheir effects. In the present study, in cultured breast cancer cell lines,including estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, the effects on tumor proliferation of isolated ASCs from human breastswere examined. The expression of 174 cytokines was additionally identified inthis medium. With an anti-human C-X-C motif ligand 5 (CXCL5) monoclonal antibody,the effects of neutralization of CXCL5 on the actions of ASCs in a co-culturemedium of ASCs and tumor cells were studied The results demonstrated that ASCssignificantly increased the number of breast cancer cells compared with controls.Similarly, the co-culture medium of ASCs with breast cancer cells exhibitedpotent effects on tumor cell proliferation. In the co-culture medium of ASCs withbreast cancer cells, CXCL5 levels were significantly increased. In addition,depletion of CXCL5 with its specific antibody in ASC-conditioned medium blockedthe stimulatory effect of ASCs on the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Tothe best of our knowledge, these results indicate for the first time thatASC-secreted CXCL5 is a key factor promoting breast tumor cell proliferation.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7522 PMCID: PMC5777118PMID: 29434831
