The authors previously reported a nonsignificantassociation between TRAP and cancer risk in a relatively small cohort ofmyocardial infarction survivors. This study assessed whether TRAP exposure isassociated with subsequent cancer in a large cohort of coronary patients. Methods& results Consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions in a major medical centre in central Israel from 2004 to 2014 were followed forcancer through 2015. Residential levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) - a proxy forTRAP - were estimated based on a high-resolution national land use regressionmodel. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to study relationshipswith cancer. Among 12,784 candidate patients, 9816 had available exposure dataand no history of cancer (mean age, 68 years; 77% men). During a median(25th-75th percentiles) follow-up of 7.0 (3.9-9.3) years, 773 incident cases ofcancer (8%) were diagnosed. In a multivariable-adjusted model, a 10-ppb increase in mean NOx exposure was associated with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.07 (95%confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.15) for all-site cancer and 1.16 (95% CI1.05-1.28) for cancers previously linked to TRAP (lung, breast, prostate, kidney and bladder). A stronger association was observed for breast cancer (HR = 1.43;95% CI 1.12-1.83). Associations were slightly strengthened after limiting thecohort to patients with more precise exposure assessment. Conclusion Coronarypatients exposed to TRAP are at increased risk of several types of cancer,particularly lung, prostate and breast. As these cancers are amenable toprevention strategies, identifying highly exposed patients may provide anopportunity to improve clinical care.DOI: 10.1177/2047487318760892 PMID: 29482439
