Epub 2018 Jun 18.28-Noroleanane-derived spirocyclic triterpenoids and iridoid glucosides from the roots of Phlomoides umbrosa (Turcz.) Kamelin & Makhm with their cytotoxiceffects.Le DD(1), Nguyen DH(2), Zhao BT(3), Kim JA(4), Kim SK(5), Min BS(1), Choi JS(6), Woo MH(7).Author information: (1)Drug Research and Development Center, Daegu Catholic University, Gyeongsan,38430, Republic of Korea.(2)Drug Research and Development Center, Daegu Catholic University, Gyeongsan,38430, Republic of Korea; Phutho College of Pharmacy, Viettri City, PhuthoProvince, 290000, Viet Nam.(3)Drug Research and Development Center, Daegu Catholic University, Gyeongsan,38430, Republic of Korea; School of Chemical and Material Engineering, JiangnanUniversity, Wuxi, 214122, China.(4)College of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea.(5)School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, 38541,Republic of Korea.(6)Department of Food Science & Nutrition, Pukyong National University, Busan,48513, Republic of Korea.(7)Drug Research and Development Center, Daegu Catholic University, Gyeongsan,38430, Republic of Korea. Electronic address: woomh@cu.ac.kr.Four undescribed 23,24-O-isopropylidene-19(18 → 17)-abeo-28-noroleanane-derivedspirocyclic triterpenoids and an undescribed 28-noroleanane-derived spirocyclictriterpenoid, together with five known 28-noroleanane-derived spirocyclictriterpenoids, were isolated and identified. In addition, three undescribediridoid glucosides and four known ones were also identified. All the isolateswere identified using spectroscopic techniques, and the absolute configurationsof 28-noroleanane-derived spirocyclic triterpenoids were determined by CD method for the first time. Additionally, the alkaline hydrolysis method and HPLCanalysis were applied to confirm the moieties of the iridoid glucosides. Thefraction and isolates were evaluated for cytotoxic activity on cervical cancer(Hela), human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), and breast cancer (MCF-7) celllines. Among them, phlomisu E possessed an aldehyde group showed the most potent cytotoxic effect with IC50 value less than 10 μM.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
