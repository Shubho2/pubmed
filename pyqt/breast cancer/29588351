Here we demonstrate that the cytosolic lncRNA P53RRA is downregulated in cancers andfunctions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cancer progression. Chromatinremodeling proteins LSH and Cfp1 silenced or increased P53RRA expression,respectively. P53RRA bound Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1(G3BP1) using nucleotides 1 and 871 of P53RRA and the RRM interaction domain ofG3BP1 (aa 177-466). The cytosolic P53RRA-G3BP1 interaction displaced p53 from aG3BP1 complex, resulting in greater p53 retention in the nucleus, which led tocell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and ferroptosis. P53RRA promoted ferroptosis andapoptosis by affecting transcription of several metabolic genes. Low P53RRAexpression significantly correlated with poor survival in patients with breastand lung cancers harboring wild-type p53. These data show that lncRNAs candirectly interact with the functional domain of signaling proteins in thecytoplasm, thus regulating p53 modulators to suppress cancerprogression.Significance: A cytosolic lncRNA functions as a tumor suppressor byactivating the p53 pathway.
