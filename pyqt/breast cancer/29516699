Patients in the Moxi group were treated withthunder-fire moxibustion applied to the back part of body from Pishu (BL 20) toQihaishu (BL 24) on the bilateral sides and to the abdominal part from Zhongwan(CV 12) to Guanyuan (CV 4) for 30 min, once a day for 14 days. Patients in thenursing group were treated with health education and conventional nursing care.The simple fatigue scale, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome score,clinical curative effect were observed before and after the treatment, and white blood cell (WBC) count was observed 5 days ofter chemotherapy and after thetreatment respectively.RESULTS: After the treatment, the simple fatigue scales and TCM syndrome scoreswere significantly decreased and WBC counts were significantly increased in both groups relevant to their individual pre-treatment (P<0.01). The therapeuticeffect of the Moxi group was appa-rently superior to that of the nursing group inlowering the simple fatigue scale and TCM syndrome score and in up-regulating WBCcount (P<0.01, P<0.05). The total effective rate of the Moxi group wassignificantly higher than that of the nursing group (83.3%[25/30]vs 36.7%[11/30], P<0.01).CONCLUSION: Thunder-fire moxibustion can effectively relieve the degree offatigue and the symptoms of qi deficiency in breast cancer patients undergoingchemotherapy.PMID: 29516699
