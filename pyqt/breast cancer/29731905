China.WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) serves an important role in various biologicalfunctions through the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Aberrantexpression of WDR5 has been observed in various types of human cancer, including prostate cancer, breast cancer and leukemia. However, the role of WDR5 expressionand its clinical implications in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largelyunknown. The present study investigated the WDR5 expression pattern in HCC. Itwas demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of WDR5 were upregulated in HCCcancer tissues compared with normal adjacent tissues using reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting.Furthermore, the elevated WDR5 protein level was significantly associated withthe histological grade (P=0.038), tumor size (P=0.023), tumor-node-metastasisstage (P=0.035) and reduced long-term survival time. Additionally, it wasdemonstrated through the shRNA-mediated knockdown of WDR5 in HCC cells in vitrothat WDR5 expression promotes cell proliferation using an MTT assay. Takentogether, the results suggested that WDR5 overexpression may have an oncogeniceffect in HCC, and may be a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosisof HCC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8298 PMCID: PMC5921231PMID: 29731905
