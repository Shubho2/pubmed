Electronic address: vimararagu@gmail.com.The present study focuses on the development of a chitosan functionalizednanobiocomposite for the co-delivery of two anti-cancer drugs camptothecin (CPT) and 3,3'‑Diindolylmethane (DIM). The difference in the mechanism of action of thetwo drugs makes them a promising candidate to produce a synergistic effectagainst breast cancer. Herein a nanobiocomposite was developed by functionalizinga natural polymer chitosan to graphene oxide nanoparticles and decorated withfolic acid. The nanobiocomposite thus synthesized was loaded with camptothecinand 3,3'‑Diindolylmethane and characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD),Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy(SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-visible spectroscopy (UV) andatomic force microscopy (AFM).Biocompatibility was assayed by hemolysis andanti-inflammatory assay. The cellular toxicity was measured by3‑(4,5‑Dimethylthiazol‑2‑yl)‑2,5‑Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT),Sulforhodamine B (SRB) and cell death assay against MCF-7 cell lines. Further in vivo studies were carried out to analyze the biodistribution of the drug, bloodbiochemical analysis and bioavailability of the drug. The data revealed asignificant increase in anticancer activity after co-loading of CPT and DIM tothe nanocarrier. Also in-vivo studies revealed that DIM successfully masked thetoxic effects produced by CPT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.02.153 PMID: 29496437
