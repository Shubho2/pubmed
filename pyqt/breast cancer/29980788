However, the role ofepigenetic modification in driving the function of CAFs within breast tumors isonly marginally known. Herein, we reported that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6),one of class II histone deacetylases, was frequently upregulated in the CAFs ofbreast tumor and promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment. The genetic orpharmacologic disruption of HDAC6 in CAFs delays tumor growth, inhibits the tumorrecruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, altersthe macrophage phenotype switch, and increases the CD8+ and CD4+ T-cellactivation in vivo. Mechanistically, we identified prostaglandinE2/cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) as a major target of HDAC6 in CAFs by regulating STAT3activation. Overexpressing COX2 in HDAC6-knockdown CAFs can completely restorethe immunosuppressive properties of the fibroblasts. Clinically, a positivecorrelation among the stromal expression levels of HDAC6, p-STAT3, and COX2 inhuman breast cancer was observed. High-stromal expression of HDAC6 was markedlyassociated with poor survival outcome. Overall, our findings indicated thatfibroblastic HDAC6 was a vital epigenetic mediator involved in programming animmunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that dampens antitumor immunity. Thus,HDAC6 may be a good potential target to improve breast cancer immunotherapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0379-9 PMID: 29980788
