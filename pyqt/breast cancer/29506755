Leffall Jr., M.D. The Man and the Mission.Cornwell EE 3rd(1).Author information: (1)Howard University College of Medicine, USA; Howard University Hospital, USA.Electronic address: ecornwell@howard.edu.On March 19-20, 2017; Howard University hosted a Festschrift inspired by Dr.Leffall's writings (Fig. 1). The celebrants highlighted the broad spectrum of Dr.Leffall's contributions in mentorship, leadership in American Surgery, breastcancer, endocrine cancer, pancreatic cancer, and familial polyposis coli. Perhapsmost inspirational was the awe inspiring consistency the presenters demonstrated in describing the personal characteristics Dr. Leffall brings to his academicdiscourse: his encyclopedic knowledge and recall, his charm, eloquence, humility,and his total dedication to the patient, his students, and trainees. We aregreatly indebted to Kirby Bland M.D., FACS for offering the pages of The AmericanJournal of Surgery to illuminate this celebration.Copyright © 2017.
