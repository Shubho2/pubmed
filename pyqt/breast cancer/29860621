[Epub ahead of print]TERT promoter mutational screening as a tool to predict malignant behaviour infollicular thyroid tumours-three examples from the clinical routine.Hysek M(1), Paulsson JO(2), Wang N(2), Jatta K(1), Lindh C(1)(2),Fuentes-Martinez N(1), Shabo I(3)(4), Zedenius J(3)(4), Juhlin CC(5)(6).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Cytology, Karolinska University Hospital,Stockholm, Sweden.(2)Department of Oncology-Pathology, Cancer Centre Karolinska (CCK) R8:04,Karolinska Institutet, 17176, Stockholm, Sweden.(3)Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet,Stockholm, Sweden.(4)Department of Breast, Endocrine Tumors and Sarcoma, Karolinska UniversityHospital, Stockholm, Sweden.(5)Department of Pathology and Cytology, Karolinska University Hospital,Stockholm, Sweden. christofer.juhlin@ki.se.(6)Department of Oncology-Pathology, Cancer Centre Karolinska (CCK) R8:04,Karolinska Institutet, 17176, Stockholm, Sweden. christofer.juhlin@ki.se.Follicular thyroid adenomas (FTAs) and carcinomas (FTCs), collectively the mostcommon thyroid neoplasms, constitute a significant clinical challenge sincehistological evidence of invasive behaviour is required for a malignantdiagnosis. Small subsets of FTAs relapse as manifest malignant FTCs, indicatingthat histology is not always adequate to predict malignant potential. Lately,recurrent mutations in the promoter of the Telomerase reverse transcriptase(TERT) gene have been coupled to FTCs, whereas FTAs usually lack this aberrancy. We describe three patients with follicular thyroid tumours in which TERT promotermutational screening was employed as part of the clinical work-up to pinpointmalignant potential. In two retrospective analyses of seemingly benign lesions,the detected mutations predicted future skeletal metastases, and in oneprospective case, the mutational screening led to a different clinical managementof the afflicted patient. We therefore consider TERT promoter mutationalscreening an adjunct tool of value in equivocal cases.DOI: 10.1007/s00428-018-2386-1 PMID: 29860621
