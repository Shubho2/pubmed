The receptor is taken up byfibroblasts, where it is N-terminally processed to a shorter form (Mr = 36 kDa)that appears to be constitutively active and able to stimulate the extracellular signal regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK-1/2) pathway and DNA synthesis. An N-terminally truncated construct of S1P2, which may correspond to the processed form of thereceptor generated in fibroblasts, was found to be constitutively active whenover-expressed in HEK293 cells. Analysis based on the available crystal structureof the homologous S1P1 receptor suggests that, in the inactive-state, theN-terminus of S1P2 may tension TM1 so as to maintain a compressive action on TM7.This in turn may stabilise a closed basal state interface between theintracellular ends of TM7 and TM6. Cleavage and removal of the S1P2 N-terminalpeptide is postulated to facilitate relaxation of TM1 and accompanying separationof TM6 and TM7. The latter transition is one of the key elements of G proteinengagement and is required to open the intracellular coupling interface beneaththe GPCR helix bundle. Therefore, removal at the N-terminus of S1P2 is likely to enhance G protein coupling. These findings provide the first evidence that S1P2is released from breast cancer cells in exosomes and is processed by fibroblasts to promote ERK signaling and proliferation of these cells.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25658 PMCID: PMC6047680PMID: 30034630
