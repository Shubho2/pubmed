Pascale, ViaMariano Semmola, Naples, Italy.Background: We investigated the performance of optical imaging evaluatingdeoxyhemoglobin concentration alteration (DeHCA) in breast tissues.Methods: We enrolled all consecutive patients from January 2015 to October 2016with clinically suspicious and/or BI-RADS grade 3-5 lesions at mammography orultrasound (US). Patients underwent optical imaging (ComfortScan) to evaluate forDeHCA. The reference standard was pathology from a surgical specimen formalignant lesions, pathology from a surgical specimen or core needle biopsy forbenign lesions, and negative follow-up for contralateral negative breasts.Non-parametric statistics, receiver operating characteristic, and lineardiscrimination analyses were performed.Results: Of 334 enrolled patients, 168 (50%) were excluded for technical problemsand 166 (50%) (median age 52 years) were analyzed totaling 331 breasts and 176lesions. Of these, 75 were benign (median size 19 mm) and 101 malignant (mediansize 20 mm). The median DeHCA score in malignant lesions (0.95, interquartilerange [IQR] 1.00-0.87) was higher (p < 0.001) than in benign lesions (0.80, IQR0.95-0.70). Using the optimal cutoff (0.85), DeHCA score was less accurate thanmammography, US, and their combination, with 78% sensitivity, 52% specificity,40% positive predictive value (PPV), and 85% negative predictive value (NPV);using a 0.8 cutoff, sensitivity reached 93% and NPV 91%, but specificity fell to 32% and PPV to 37%. The accuracy of DeHCA score linearly combined withmammography or US was higher than that of DeHCA score alone (p < 0.001) and notsignificantly higher than that of mammography or US alone.Conclusions: DeHCA score was significantly higher in malignant than in benignlesions, but its accuracy was significantly lower than that of mammography or US.Future refinements are needed.DOI: 10.1186/s41747-018-0038-5 PMCID: PMC5911436PMID: 29708210
