Electronic address: amit.tiwari@utoledo.edu.A series of lH-pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinolin-3-amine derivatives were synthesized andevaluated for anticancer efficacy in a panel of ten cancer cell lines, including breast (MDAMB-231 and MCF-7), colon (HCT-116, HCT-15, HT-29 and LOVO), prostate(DU-145 and PC3), brain (LN-229), ovarian (A2780), and human embryonic kidney(HEK293) cells, a non-cancerous cell line. Among the eight derivatives screened, compound QTZ05 had the most potent and selective antitumor efficacy in the fourcolon cancer cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 2.3 to 10.2 µM.Furthermore, QTZ05 inhibited colony formation in HCT-116 cells in aconcentration-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis data indicated that QTZ05caused an arrest in the sub G1 cell cycle in HCT-116 cells. QTZ05 inducedapoptosis in HCT-116 cells in a concentration-dependent manner that wascharacterized by chromatin condensation and increase in the fluorescence offluorochrome-conjugated Annexin V. The findings from our study suggest that QTZ05may be a valuable prototype for the development of chemotherapeutics targetingapoptotic pathways in colorectal cancer cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
