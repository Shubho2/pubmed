[Epub ahead ofprint]A Radiomics Approach with CNN for Shear-wave Elastography Breast TumorClassification.Zhou Y, Xu J, Liu Q, Li C, Liu Z, Wang M, Zheng H, Wang S.This paper proposes a segmentation-free radiomics method to classify malignantand benign breast tumors with shear-wave elastography (SWE) data. The method istargeted to integrate the advantage of both SWE in providing important elasticwith morphology information and convolutional neural network (CNN) in automaticfeature extraction and accurate classification. Compared to traditional methods, the proposed method is designed to directly extract features from the datasetwithout the pre-requisite of segmentation and manual operation. This can keep theperi-tumor information which is lost by segmentation-based methods. With theproposed model trained on 205 cases (70 from malignant breast patients and 135from benign breast patients respectively), an accuracy of 95.79%, a sensitivityof 96.23% and a specificity of 95.65% was obtained for the final test. Thesuperior performances compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods and itsautomatic nature both demonstrate that the proposed method has a great potential to be applied to clinical computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1109/TBME.2018.2844188 PMID: 29993469
