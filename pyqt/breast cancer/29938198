This study aimed to describe the prevalence of humanpapillomavirus (HPV) in breast cancer and explore if women with prior cervicalneoplasia carry an increased risk of HPV-positive breast cancer compared to womenwithout.Methods: This case-control study identified 193 Danish women diagnosed withbreast cancer (1998-2012) at Aarhus University Hospital or Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev. Cases were 93 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasiagrade 3 or worse (CIN3+) prior to breast cancer. Controls were 100 women without prior cervical dysplasia. HPV testing and genotyping were done using SPF10PCR-DEIA-LiPA25 and an in-house semi-Q-PCR assay.Results: Overall HPV prevalence in breast cancer for the assays was 1.55% (95% CI0.32-4.48) and 0.52% (95% CI 0.01-2.85). There was no difference in HPVprevalence between cases and controls (2.15 vs. 1.00%, p = 0.61 and 1.08 vs.0.00%, p = 0.48). HPV prevalence in CIN3+ was 94.62% (95% CI 0.88-0.98).Concordance between the assays was 98.60%.Conclusion: HPV prevalence in breast cancer is very low suggesting no etiologicalcorrelation between HPV and breast cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00209 PMCID: PMC6002490PMID: 29938198
