In order to estimate thedose-response relationship more accurately, and to aid clinical decision making, a retrospective estimation of the radiation dose delivered to the site of thesubsequent breast cancer is required.Methods: For 174 Dutch and 170 UK female patients with breast cancer following HLtreatment, the 3-dimensional position of the breast cancer in the affected breastwas determined and transferred onto a CT-based anthropomorphic phantom. Using aradiotherapy treatment planning system the dose distribution on the CT-basedphantom was calculated for the 46 different radiation treatment field set-upsused in the study population. The estimated dose at the centre of the breastcancer, and a margin to reflect dose uncertainty were determined on the basis of the location of the tumour and the isodose lines from the treatment planning. We assessed inter-observer variation and for 47 patients we compared the resultswith a previously applied dosimetry method.Results: The estimated median point dose at the centre of the breast cancerlocation was 29.75 Gy (IQR 5.8-37.2), or about 75% of the prescribed radiotherapydose. The median dose uncertainty range was 5.97 Gy. We observed an excellentinter-observer variation (ICC 0.89 (95% CI: 0.74-0.95)). The absolute agreementintra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for inter-method variation was 0.59(95% CI: 0.37-0.75), indicating (nearly) good agreement. There were no systematicdifferences in the dose estimates between observers or methods.Conclusion: Estimates of the dose at the point of a subsequent breast cancer showgood correlation between methods, but the retrospective nature of the estimatesmeans that there is always some uncertainty to be accounted for.DOI: 10.1016/j.ctro.2017.09.004 PMCID: PMC5862668PMID: 29594225
