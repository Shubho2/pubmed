Most of the studies reveal that various substitutions at specificpositions on BT scaffold modulate the antitumor property. The potential of BTsencouraged us to synthesize a number of new2-((5-substitutedbenzothiazol-2-yl)thio)-N&rsquo;-(2-(4-(substitutedphenyl)ethylidene)acetohydrazide derivatives and investigate their probable anticanceractivity. 4-Substitued benzaldehyde derivatives (1a⁻1e) were afforded by thereaction of appropriate secondary amine and 4-fluorobenzaldehyde in DMF.Equimolar quantitates of 5-substitutedbenzothiazole-2-thiol, ethyl chloroacetate and K₂CO₃ were refluxed in acetone to obtain2-((5-substitutedbenzothiazol-2-yl)thio)acetate derivatives (2a,2b), whichreacted with excess of hydrazine hydrate to get2-((5-substitutebenzothiazol-2-yl)thio)acetohydrazides (3a,3b). In the last step,2-((5-substitutedbenzothiazol-2-yl)thio)-N&rsquo;-(4-substitutedbenzylidene)acetohydrazide derivatives (4a⁻4j) were synthesized by the reaction of 1a⁻1e and 3a⁻3bin EtOH. The anticancer activity of target compounds was evaluated in threesteps. First, an MTT test (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide) was performed to observe cytotoxic activity of the compounds againstcarcinogenic C6 (Rat brain glioma cell line), A549 (Human lung adenocarcinomaepithelial cell line), MCF-7 (Human breast adenocarcinoma cell line), and HT-29(Human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line) cancer cell lines. Healthy NIH3T3(Mouse embryo fibroblast cell line) cells were also subjected to MTT assay todetermine selectivity of the compounds towards carcinogenic cell lines. Secondly,inhibitory effects of selected compounds 4d, 4e, and 4h on DNA synthesis of C6cells were investigated. Finally, flow cytometric analysis were performed toidentify the death pathway of the carcinogenic cells.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23051054 PMID: 29724002
