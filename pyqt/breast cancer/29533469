We assessed model discriminative performance usingthe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibrationperformance using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and overall model performance usingNagelkerke R2 (NR).RESULTS: Compared to a model including only age, comorbidity, and cancer stageand treatment variables, adding HRQOL variables improved discrimination (AUC0.742 from 0.715) and overall performance (NR 0.221 from 0.190) with goodcalibration (p=0.96 from HL test).CONCLUSION: In a cohort of older women with early-stage breast cancer, HRQOLmeasures predict 10-year mortality independently of traditional breast cancerprognostic variables. These findings suggest that interventions aimed atimproving physical function, mental health, and social support might improve bothHRQOL and survival.© 2018, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2018, The American GeriatricsSociety.DOI: 10.1111/jgs.15340 PMID: 29533469
