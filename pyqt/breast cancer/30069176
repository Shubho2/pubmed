Epub 2018Jun 15.Proton Therapy for Primary Breast Cancer.Hug EB(1).Author information: (1)MedAustron Ion Therapy Center, Wiener Neustadt, Austria.Proton therapy reduces the integral dose received by normal tissues due to itsphysical properties of dose deposition in the Bragg peak. In a small butsignificant percentage of patients requiring adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) forleft-sided breast cancer, photon-based RT can lead to cardiac complicationsduring long-term follow-up. The risk of cardiac complications is correlated with the dose to the coronary arteries and to the general 'mean heart dose'.Dosimetric comparison analysis has identified advantages of proton therapy inaccomplishing sparing of the heart with increasing target complexity whilepermitting uncompromised target coverage of the chest wall Â± breast plus draininglymphatics. Early clinical data indicate good clinical tolerance to protontherapy without unexpected complications. Several clinical trials are presentlyongoing to prospectively confirm a clinical benefit and to identify the subgroup of patients benefitting most from proton therapy for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1159/000489893 PMCID: PMC6062734 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 30069176
