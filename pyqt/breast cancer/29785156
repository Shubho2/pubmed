Despite considerabledevelopments in treatment modalities, a subset of patients with advanced-stagebreast carcinoma display poor prognosis. Breast cancer heterogeneity and risk of recurrence could be explained with the help of cancer stem cell hypothesis. Stem cells have the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into multiple cell types.Aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1), an enzyme responsible for the oxidation ofintracellular aldehydes, contributes to normal and tumor stem celldifferentiation. Invasion and metastasis in breast cancer are found to bemediated by a subpopulation of tumor cells which exhibit stem cell-like features and express ALDH1.The aim was to document ALDH1 expression in breast carcinomaand find its association with other clinico-pathologic prognostic parameters.Study design: This was a cross-sectional observational study.Methods: A total of 62 patients with breast carcinoma undergoing mastectomy were included in this study. The tumors were classified into molecular subtypes byassessing immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of ER, PgR, HER2 and Ki-67according to St. Gallen Consensus Conference 2013. ALDH1 expression was studiedby IHC and correlated with clinicoathological parameters.Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis was done using Graph Pad software(Prism 5 version) for Windows 7. A p-value <0.05 was considered statisticallysignificant.Results and analysis: Out of 62 tumors, 35 tumors (56.4%) showed ALDH1positivity. ALDH1 expression was significantly associated with larger size, lymphnode involvement, higher grade, higher stage and HER2+ or triple negative tumors.Conclusion: This study suggests that ALDH1 expression is associated with poorprognostic parameters and aggressive tumor behavior. Larger population-basedprospective trials on Indian patients are required to validate these results.DOI: 10.15386/cjmed-925 PMCID: PMC5958983PMID: 29785156
