Electronic address: shaoc@suda.edu.cn.PARP inhibitors have been widely tested in clinical trials, especially for thetreatment of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and were shown to be highlysuccessful. Because PARP primarily functions in sensing and repairing DNA strand breaks, the therapeutic effect of PARP inhibition is generally believed to beattributed to impaired DNA repair. We here report that oxidative stress is alsoincreased by PARP inhibition and mediates the antitumor effect. We showed thatPARP1 is highly expressed in specimens of high grade serous ovarian carcinoma andits activity is required for unperturbed proliferation of ovarian cancer cells.Inhibition or depletion of PARP leads to not only an increase in DNA damage, but also an elevation in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly,antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated the induction of DNA damage and the perturbation of proliferation by PARP inhibition or depletion. We further showed that NADPH oxidases 1 and 4 were significantly upregulated by PARPinhibition and were partially responsible for the induction of oxidative stress. Depletion of NOX1 and NOX4 partially rescued the growth inhibition ofPARP1-deficient tumor xenografts. Our findings suggest that in addition tocompromising the repair of DNA damage, PARP inhibition or depletion may exertextra antitumor effect by elevating oxidative stress in ovarian cancer cells.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
