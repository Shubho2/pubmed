Here, we will review strategies to mitigate thesecardiotoxicities.RECENT FINDINGS: Recent consensus guidelines have established criteria for theidentification and surveillance of breast cancer patients at increased risk ofcardiotoxicity. Dose reduction, liposomal doxorubicin, and dexrazoxane may beconsidered in high-risk patients receiving anthracyclines. Anthracycline-freeregimens should be considered in high-risk patients with HER-2+ breast cancer, ifappropriate. Data to support the routine use of concomitant neurohormonalblockade or statins to prevent anthracycline- and trastuzumab-inducedcardiomyopathy is not yet available. Strategies that minimize radiation dose tothe heart such as deep inspiration and intensity-modulated radiation arerecommended to prevent radiation-induced cardiotoxicity. Identification ofhigh-risk patients, aggressive management of underlying cardiovascular riskfactors, consideration of cardioprotective strategies, and routine surveillanceof left ventricular function before and after therapy are recommended to reducebreast cancer treatment-associated cardiotoxicities.DOI: 10.1007/s11912-018-0710-1 PMID: 29876677
