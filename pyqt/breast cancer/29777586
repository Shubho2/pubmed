The interaction of tumour cells with platelets leads to theproduction of plethoric factors among which our review will focus onlysophosphatidic acid (LPA), because platelets are the highest producers of this bioactive lysophospholipid in the organism. LPA promotes platelet aggregation,and blocking platelet function decreases LPA signalling and leads to inhibitionof breast cancer cell metastasis. Autotaxin (ATX), a lysophospholipase Dresponsible for the basal concentration of LPA in blood, was detected in plateletα-granules. Functionally, active ATX is eventually released following tumourcell-induced platelet aggregation, thereby promoting metastasis. Megakaryocytesdo not express ATX but respond to LPA stimulation. Whether LPA-primedmegakaryocytes contribute to the recently reported negative action ofmegakaryocytes on cancer metastasis is not yet known. However, an understandingof the ATX/LPA signalling pathways in platelets, cancer cells and megakaryocytes opens up new approaches for fighting cancer metastasis.© 2018 The British Pharmacological Society.DOI: 10.1111/bph.14362 PMCID: PMC6031885 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29777586
