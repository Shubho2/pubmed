We report the first1000 tumors treated with this modality at our facility.METHODS: A total of 1000 distinct breast cancers in 984 patients (16 bilateral)were treated with breast conserving surgery and X-ray IORT from June 2010 toAugust 2017. Patients were enrolled in an IORT registry trial. Local recurrencewas the primary endpoint.RESULTS: There have been 28 ipsilateral local recurrences, ten DCIS and 18invasive. Four local recurrences were within the IORT field, 13 outside of theIORT field but within the same quadrant as the index cancer, and 11 were newcancers in different quadrants. There have been four regional nodal recurrencesand one distant recurrence. There have been no breast cancer related deaths and14 non-breast cancer deaths. With a median follow-up of 36 months, Kaplan-Meieranalysis projects 3.9% of patients will recur locally at 4 years. This includesall ipsilateral events in all quadrants.CONCLUSIONS: The local, regional, and distant recurrence rates observed in thistrial were comparable to those of the prospective randomized TARGIT-A and ELIOTtrials. The low complication rates previously reported by our group as well asthe low recurrence rates reported in this study support the cautious use andcontinued study of X-ray IORT in women with low-risk breast cancer.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6614-3 PMID: 29968030
