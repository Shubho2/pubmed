Despite the widespread use of systemic chemotherapy in patients with breastcancer, the optimal choice of vascular access is unknown.OBJECTIVE: This systematic review evaluated complication rates and patientsatisfaction with different access strategies for administering neo/adjuvantchemotherapy for breast cancer.EVIDENCE REVIEWED: Ovid Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register ofControlled Trials were searched from 1946 to September 2017. Two reviewersindependently assessed each citation. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used toassess the quality of cohort and case-control studies.FINDINGS: Of 1584 citations identified, 15 unique studies met the pre-specifiedeligibility criteria. There were no randomised studies comparing types ofvascular access. Reports included six single-institution retrospective cohortstudies, one retrospective multi-institution cohort, one retrospective cohortdatabase study, five prospective single-institution studies, one prospectivemulti-institution study and one nested case-control study. Median complicationrates were infection: 6.0% PICC (2 studies) versus 2.1% PORT (8 studies);thrombosis: 8.9% PICC (2 studies) versus 2.6% PORT (9 studies); extravasation: 0 PICC (1 study) versus 0.4% PORT (4 studies) and mechanical issues: PICC 3.8% (1study) versus 1.8% PORT (9 studies). Satisfaction/quality of life appeared highwith each device.CONCLUSION: In the absence of high-quality data comparing vascular accessstrategies, randomised, adequately powered, prospective studies would be requiredto help inform clinical practice and reduce variation.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4868-x PMID: 29974358
