Cases had invasivebreast cancer recurrence (at local, regional, or distant site) according to theprotocol definition. Matched controls had not recurred. Mutational analysis wasperformed with OncoCarta panel v1.0 using Mass Array System. The panel includes19 genes belonging to different functional pathways as PI3K pathway, receptortyrosine kinase, and cell cycle-metabolic group. Conditional logistic regression assessed the association of mutation status with breast cancer recurrence.RESULTS: Mutation assessment was successful for 135 patients (49 cases, 86controls). A total of 37 (27.4%) of the 135 patients had at least one mutation inthe selected genes. PIK3CA was the most common mutated gene (18/135; 13.3%),followed by BRAF, KIT and PDGFRA (each 4/135, 3.0%) and AKT1 (3/135; 2.2%). TNBC patients with at least one mutation had increased odds of recurrence comparedwith those with wild-type tumors (odds ratio (OR) 2.28; 95% CI 0.88-5.92), thoughthis difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). We found noevidence that these mutations were predictive for the value of maintenancemetronomic chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the tested oncogenes were not associated with breastcancer recurrence in this TNBC subset of patients. The question of whether any ofthese mutated genes (e.g., PIK3CA) may represent a useful therapeutic target inTNBC may be answered by ongoing clinical trials and/or larger dataset analysis.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4767-1 PMID: 29589138
