Epub2018 May 9.Effects on estrogen-dependent and triple negative breast cancer cells growth ofNi(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with the Schiff base derived frompyridine-2-carboxaldehyde and 5,6-diamino-1,3-dimethyluracil explored through therenin-angiotensin system (RAS)-regulating aminopeptidases.Illán-Cabeza NA(1), Jiménez-Pulido SB(1), Hueso-Ureña F(1), Ramírez-ExpósitoMJ(2), Sánchez-Sánchez P(3), Martínez-Martos JM(2), Moreno-Carretero MN(4).Author information: (1)Department of Inorganic and Organic Chemistry, University of Jaén, Jaén,Spain.(2)Department of Health Sciences, University of Jaén, Jaén, Spain.(3)Department of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.(4)Department of Inorganic and Organic Chemistry, University of Jaén, Jaén,Spain. Electronic address: mmoreno@ujaen.es.A series of Ni(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with the Schiff base derived fromthe condensation 1:1 from pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde and5,6-diamino-1,3-dimethyluracil(6-amino-1,3-dimethyl-5-[(pyridin-2-ylmethylidene)-amino]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione, DAAUPic) were synthesized and subsequently characterized by means ofelemental analysis, FT-IR, NMR and nine of them by X-ray diffraction. Except the [Zn(μ-O,O'-AcO)(N5,N6,N1F-DAAUPicH-1)]2 and[Cd(O,O'-NO3)(μ-O4,(N5,N6,N1F)-DAAUPicH-1)(H2O)]2·2H2O dimers and the[Cd(μ-S,N-SCN)(N5,N6,N1F-DAAUPicH-1)]n chain-like polymer, all of them displaymonomeric molecular structures. The anticancer activity of compounds was alsoexplored studying their effects on renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-regulatingaminopeptidases on estrogen-dependent and triple negative breast cancer celllines. At the concentrations used, some of the complexes showed different effectson (RAS) peptidases, which support the idea that their effects on cellgrowth/proliferation could be related to autocrine/paracrine regulatory functionsof their corresponding peptide substrates.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
