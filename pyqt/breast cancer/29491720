This study assessed alternative models of congruence in perceptions ofcoping and their mediating effects on adjustment to breast cancer.Methods: Seventy-two women in treatment for breast cancer and their husbandscompleted measures of marital adjustment, self-efficacy for coping, andadjustment to cancer. Karnofsky Performance Status was obtained from medicalrecords. Wives completed a measure of self-efficacy for coping (wives' ratings ofself-efficacy for coping [WSEC]) and husbands completed a measure ofself-efficacy for coping (husbands' ratings of wives' self-efficacy for coping[HSEC]) based on their perceptions of their wives' coping efficacy.Results: Interestingly, the correlation between WSEC and HSEC was only 0.207;thus, they are relatively independent perspectives. The following three modelswere tested to determine the nature of the relationship between WSEC and HSEC:discrepancy model (WSEC - HSEC), additive model (WSEC + HSEC), and multiplicativemodel (WSEC Ã— HSEC). The discrepancy model was not related to wives' adjustment; however, the additive (B=0.205, P<0.001) and multiplicative (B=0.001, P<0.001)models were significantly related to wives' adjustment. Also, the additive model mediated the relationship between performance status and adjustment.Discussion: Husbands' perception of their wives' coping efficacy contributedmarginally to their wives' adjustment, and the combination of WSEC and HSECmediated the relationship between functional status and wives' adjustment, thuspositively impacting wives' adjustment to cancer. Future research is needed todetermine the quality of the differences between HSEC and WSEC in order todevelop interventions to optimize the impact of these two relatively independent perspectives on cancer outcomes.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S157124 PMCID: PMC5815476PMID: 29491720
