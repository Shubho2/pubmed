Previously, we reported that UF-linked mutations in MED12 disrupt itsability to activate cyclin C (CycC)-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) in Mediator,implicating impaired Mediator-associated CDK8 activity in the molecularpathogenesis of these clinically significant lesions. Notably, the CDK8 paralogCDK19 is also expressed in myometrium, and both CDK8 and CDK19 assemble intoMediator in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting that CDK19 activity may also be germane to the pathogenesis of MED12 mutation-induced UFs. However, whetherand how UF-linked mutations in MED12 affect CDK19 activation is unknown. Herein, we show that MED12 allosterically activates CDK19 and that UF-linked exon 2mutations in MED12 disrupt its CDK19 stimulatory activity. Furthermore, we findthat within the Mediator kinase module, MED13 directly binds to the MED12 Cterminus, thereby suppressing an apparent UF mutation-induced conformationalchange in MED12 that otherwise disrupts its association with CycC-CDK8/19. Thus, in the presence of MED13, mutant MED12 can bind, but cannot activate,CycC-CDK8/19. These findings indicate that MED12 binding is necessary but notsufficient for CycC-CDK8/19 activation and reveal an additional step in theMED12-dependent activation process, one critically dependent on MED12 residuesaltered by UF-linked exon 2 mutations. These findings confirm that UF-linkedmutations in MED12 disrupt composite Mediator-associated kinase activity andidentify CDK8/19 as prospective therapeutic targets in UFs.Â© 2018 Park et al.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.001725 PMCID: PMC5880139 [Available on 2019-03-30]PMID: 29440396
