The aims of thisstudy were to investigate the association of insulin therapy with mammographicdensity (MD) as an intermediate phenotype for breast cancer and to assessassociations with long-term elevated circulating insulin levels using a geneticscore comprising 18 insulin-associated variants.METHODS: We used data from the KARolinska MAmmography (Karma) project, a Swedish mammography screening cohort. Insulin-treated patients with type 1 (T1D, n = 122)and type 2 (T2D, n = 237) diabetes were identified through linkage with thePrescribed Drug Register and age-matched to 1771 women without diabetes. Weassessed associations with treatment duration and insulin glargine use, and wefurther examined MD differences using non-insulin-treated T2D patients as anactive comparator. MD was measured using a fully automated volumetric method, andanalyses were adjusted for multiple potential confounders. Associations with the insulin genetic score were assessed in 9437 study participants without diabetes.RESULTS: Compared with age-matched women without diabetes, insulin-treated T1Dpatients had greater percent dense (8.7% vs. 11.4%) and absolute dense volumes(59.7 vs. 64.7 cm3), and a smaller absolute nondense volume (615 vs. 491 cm3).Similar associations were observed for insulin-treated T2D, and estimates werenot materially different in analyses comparing insulin-treated T2D patients with T2D patients receiving noninsulin glucose-lowering medication. In both T1D andT2D, the magnitude of the association with the absolute dense volume was highest for long-term insulin therapy (≥ 5 years) and the long-acting insulin analogglargine. No consistent evidence of differential associations by insulintreatment duration or type was found for percent dense and absolute nondensevolumes. Genetically predicted insulin levels were positively associated withpercent dense and absolute dense volumes, but not with the absolute nondensevolume (percentage difference [95% CI] per 1-SD increase in insulin geneticscore = 0.8 [0.0; 1.6], 0.9 [0.1; 1.8], and 0.1 [- 0.8; 0.9], respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The consistency in direction of association for insulin treatmentand the insulin genetic score with the absolute dense volume suggest a causalinfluence of long-term increased insulin exposure on mammographic dense breasttissue.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1026-7 PMID: 30092829
