Weused data augmentation to perform Bayesian Cox regression of the hazard of a hip,spine or wrist/forearm fracture, adjusting for age, history of fragilityfracture, corticosteroid use, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, dementia ordiabetes diagnoses.RESULTS: Of 10,259 included in the sample, 3,733 initiated on Tamoxifen and 6,526on an aromatase inhibitor (AI). Posterior probabilities that the HR exceeded 1for AI compared to Tamoxifen were 46% (HR=0.99, 95%CrI 0.71, 1.25), 35% (HR=0.94,95%CrI 0.78, 1.26) and 76% (HR=1.08, 95%CrI 0.88, 1.32) with an uninformativeprior, and 63% (HR=1.04, 95%CrI 0.83, 1.3), 84% (HR=1.12, 95%CrI 0.89, 1.4) and89% (HR=1.13, 95%CrI 0.93, 1.36) with an informative prior, for hip, spine andwrist/forearm fracture, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Prior information resulted in higher posterior probabilities. Thestrength of evidence for increased risk varied by fracture site.Copyright Â© 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2018.05.025 PMID: 29879465
