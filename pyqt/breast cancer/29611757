Systemic therapy is the mainstay oftreatment. Three women with hepatic dysfunction secondary to breast cancer whowere treated with eribulin are presented herein. In the first case, third-lineeribulin at the time of acute liver failure due to metastases maintained responsefor up to 9 months with good tolerability. In the second case, a woman withsecondary bone and liver disease had progression-free survival of 5 months tothird-line eribulin and, upon rechallenge after a drug holiday, had almost fourmore months of stable disease. Last, a heavily pretreated patient with secondary bone and hepatic involvement showed a response to fourth-line eribulin.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2017-0358 PMID: 29611757
