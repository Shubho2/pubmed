The aim of this meta-analysiswas to provide a pooled analysis of comparative clinical studies that evaluatedbreast cancer patients who were treated with a mastectomy and an immediateprosthetic breast reconstruction to compare the complications and satisfaction ofthose who underwent or did not undergo PMRT.METHODS: According to the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration, weestablished a rigorous study protocol. We performed a systematic electronicsearch of the PubMed and Embase databases to identify articles for inclusion inour meta-analysis. Reconstruction failure, overall complications, capsularcontracture, and patient satisfaction were analyzed individually.RESULTS: Fifteen controlled trials were included, comprising 5314 patients (1069 PMRT vs 4245 non-PMRT). Primary outcomes revealed a statistically significantincrease in overall complications [odds ratio (OR) 3.45; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.62-4.54; P < .00001], reconstruction failure (OR: 2.59; 95% CI1.46-4.62; P = .001), and capsular contracture (OR: 5.26, 95% CI: 2.73-10.13,P < .00001) after receiving PMRT.CONCLUSION: Our review found that PMRT for patients who underwent immediateimplant-based breast reconstruction led to higher risks of reconstructionfailure, overall complications, and capsular contracture. However, it is stillthe standard adjuvant therapy for mastectomy patients who have opted forimmediate implant-based breast reconstruction.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000009548 PMCID: PMC5944685PMID: 29419662  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
