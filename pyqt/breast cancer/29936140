An important question for funding agencies is whether the conduct of large chemoprevention trialsprovides strong scientific return on investment.METHODS: We evaluated the scientific impact of four large chemoprevention trials - two for breast cancer and two for prostate cancer - using citation analysis, a bibliometric technique. The results were compared to the scientific impact of aseries of treatment trials conducted over the same 20-year time period(1991-2010, inclusive). Average annual citation counts were compared usingt-tests. Scientific impact was also assessed relative to trial costs.RESULTS: Twenty-seven treatment trials with 17,208 patients and fourchemoprevention trials with 87,550 patients were examined. The mean annualcitation rate for primary articles was higher for chemoprevention trials comparedto treatment trials (188.1 vs. 40.4, p = .001). For both primary and secondaryarticle publications, mean annual citations for articles associated withchemoprevention trials were also higher (483.9 vs. 69.0, p = .0003). Largechemoprevention trials were estimated to provide 50% more total citations fromprimary and secondary articles on a cost-adjusted basis.CONCLUSION: Based on these criteria, the scientific impact of large phase IIIcancer chemoprevention trials was very high in absolute terms, and as good as or better than that of treatment trials after accounting for expenditure. Forappropriate scientific questions, large chemoprevention trials provide a goodscientific return on investment for federal funding agencies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
