China.Electronic address: dawnwuchen@163.com.GALNT14 is a member of N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase enzyme family andmediates breast cancer cell development. Here, we find that GALNT14 regulatesmultidrug resistance (MDR) in breast cancer. The expression of GALNT14 isassociated with MDR in breast cancer. Higher level of GALNT14 facilitates MCF-7cells to resist Adriamycin, whereas knockdown of GALNT14 sensitizes cells toAdriamycin. Moreover, the expression of GALNT14 associates with the expression ofP-gp, the efflux pump localized on the cell membrane, which could be theunderlying mechanism of how GALNT14 induces MDR. In-depth analysis shows thatGALNT14 regulates the stability of P-gp. Finally, GALNT14 associates with higher level of P-gp in chemotherapy-resistant human breast cancer tissues. Takentogether, our studies reveal a molecular mechanism in breast cancer MDR.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
