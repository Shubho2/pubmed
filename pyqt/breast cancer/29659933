The primary end point was overall survival, analyzed according to CTCdetection, using Cox regression models stratified by study. Secondary end points included distant disease-free survival, locoregional relapse-free interval, andpathological complete response. All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: Data from patients were collected before NCT (n = 1574) and beforesurgery (n = 1200). CTC detection revealed one or more CTCs in 25.2% of patients before NCT; this was associated with tumor size (P < .001). The number of CTCsdetected had a detrimental and decremental impact on overall survival (P < .001),distant disease-free survival (P < .001), and locoregional relapse-free interval (P < .001), but not on pathological complete response. Patients with one, two,three to four, and five or more CTCs before NCT displayed hazard ratios of death of 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65 to 1.69), 2.63 (95% CI = 1.42 to4.54), 3.83 (95% CI = 2.08 to 6.66), and 6.25 (95% CI = 4.34 to 9.09),respectively. In 861 patients with full data available, adding CTC detectionbefore NCT increased the prognostic ability of multivariable prognostic modelsfor overall survival (P < .001), distant disease-free survival (P < .001), andlocoregional relapse-free interval (P = .008).Conclusions: CTC count is an independent and quantitative prognostic factor inearly breast cancer patients treated by NCT. It complements current prognosticmodels based on tumor characteristics and response to therapy.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy018 PMID: 29659933
