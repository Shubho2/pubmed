MethodsTrastuzumab was conjugated with SCN-Bn-NOTA and radiolabeled with 64Cu. Serumstability and immunoreactivity of 64Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab were tested. Small animalPET imaging and biodistribution study were performed in HER2-positive breastcancer xenograft model (BT-474). Internal dosimetry of experimental animals wasperformed using the image-based approach with the Monte Carlo N-Particle Code.Results64Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab was prepared with high radiolabel yield andradiochemical purity (>98%) and showed high stability in serum and goodimmunoreactivity. Uptake of 64Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab was highest at 48 h afterinjection determined by PET imaging and biodistribution results in BT-474 tumors.The blood radioactivity concentrations of 64Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab decreasedbi-exponentially with time in both mice with and without BT-474 tumor xenografts.The calculated absorbed dose of 64Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab was 0.048 mGy/MBq for theheart, 0.079 for the liver and 0.047 for the spleen.Conclusion64Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab was effectively targeted to the HER2-expressingtumor in vitro and in vivo, and it exhibited relatively low absorbed dose due to short residence time. Therefore, 64Cu-NOTA-trastuzumab could be applied to selectthe right patients/right timing for HER2 therapy, to monitor the treatmentresponse after HER2-targeted therapy, and to detect distal or metastatic spread.Copyright Â© 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.210294 PMID: 29777007
