In this study, we evaluated the role of contrast-enhanced spectralmammogram (CESM) in correlation with three-dimensional (3D) breast ultrasound in characterizing the extension of the intramammary cancer in view of the: (i) thesize of the main tumor, (ii) the multiplicity of the breast cancer, and (iii) theperi-tumoral stromal involvement (i.e. free or intraductal extension of thecancer).METHODS: The study is a prospective analysis that included 300 breast massesproved to be malignant. The masses were evaluated for their size, multiplicityand surrounding stromal involvement. Contrast-based mammography performed withlow (22-33 kVp) and high (44-49 kVp) energy exposures that were taken after i.v. injection of contrast agent and followed by bilateral 3D breast ultrasound.Operative data were the gold standard reference.RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the sizes of the includedcancers as measured by CESM and 3D ultrasound and that measured at thepathological analysis. CESM showed higher accuracy (32.7%, n = 98) than3D ultrasound (24.7%, n = 74) in the size agreement within 5% range. CESM was themost accurate modality (94%, n = 282) in detecting tumor multiplicity, followedby traditional sonomammogram (88%, n = 264), then 3D breast ultrasound (84%, n = 252). Intraductal extension of the breast cancer was best evaluated by the3D ultrasound with an accuracy value of 98% (n = 294) compared to only 60% (n =180) by CESM.CONCLUSION: CESM is a recommended investigation in breast cancer to increase the accuracy of size measurement and the detection of multiple tumors. The additionof 3D ultrasound can enhance the detection of intraductal extension. Advances in knowledge: Choice of conservative breast surgery vs mastectomy is still a debate.We used an advanced, contrast-based, application of the mammogram: CESM and anon-invasive 3D breast ultrasound in the assessment of the local extension of thebreast cancer regarding size, perifocal stromal infiltration and multiplicity to guide the selection of proper management in proved cases of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20170977 PMID: 29641226  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
