The successful conjugating of PTX onto thenanoparticles (NPs) was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetricanalysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy (FTIR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) andtransmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The results showed that theaverage size was 46.11 ± 7.8 (mean± SD (n = 25)) nm. The cytotoxicity of void of PTX and F-Asp-PTX NPs were compared to each other by MTT assay of the treatedMCF-7 cell line. The F-Asp-PTX NPs showed pH-dependent drug release behavior.These studies specify that F-Asp-PTX NPs have a very remarkable anticancereffect, for breast cancer cell line.DOI: 10.1080/03639045.2018.1508222 PMID: 30073853
