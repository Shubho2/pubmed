China.Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has shown great potential in clinical cancertherapy, but the body's systemic immune must be fully activated and generates apositive tumor-specific immune cell response. In this work, we demonstrate thedesign of the immune-adjuvant nanodrug carriers on the basis of poly(ethyleneglycol)- block-poly(lactic- co-glycolic acid) copolymer-encapsulated Fe3O4superparticles (SPs), in which imiquimod (R837), a kind of Toll-like receptor 7agonist, is loaded. The nanodrug carriers are defined as Fe3O4-R837 SPs. Themultitasking Fe3O4-R837 SPs can destroy the 4T1 breast tumor by photothermaltherapy (PTT) under near-infrared laser irradiation to generate thetumor-associated antigens because of the high efficiency of tumor magneticattraction ability and photothermal effect. The PTT also triggers the release of R837 as the adjuvant to trigger a strong antitumor immune response. By furthercombining with the checkpoint blockade adjusted by programmed death ligand 1(PD-L1) antibody, the Fe3O4-R837 SP-involved PTT cannot only eliminate theprimary tumors but also prevent tumor metastasis to lungs/liver. Meanwhile, this synergistic therapy also shows abscopal effects by completely inhibiting thegrowth of untreated distant tumors through effectively triggering the tumorsinfiltrated by CD45+ leukocytes. Such findings suggest that Fe3O4-R837SP-involved PTT can significantly potentiate the systemic therapeutic efficiency of PD-L1 checkpoint blockade therapy by activating both innate and adaptiveimmune systems in the body.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b05876 PMID: 29878757
