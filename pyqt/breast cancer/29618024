However, therole of lncRNAs in the regulation of myogenesis remains poorly understood. Inthis study, we identified a novel muscle-enriched lncRNA called 'Myolinc(AK142388)', which we functionally characterized in the C2C12 myoblast cell line.Myolinc is predominately localized in the nucleus, and its levels increase uponinduction of the differentiation. Knockdown of Myolinc impairs the expression of myogenic regulatory factors and formation of multi-nucleated myotubes in culturedmyoblasts. Myolinc also regulates the expression of Filip1 in a cis-manner.Similar to Myolinc, knockdown of Filip1 inhibits myogenic differentiation.Furthermore, Myolinc binds to TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), aDNA/RNA-binding protein that regulates the expression of muscle genes (e.g. Acta1and MyoD). Knockdown of TDP-43 inhibits myogenic differentiation. We also showthat Myolinc-TDP-43 interaction is essential for the binding of TDP-43 to thepromoter regions of muscle marker genes. Finally, we show that silencing ofMyolinc inhibits skeletal muscle regeneration in adult mice. Altogether, ourstudy identifies a novel lncRNA that controls key regulatory networks ofmyogenesis.DOI: 10.1093/jmcb/mjy025 PMID: 29618024
