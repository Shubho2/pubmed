Recently published studies have suggested that approximately 4-5% of patients with new unprovoked VTE will be diagnosed with cancer within12Â months of follow-up. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to keep a lowthreshold of suspicion for occult cancer in this patient population. After anunprovoked VTE diagnosis, patients should undergo a thorough medical history,physical examination, basic laboratory investigations (ie, complete blood countand liver function tests), chest X-ray, as well as age- and gender-specificcancer screening (breast, cervical, colon, and prostate). More intensive cancerscreening including additional investigations (eg, computed tomography of theabdomen/pelvis) does not seem to increase the rate of occult cancer detection,decrease cancer-related morbidity, or increase survival or cost-effectiveness.DOI: 10.1002/rth2.12007 PMCID: PMC6058204PMID: 30046669
