Additionally, current breast cancer treatments can have a negativeimpact on cardiovascular health (eg, left ventricular dysfunction, acceleratedCVD), and for women with pre-existing CVD, this might influence cancer treatment decisions by both the patient and the provider. Improvements in early detectionand treatment of breast cancer have led to an increasing number of breast cancer survivors who are at risk of long-term cardiac complications from cancertreatments. For older women, CVD poses a greater mortality threat than breastcancer itself. This is the first scientific statement from the American HeartAssociation on CVD and breast cancer. This document will provide a comprehensive overview of the prevalence of these diseases, shared risk factors, thecardiotoxic effects of therapy, and the prevention and treatment of CVD in breastcancer patients.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000556 PMID: 29437116
