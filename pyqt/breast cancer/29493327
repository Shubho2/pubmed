However, not all patients complete theirplanned treatment, mostly because of side-effects. The aim of this study was toexamine the adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy in a cohort of primary breastcancer patients in Region Jönköping County, Sweden, after 3 and 5 years.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Swedish Breast Cancer Register was used to identifypatients diagnosed with hormone receptor positive breast cancer in RegionJönköping County between 2009 and 2012. Adherence was evaluated based on datafrom the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, and Medication Possession Ratio (MPR),defined as the days' supply of medication during the period from the firstdispensing till the last dispensing in the time period (3 and 5 years), dividedby number of days. Adherence was defined as MPR ≥80%. Regression analyses wereused to identify subgroups associated with adherence; age, type of endocrinetreatment, additional adjuvant therapy, and hospital responsible for thefollow-up (Eksjö, Jönköping, and Värnamo).RESULTS: We identified 634 patients who were recommended adjuvant endocrinetherapy and to be able to estimate adherence after 3 and 5 years, 488 patientswere included in the analysis. After 3 years of treatment, 91.2% of the patients (95% confidence interval (CI) 88.7-93.6; n = 445), were found to be adherent. Thecorresponding figure for the 271 patients who had completed 5 years of treatment was 91.5% (95% CI 88.2-94.8; n = 248). No subgroups (age, endocrine therapy,radio/chemotherapy, or hospital) were significantly associated with adherence in the multiple logistic regression analysis.DISCUSSION: This study shows substantially higher adherence to adjuvant endocrinetherapy than previously reported. Reasons for this could be differences inroutines for therapy information and follow-up, but this needs to be furtherinvestigated.DOI: 10.1080/0284186X.2018.1442932 PMID: 29493327
