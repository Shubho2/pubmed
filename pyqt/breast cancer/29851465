Luteinizinghormone-releasing hormone receptor (LHRH-R) has attracted considerable interestfor this application, since LHRH-R is upregulated in ∼86% of prostate cancers,∼80% of endometrial cancers, ∼80% of ovarian cancers, and ∼50% of breast cancers,but virtually absent from normal tissues. Although LHRH and related peptides havebeen used to deliver cytotoxic drugs to LHRH-R overexpressing cancer cells, they have suffered from off-target delivery of the therapeutic agents to the liver andkidneys. To reduce such unwanted uptake by peptide scavenger receptors in theliver and kidneys, we have explored the use of a nonpeptidic LHRH-R antagonist(NBI42902) to construct an LHRH-R targeted tubulysin conjugate (BOEPL-L3-TubBH). In vitro studies with BOEPL-L3-TubBH demonstrate that the conjugate can killLHRH-R expressing triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 cells) with lownanomolar IC50. Related studies on tumor-bearing mice further reveal that thesame conjugate can eradicate MDA-MB-231 solid tumors without any measurableside-effects, yielding mice that gain weight during therapy and show no evidence of tumor recurrence for at least 5 weeks after termination of treatment. Thatthese complete responses are LHRH-R targeted was then established by showing thatidentical treatment of receptor-negative (SKOV3) tumors yields no antitumorresponse. Overall, these data provide a proof-of-concept that LHRH-R specifictargeting of an extremely toxic drug like tubulysin B can treat LHRH-R positivetumors without causing significant toxicity to healthy cells.DOI: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00164 PMID: 29851465
