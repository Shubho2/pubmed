However, impact of gross ETE into strapmuscles on survival remains controversial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 2084 patients with ≤ 4 cmnonmetastatic differentiated thyroid cancer who underwent surgery between 2000and 2015 was conducted. Patients were divided into three groups according todegree of ETE: no ETE (group 1), ETE into perithyroidal soft tissue (group 2),and gross ETE into strap muscle (group 3). Survivals were analyzed usingKaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank test. Factors predictive ofsurvival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model.RESULTS: Ten-year disease-free survival (DFS) of patients in groups 1-3 was 90,82, and 83%, respectively (p = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, age ≥ 55 years, male sex, and pathologic N1b category predicted significantly worse DFS, whileETE into perithyroidal soft tissue or gross strap muscle invasion did not predictworse DFS. Overall survival (p = 0.957) and disease-specific survival (p =0.910) were not significantly different between the three groups. There was astatistically significant difference in locoregional recurrence-free survivalbetween groups 1 and 2 [HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.06-3.94].CONCLUSION: Gross strap muscle invasion may not be an important survivalprognostic factor for staging purposes. Although both gross strap muscle invasionand perithyroidal soft tissue extension may be predictive for locoregionalrecurrence, the distinction between them may not be as important forpostoperative risk stratification.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6563-x PMID: 30022274
