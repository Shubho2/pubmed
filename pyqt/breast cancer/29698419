Potential shared genetic susceptibility betweenbreast and colorectal cancer, not explained by high-penetrance genes, has beenpostulated. We hypothesized that yet undiscovered genetic variants predispose to a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype.METHODS: To identify variants associated with a breast-colorectal cancerphenotype, we analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from cases andcontrols that met the following criteria: cases (n = 985) were women with breast cancer who had one or more first- or second-degree relatives with colorectalcancer, men/women with colorectal cancer who had one or more first- orsecond-degree relatives with breast cancer, and women diagnosed with both breast and colorectal cancer. Controls (n = 1769), were unrelated, breast and colorectalcancer-free, and age- and sex- frequency-matched to cases. After imputation,6,220,060 variants were analyzed using the discovery set and variants associated with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype at P<5.0E-04 (n = 549, at 60 loci)were analyzed for replication (n = 293 cases and 2,103 controls).RESULTS: Multiple correlated SNPs in intron 1 of the ROBO1 gene were suggestivelyassociated with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype in the discovery andreplication data (most significant; rs7430339, Pdiscovery = 1.2E-04; rs7429100,Preplication = 2.8E-03). In meta-analysis of the discovery and replication data, the most significant association remained at rs7429100 (P = 1.84E-06).CONCLUSION: The results of this exploratory analysis did not find clear evidence for a susceptibility locus with a pleiotropic effect on hereditary breast andcolorectal cancer risk, although the suggestive association of genetic variation in the region of ROBO1, a potential tumor suppressor gene, merits furtherinvestigation.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196245 PMCID: PMC5919670PMID: 29698419  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
