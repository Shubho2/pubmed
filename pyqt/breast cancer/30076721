Recently, miR-214 emerged as a critical regulator of musculoskeletalmetabolism. Specifically, miR-214 can mediate skeletal muscle myogenesis andvascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation.MiR-214 also modulates osteoblast function by targeting specific molecularpathways and the expression of various osteoblast-related genes; promotesosteoclast activity by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten); andmediates osteoclast-osteoblast intercellular crosstalk via an exosomal miRNAparacrine mechanism. Importantly, dysregulation in miR-214 expression isassociated with pathological bone conditions such as osteoporosis, osteosarcoma, multiple myeloma, and osteolytic bone metastasis of breast cancer. This reviewdiscusses the cellular targets of miR-214 in bone, the molecular mechanismsgoverning the activities of miR-214 in the musculoskeletal system, and theputative role of miR-214 in skeletal diseases. Understanding the biology ofmiR-214 could potentially lead to the development of miR-214 as a possiblebiomarker and a therapeutic target for musculoskeletal diseases.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcp.26856 PMID: 30076721
