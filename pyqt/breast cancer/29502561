Patients were diagnosed between January 1, 1978, and December 31, 2014, including 2865 high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs), with more than 12,000 person-years of follow-up time. Tissuemicroarrays were stained for MyD88 and TLR4, and staining intensity wasclassified using a 2-tiered system for each marker (weak vs strong).RESULTS: Expression of MyD88 and TLR4 was similar in all histotypes except clear cell ovarian cancer, which showed reduced expression compared with otherhistotypes (P<.001 for both). In HGSOC, strong MyD88 expression was modestlyassociated with shortened overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% CI,1.01-1.26; P=.04) but was also associated with advanced stage (P<.001). Theexpression of TLR4 was not associated with survival. In low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC), strong expression of both MyD88 and TLR4 was associated withfavorable survival (HR [95% CI], 0.49 [0.29-0.84] and 0.44 [0.21-0.89],respectively; P=.009 and P=.02, respectively).CONCLUSION: Results are consistent with an association between strong MyD88staining and advanced stage and poorer survival in HGSOC and demonstratecorrelation between strong MyD88 and TLR4 staining and improved survival inLGSOC, highlighting the biological differences between the 2 serous histotypes.Copyright © 2017 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.
