Electronic address: xianghua@cpu.edu.cn.Both ERα and VEGFR-2 are important targets for cancer therapies. Here a series of2, 4-disubstituted pyrimidine derivatives were designed, synthesized andevaluated as dual ERα/VEGFR-2 ligands. Most of the derivatives exhibited potentactivities in both enzymatic and cellular assays. Structure-activity relationshipstudies showed that a hydrogen-bonding interaction in the head section isimportant factors for the enhancement of ERα-binding affinity. The most potentcompound II-9OH, an analog of 2-(4-hydroxylphenyl)pyrimidine, was 19-fold moreefficacious than tamoxifen in MCF-7 cancer cells and exhibited the best ERαbinding affinity (IC50 = 1.64 μM) as well as excellent VEGFR-2 inhibition(IC50 = 0.085 μM). Furthermore, this dual targeted compound II-9OH exertedsignificantly antiestrogenic property via suppressing the expression ofprogesterone receptor (PgR) mRNA in MCF-7 cells and also showed obvious in vivoangiogenesis inhibitory effects in CAM assay. An induction of apoptosis and adecrease in cell migration, accompanied by transduction inhibition ofRaf-1/MAPK/ERK pathway, were observed in MCF-7 cells after treatment with II-9OH,suggesting that II-9OH is a promising candidate for the development ofmultifunctional agents targeting ERα and VEGFR-2 in the therapy of some breastcancers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
