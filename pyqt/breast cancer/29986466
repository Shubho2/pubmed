However, theunderlying mechanisms of resistance in gastric cancer have not been fullyelucidated. Here, we established trastuzumab-resistant MKN45 and NCI N87 gastric cancer sublines from their parental cells. The resistant cells exhibitedcharacteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and acquired highermigratory and invasive capacities. To exploit the activated pathways and develop new strategies to overcome trastuzumab resistance, we investigated MKN45 andMKN45/R cells via label-free quantitative proteomics, and found pathways thatwere altered significantly in MKN45/R cells, with the Wnt/&beta;-catenin pathway being the most significant. We further confirmed the activation of this pathwayby detecting its key molecules in MKN45/R and NCI N87/R cells via Western blot,in which Wnt3A, FZD6, and CTNNB1 increased, whereas GSK-3&beta; decreased,manifesting the activation of the Wnt/&beta;-catenin pathway. Correspondingly,inhibition of Wnt/&beta;-catenin pathway by ICG-001, a specificWnt/&beta;-catenin inhibitor, preferentially reduced proliferation and invasionof trastuzumab-resistant cells and reversed EMT. Concurringly, CTNNB1 knockdownin stable cell lines potently sensitized cells to trastuzumab and induced moreapoptosis. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the Wnt/&beta;-cateninpathway mediates trastuzumab resistance, and the combination ofWnt/&beta;-catenin inhibitors with trastuzumab may be an effective treatmentoption.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19071981 PMID: 29986466
