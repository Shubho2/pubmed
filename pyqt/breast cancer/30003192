Althoughenormous efforts have been made toward the development of specificimmunotherapeutic strategies against gastrointestinal cancers, such as adoptiveT-cell transfer, peptide vaccines, or dendritic cell vaccines, the efficacy ofimmunotherapies prior to the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors was notsubstantial. This article reviews immunotherapy for gastrointestinalmalignancies, including cell therapy, peptide vaccine, and immune checkpointinhibitors, and attempts to resolve the immunosuppressive conditions surrounding the tumor microenvironment, and to construct novel combination immunotherapiesbeyond immune checkpoint inhibitors.DOI: 10.1002/ags3.12180 PMCID: PMC6036392PMID: 30003192
