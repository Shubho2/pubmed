The transmissionof bystander effects among cancer cells involves the activation of inflammatorycytokines, death ligands, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. In addition tobystander effects, two other forms of non-target effects (NTEs) have beenidentified in radiotherapy, as one is called cohort effects and the other iscalled abscopal effects. Cohort effects represent the phenomenon where irradiatedcells can produce signals that reduce the survival of neighboring cells within anirradiated volume. The effects suggest the importance of cellular communicationunder irradiation with non-uniform dose distribution. In contrast, abscopaleffects describe the NTEs that typically occur in non-irradiated cells distantfrom an irradiated target. These effects can be mediated primarily by immunecells such as T cells. Clinical trials have shown that application of radiationalong with immunotherapy may enhance abscopal effects and improve therapeuticefficacy on non-target lesions outside an irradiated field. According to NTEs,cell viability is reduced not only by direct irradiation effects, but also due tosignals emitted from nearby irradiated cells. A clinical consideration of NTEscould have a revolutionary impact on current radiotherapy via the establishmentof more efficient and less toxic radiobiological models for treatment planningcompared to conventional models. Thus, we will review the most updated findingsabout these effects and outline their mechanisms and potential applications incancer treatment with a special focus on the brain, lung, and breast cancers.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24746 PMCID: PMC5915099PMID: 29719632
