Recently, we found that the piperidonecompound P2 exhibits a potent anti-neoplastic activity against human breastcancer-derived cells. Here, we aimed to evaluate two piperidone compounds, P1 andP2, for their potential anti-neoplastic activity against humanleukemia/lymphoma-derived cells.METHODS: Cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction were evaluated using MTS, annexinV-FITC/PI and mitochondrial membrane potential polychromatic assays to confirmthe mode of action of the piperidone compounds. The effects of compound P1 and P2treatment on gene expression were assessed using AmpliSeq analysis and,subsequently, confirmed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting.RESULTS: We found that the two related piperidone compounds P1 and P2 selectivelykilled the leukemia/lymphoma cells tested at nanomolar concentrations throughinduction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, as demonstrated by mitochondrialdepolarization and caspase-3 activation. AmpliSeq-based transcriptome analyses ofthe effects of compounds P1 and P2 on HL-60 acute leukemia cells revealed adifferential expression of hundreds of genes, 358 of which were found to beaffected by both. Additional pathway analyses revealed that a significant number of the common genes were related to the unfolded protein response, implying apossible role of the two compounds in the induction of proteotoxic stress.Subsequent analyses of the transcriptome data revealed that P1 and P2 inducedsimilar gene expression alterations as other well-known proteasome inhibitors.Finally, we found that Noxa, an important mediator of the activity of proteasome inhibitors, was significantly upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels,indicating a possible role in the cytotoxic mechanism induced by P1 and P2.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the cytotoxic activity of P1 and P2 onleukemia/lymphoma cells is mediated by proteasome inhibition, leading toactivation of pro-apoptotic pathways.DOI: 10.1007/s13402-018-0397-1 PMID: 30088262
