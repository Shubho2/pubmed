Electronic address: xueqi@cicams.ac.cn.Esophageal cancer is a relatively common malignancy with a poor prognosis and is conventionally treated by surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, dueto the prevalence of cancer relapse with treatment resistance, novel moleculartargets must be identified for the development of alternative therapies. Emergingevidence indicates that ion channels play important roles in cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation and could therefore be considered as apotential oncological therapy. Therapies that target single oncogenic channelhave shown promise. However, therapies that target more than one ion channel havenot been developed. We propose that therapies targeting more than one type of ionchannel might be an alternative treatment for esophageal cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
