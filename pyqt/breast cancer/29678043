The study aims to identify and evaluate the meaningful associationsbetween TCM herbs and breast cancer by using the association rule mining (ARM)techniques. We employed the ARM techniques for 19.9 million TCM prescriptions by using Taiwan National Health Insurance claim database from 1999 to 2013. 364 TCM herbs-breast cancer associations were derived from those prescriptions and werethen filtered by their support of 20. Resulting of 296 associations wereevaluated by comparing to a gold-standard that was curated information fromChinese-Wikipedia with the following terms, cancer, tumor, malignant. All 14 TCM herbs-breast cancer associations with their confidence of 1% were valid whencompared to gold-standard. For other confidences, the statistical results showed consistently with high precisions. We thus succeed to identify the TCMherbs-breast cancer associations with useful techniques.PMID: 29678043  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
