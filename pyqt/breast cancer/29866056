There are no previous studies on its effects in human inflammatory breastcancer or canine inflammatory mammary cancer that is the most aggressive type of breast cancer.METHODS: The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of indole-3-carbinol on a SCID mice xenograft model of canine inflammatory mammary cancer, usingequivalent human oral dose as a preventive therapy in humans for 3 weeks.RESULTS: Indole-3-carbinol treatment decreased tumor proliferation and increased apoptosis, although tumor embolization and liver metastasis were observed in someanimals. There was a characteristic subpopulation of lipid-rich cells andincreased contents of select steroid hormones in tumor homogenates and serum.CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal for the first time that the ingestion ofindole-3-carbinol, as administered, diminishes proliferation and increasesapoptosis of tumor cells in an experimental model of inflammatory breast cancer, although this effect could not be enough to avoid the appearance of tumorembolization and metastasis. Future clinical trials will be needed to clarify theusefulness of indole-3-carbinol in this cancer and to understand the molecularmechanisms involved.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4518-z PMCID: PMC5987405PMID: 29866056
