Using simulations based on 440preclinical studies across 13 different interventions in animal models of stroke,myocardial infarction, and breast cancer, we compared the accuracy of effect sizeestimates between single-laboratory and multi-laboratory study designs.Single-laboratory studies generally failed to predict effect size accurately, andlarger sample sizes rendered effect size estimates even less accurate. Bycontrast, multi-laboratory designs including as few as 2 to 4 laboratoriesincreased coverage probability by up to 42 percentage points without a need forlarger sample sizes. These findings demonstrate that within-study standardizationis a major cause of poor reproducibility. More representative study samples arerequired to improve the external validity and reproducibility of preclinicalanimal research and to prevent wasting animals and resources for inconclusiveresearch.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.2003693 PMCID: PMC5823461PMID: 29470495
