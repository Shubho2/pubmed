China.It is abundantly clear that tumor-derived parathyroid hormone-related protein(PTHrP), receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) andosteoprotegerin (OPG) are central contributors in promoting osteolytic process ofbreast carcinoma bone metastasis. Forcusing on this molecular basis, the studywas undertaken to explore the inhibition effects of total flavonoids fromScutellaria barbata D. Don (TF-SB) on human breast carcinoma bone metastasis.MDA-MB-231 cells and nude mouse models of breast cancer bone metastasis weregiven TF-SB in different concentrations. The proliferation, migration andinvasion potentials of MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively tested. The effects of TF-SB on tumor weights and bone destruction were investigated. The mRNA andprotein expression of PTHrP, OPG and RANKL were assessed by qPCR and western blotanalysis. In vitro, TF-SB inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, TF-SB prevented bonemetastasis of breast cancer by decreasing the number of osteoclast cells perfield in a dose-dependent manner, but not affecting tumor growth or mousesurvival. Molecular analysis revealed that TF-SB controled the secretion ofosteolysis-related factors PTHrP and its downstream RANKL/OPG. Together, bycontrolling the expression of PTHrP and its downstream OPG/RANKL, TF-SB hassignificant inhibition effects on breast cancer bone metastasis, which indicates a new therapeutic method.DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.2018.3515 PMCID: PMC5881663PMID: 29512770
