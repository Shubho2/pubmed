Targeting this cancer hallmark is alogical strategy for imaging based cancer detection and monitoring theanti-angiogenesis treatment. Using Bevacizumab (Avastin®), which is a recombinanthumanized monoclonal antibody directly against VEGF and an angiogenesisinhibitor, as a targeting ligand, a multimodal VEGF targeted molecular imagingprobe was developed by conjugating near infrared dye (NIR830) labeled bevacizumabto magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) for optical and magnetic resonance(MR) imaging of cancers over-expressing VEGF. The targeting effect ofNIR830-bevacizumab-IONPs on VEGF over-expressing cells was investigated byreceptor mediated cell uptake experiments and a blocking assay using VEGFover-expressing 4T1 breast cancer cells. Systemic administration of VEGF-targetedNIR830-bevacizumab-IONPs into mice bearing 4T1 breast tumors resulted in higheraccumulation of targeting IONPs in tumors compared to non-targeted IONPs.Quantitative analysis of T2-weighted MRI at 48 h post-injection revealed that theaveraged percentage of signal intensity change in tumors treated withNIR830-bevacizumab-IONPs was 52.4 ± 11.0% compared to 26.9 ± 12.4% in controlstreated with non-targeted IONPs. The results demonstrated the feasibility andefficacy of NIR830-bevacizumab-IONPs as a VEGF targeting dual-modality molecular imaging probe that can be potentially used for imaging of cancers with VEGFover-expression and delivery of bevacizumab for imaging guided anti-cancertreatment.DOI: 10.1039/c8bm00225h PMID: 29652061
