Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a minimally invasivetechnique with low morbidity in axillary staging of breast cancer. Radiocolloidsubstances (Technetium-99m) and/or blue dyes such as methylene blue or isosulfan blue are used during sentinel lymph node biopsy. Isosulfan blue stain isfrequently used in sentinel lymph node biopsy and rarely causes complications.The present case report presents a severe decrease in SpO2 due tomethemoglobinemia following isosulfan blue administration as well as skin andurine signs and inconsistency with clinical picture in a 67-year-old, 77 kg, ASA II female case who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy under general anesthesia.DOI: 10.5152/turkjsurg.2017.3137 PMCID: PMC5937668PMID: 29756115
