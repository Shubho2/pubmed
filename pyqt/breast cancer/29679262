The receptor activator of nuclearfactor κB (RANK)/RANK ligand (RANKL) pathway has been implicated in thedevelopment of breast cancer. Given the role of RANK signaling in mammaryepithelial cell proliferation, we hypothesized this pathway may also beassociated with mammographic density. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy receptor forRANKL, is known to inhibit RANK signaling. Thus, it is of interest to evaluatewhether OPG levels modify breast cancer risk through mammographic density.METHODS: We quantified serum OPG levels in 57 premenopausal and 43 postmenopausalwomen using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cumulus was used tomeasure percent density, dense area, and non-dense area for each mammographicimage. Subjects were classified into high versus low OPG levels based on themedian serum OPG level in the entire cohort (115.1 pg/mL). Multivariate modelswere used to assess the relationship between serum OPG levels and the measures ofmammographic density.RESULTS: Serum OPG levels were not associated with mammographic density amongpremenopausal women (P ≥ 0.42). Among postmenopausal women, those with low serum OPG levels had higher mean percent mammographic density (20.9% vs. 13.7%; P =0.04) and mean dense area (23.4 cm2 vs. 15.2 cm2; P = 0.02) compared to thosewith high serum OPG levels after covariate adjustment.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that low OPG levels may be associated withhigh mammographic density, particularly in postmenopausal women. Targeting RANKsignaling may represent a plausible, non-surgical prevention option for high-riskwomen with high mammographic density, especially those with low circulating OPGlevels.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1035-y PMID: 29679262
