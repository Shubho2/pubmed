However, it isdifficult to simultaneously achieve stability and pH-responsiveness in thepolymer⁻liposomes. In this study, stable and pH-sensitive crosslinkedpolymer⁻liposomes were fabricated through electrostatic interactions. ThepH-sensitive copolymer methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(methacrylicacid)-cholesterol (mPEG-b-P(MAAc)-chol) and crosslinking reagent poly(ethyleneglycol) with end-capped with lysine (PEG-Lys2) were synthesized andcharacterized. At physiological conditions, the pH-sensitive copolymers wereanionic and interacted electrostatically with the cationic crosslinker PEG-Lys2, forming the electrostatically-crosslinked polymer⁻liposomes and stabilizing theliposomal structure. At pH 5.0, the carboxylic groups in mPEG-b-P(MAAc)-chol wereneutralized, and the liposomal structure was destroyed. The particle size of the crosslinked polymer⁻liposomes was approximately 140 nm and the polymer⁻liposomes were loaded with the anticancer drug doxorubicin. At pH 7.4, the crosslinkedpolymer⁻liposomes exhibited good stability with steady particle size and low drugleakage, even in the presence of fetal bovine serum. At pH 5.0, the architecture of the crosslinked polymer⁻liposomes was damaged following rapid drug release, asobserved by using transmission electron microscopy and their apparent sizevariation. The crosslinked polymer⁻liposomes were pH-sensitive within theendosome and in the human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, as determined by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The intracellular drug release profilesindicated cytotoxicity in cancer cells. These results indicated that thehighly-stable and pH-sensitive electrostatically-crosslinked polymer⁻liposomesoffered a potent drug-delivery system for use in anticancer therapies.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19061615 PMCID: PMC6032249PMID: 29848991
