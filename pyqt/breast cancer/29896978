This study examines associations betweenCM use and cancer screening rates.METHODS: Women aged 62 to 67 years from the Australian Longitudinal Study onWomen's Health were surveyed regarding their use of cancer screening initiatives.Associations between cancer screening behavior and visits to CM practitionerswere analyzed.RESULTS: Of the 9151 women, 9049 (98.9%) completed questions about cancerscreening. A total of 65.1% of women had received a clinical skin examination,54.3% colorectal cancer screening, 56.2% Pap test (within past 2 years), 83.3%mammogram (within past 2 years), 55.8% clinical breast examination, and 55.8% hadconducted breast self-examination. Women who had consulted a massage therapistwere more likely to undergo clinical skin examination ( P = .002), clinicalbreast examination ( P = .018), and mammogram ( P = .001). Women who hadconsulted a chiropractor were more likely to undergo a clinical skin examination ( P = .001), colorectal cancer screening ( P = .020), and mammogram ( P = .011). Women who had consulted an acupuncturist were more likely to undergo colorectalcancer screening ( P = .019), and those who consulted with an osteopath were moreliable to have a Pap test ( P = .049).CONCLUSION: Women who visit CM practitioners are more likely to participate incancer screening initiatives. Research is required to understand the current and potential role that CM practitioners (can) have as public health advocates,recommending preventative health measures such as cancer screening. Such anexamination will help ensure optimal screening utilization and effective, timely care for all cancer patients.DOI: 10.1177/1534735418781728 PMID: 29896978
