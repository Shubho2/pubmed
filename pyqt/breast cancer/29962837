In the present qualitative descriptive study, we examined thepractice context that influences implementation of existing clinical practiceguidelines for providing such care. The purpose was to determine the challenges, strengths, and opportunities related to implementing comprehensive evidence-basedbca survivorship care guidelines by pcps in southeastern Ontario.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 pcps: 10 physiciansand 9 nurse practitioners.Results: Thematic analysis revealed 6 themes within the broad categories ofknowledge, attitudes, and resources. Participants highlighted 3 major challenges related to providing bca survivorship care: inconsistent educational preparation,provider anxieties, and primary care burden. They also described 3 majorstrengths or opportunities to facilitate implementation of survivorship careguidelines: tools and technology, empowering survivors, and optimizing nursingroles.Conclusions: We identified several important challenges to implementation ofcomprehensive evidence-based survivorship care for bca survivors, as well asseveral strengths and opportunities that could be built upon to address thosechallenges. Findings from our research could inform targeted knowledgetranslation interventions to provide support and education for pcps and bcasurvivors.DOI: 10.3747/co.25.3826 PMCID: PMC6023569PMID: 29962837
