However, the role of PEAK1 in the progression and metastasis of lung cancer is still unknown. Here, we observed that ectopic PEAK1 expression promoted lung cancer cell migration and invasion, while PEAK1 knockout resultedin suppressed cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, cell proliferation did not significantly increase or decrease in either the PEAK1 overexpression orknockout groups compared with the corresponding control cells. In addition, PEAK1overexpression could induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and theexpression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and MMP9 both in vitro and invivo, whereas PEAK1 knockout had the opposite effects. Then, we had confirmedthat PEAK1 was significantly upregulated in lung cancer tissues, and correlatedwith a higher tumor node metastasis stage. Moreover, PEAK1 upregulation markedly enhanced the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) andJanus kinase-2 (JAK2) signaling in lung cancer cells. Further work demonstratedthat the combination of PD98059 with AZD1480 could reverse the effects ofPEAK1-induced EMT, cell migration and invasion. Our findings highlight a newermechanism for PEAK1 in regulating EMT and metastasis in lung cancer, which might serve as a therapeutic target for lung cancer patients.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0817-1 PMCID: PMC6056550PMID: 30038287
