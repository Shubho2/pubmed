Electronicaddress: o.v.tellingen@nki.nl.The anticancer drug temozolomide is the only drug with proven activity againsthigh-grade gliomas and has therefore become a part of the standard treatment ofthese tumors. P-glycoprotein (P-gp; ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein(BCRP; ABCG2) are transport proteins, which are present at the blood-brainbarrier and limit the brain uptake of substrate drugs. We have studied the effectof P-gp and BCRP on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temozolomide,making use of a comprehensive set of in vitro transport experiments and in vivopharmacokinetic and antitumor efficacy experiments using wild-type, Abcg2-/-,Abcb1a/b-/-, and Abcb1a/b;Abcg2-/- mice. We here show that the combined deletion of Abcb1a/b and Abcg2 increases the brain penetration of temozolomide by 1.5-foldcompared to wild-type controls (P < .001) without changing the systemic drugexposure. Moreover, the same increase was achieved when temozolomide was given towild-type mice in combination with the dual P-gp/BCRP inhibitor elacridar(GF120918). The antitumor efficacy of temozolomide against three differentintracranial tumor models was significantly enhanced when Abcb1a/b and Abcg2 weregenetically deficient or pharmacologically inhibited in recipient mice. Thesefindings call for further clinical testing of temozolomide in combination withelacridar for the treatment of gliomas, as this offers the perspective of furtherimproving the antitumor efficacy of this already active agent.Copyright Â© 2018.
