Src is a tyrosine kinase identified as the product of the proto-oncogene and is supposed to promote cancer development andmetastasis. Src inhibitors are recently developed and have shown efficacy inbreast cancer. Increasing evidences suggest that aberrant expression of miRNAs isinvolved in cancer development and drug resistance. Identifying miRNAs associatedwith drug resistance may enhance the sensitivity of targeted therapies, includingSrc inhibitors. In this study, we established a Src inhibitorsaracatinib-resistant breast cancer cell line (SK-BR-3/SI) for the first time.Microarray data and qRT-PCR results showed that miR-19b-3p expression wasdownregulated in saracatinib-resistant cells compared with saracatinib-sensitive cells. Downregulation of miR-19b-3p remarkably increased the IC50 value ofsaracatinib, and promoted cell migration. Further studies found that miR-19b-3preduced PIK3CA expression by directly targeting PIK3CA gene and the resistance ofSrc inhibitor might be associated with activation of PI3K/Akt pathway afterdownregulation of miR-19b-3p. Moreover, we demonstrated that PI3K inhibitorLY294002 could reverse saracatinib resistance in saracatinib-resistant cells,which deserved further preclinical and clinical evaluation of dual inhibition of Src and PI3K in breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
