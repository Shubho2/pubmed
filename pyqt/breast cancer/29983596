Itsprognostic role has been described in the metastatic setting, but the role ofpre-surgical CA15-3 in the assessment of patients with breast cancer withoutmetastasis has not been substantiated yet.Methodology: From February 2014 for a 2-year period, this prospective studyincluded all patients who were diagnosed with primary breast cancer and underwentsurgery at a tertiary care hospital. The serum level of CA15-3 was assessed on a pre-surgical blood sample and later at the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed with a Kaplan-Meier model and log-rank test.Results: We enrolled 195 patients (mean age ± SD 57.84 years ±13.819, range,28-95) with breast cancer. The prevalence of elevated (≥30 U/mL) pre-surgicalCA15-3 was 35.9%, and it reduced to 14.3% at 3 months after mastectomy.Pre-surgical CA15-3 had a significant association only with the size of the tumor(p=0.047). Patients who did not have elevated pre-surgical CA15-3 (≥30 U/mL) had the best short-term DFS, and it was worst when the pre-surgical CA15-3 was >100U/mL (p=0.041).Conclusion: Elevated pre-surgical CA15-3 is a predictor of poor short-term DFS ofpatients with breast cancer without distant metastasis.DOI: 10.2147/IJWH.S162867 PMCID: PMC6027693PMID: 29983596
