Electronic address: javier.torresroca@moffitt.org.INTRODUCTION: We assessed the radiosensitivity of lung metastases on the basis ofprimary histologic type by using a validated gene signature and model lungmetastases for the gnomically adjusted radiation dose (GARD).METHODS: Tissue samples were identified from our prospective observationalprotocol. The radiosensitivity index (RSI) 10-gene assay was run on samples andcalculated alongside the GARD by using the previously published algorithms. Acohort of 105 patients with 137 lung metastases treated with stereotactic bodyradiation therapy (SBRT) at our institution was used for clinical correlation.RESULTS: A total of 138 unique metastatic lung lesions from our institution'stissue biorepository were identified for inclusion. There were significantdifferences in the RSI of lung metastases on the basis of histology. In order of decreasing radioresistance, the median RSIs for the various histologic types ofcancer were endometrial adenocarcinoma (0.49), soft-tissue sarcoma (0.47),melanoma (0.44), rectal adenocarcinoma (0.43), renal cell carcinoma (0.33), head and neck squamous cell cancer (0.33), colon adenocarcinoma (0.32), and breastadenocarcinoma (0.29) (p = 0.002). We modeled the GARD for these samples andidentified the biologically effective dose necessary to optimize local control.The 12- and 24-month Kaplan-Meier rates of local control for radioresistantversus radiosensitive histologic types from our clinical correlation cohort afterlung SBRT were 92%/87% and 100%, respectively (p = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, we have noted significant differences inradiosensitivity on the basis of primary histologic type of lung metastases andhave modeled the biologically effective dose necessary to optimize local control.This study suggests that primary histologic type may be an additional factor toconsider in selection of SBRT dose to the lung and that dose personalization may be feasible.Copyright © 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.Published by Elsevier Inc.
