Detection ofinherited mutations in asymptomatic carriers allows for the implementation ofappropriate preventive measures. BRCA1/2 genotyping is also important forpoly(adenosine diphosphate)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor administration.This work addresses the need for next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for the detection of BRCA1/2 mutations in Poland where until recently mostly founder mutations have been tested, and whether BRCA diagnostics should be extendedbeyond the panel of founder mutations in this population. The study comprises2931 patients who were referred for genetic counseling and tested for founder andrecurrent mutations in BRCA1 (5382insC (c.5266dupC; p.Gln1756Profs), c.5370C>T(c.5251C>T; p.R1751*), 300T>G (c.181T>G; p.Cys61Gly), 185delAG (c.68_69delAG;p.Glu23Valfs), and 4153delA (c.4035delA; p.Glu1346Lysfs)) by high-resolutionmelting/Sanger sequencing. A total of 103 (3.5%) mutations were detected,including 53 (51%) in healthy subjects and 50 (49%) in cancer patients. Then,based on more stringent clinical and pedigree criteria, sequencing of all BRCA1/2exons was performed in 454 (16%) patients without founder mutations by NGS, whichdetected 58 mutations (12.8%), 40 (8.8%) of which were pathogenic. In 14 (3.1%)subjects, variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were detected, and in four(0.9%) subjects, the detected mutations were benign. In total, 161 mutations weredetected using our two-step algorithm (founder test and NGS), of which 64% werefounder mutations, 25% were NGS-detected pathogenic mutations, 9% were VUS, and2% were benign. In addition, 38 mutations not yet reported in the Polishpopulation were detected. In total, founder mutations accounted for only 64% ofall detected mutations, and the remaining mutations (36%) were dispersed acrossthe BRCA1/2 gene sequences. Thus, in Poland, testing for constitutional mutationsin BRCA1/2 should be carried out in two stages, where NGS is performed inqualifying subjects if founder mutations are not identified.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0201086 PMCID: PMC6057642PMID: 30040829
