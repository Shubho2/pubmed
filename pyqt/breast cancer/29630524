Serum miR-658 may be associated with metastasis of gastriccancer (MGC) by affecting PAX3-MET pathway.METHODS: Ninety-eight gastric carcinoma patients with distant MGC (DM group) and ninety-six gastric carcinoma patients with no MGC (NM group) were recruited.Serum miR-658 was validated between DM and NM groups by using quantitativereverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). PAX3 and MET levels were measured by WesternBlot. The molecular mechanism for the function of serum miR-658 was furthervalidated in gastric cell lines.RESULTS: The results demonstrate that serum level of miR-658 is significantlylower in the NM group than in the DM group (P< 0.001). Meanwhile, the levels ofPAX3 and MET are lower in the NM group than in the DM group too (P< 0.01). Bothoverexpression and silence of miR-658 significantly up-regulate or down-regulate the levels of PAX3 and MET in gastric cell lines (P< 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The present findings demonstrate that elevated circulating miR-658is associated with MGC by activating PAX3-MET pathway.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-171045 PMID: 29630524
