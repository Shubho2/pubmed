[Epub ahead of print](-)-Epigallocatechin gallate derivatives reduce the expression of both urokinase plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 to inhibit migration,adhesion, and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells.Shin S(1), Kim MK(1), Jung W(2), Chong Y(1).Author information: (1)Department of Integrative Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio/MolecularInformatics Center, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.(2)Department of Emergency Medicine, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong,Seoul, Korea.Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its inhibitor plasminogen activatorinhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are established independent biomarkers for high metastasisrisk in breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the regulatory activity of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and its derivatives on uPA and PAI-1expression and thereby their anti-metastatic potential. EGCG showed only marginaleffects on the uPA system and on the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells(MDA-MB-231). However, the EGCG derivative 3e with a methyl-substituted carbonatesubstituent at the 4″-position showed potent inhibition of PAI-1 (62%) and uPA(50%) expression. The Ras-extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase(PI3K)/Akt/NF-κB pathways, which regulate uPA and PAI-1 expression, were alsoaffected by 3e (25%, 45%, and 25% reduction, respectively). In line with thesefindings, substantial reduction in metastatic behavior of MDA-MB-231 cells, such as adhesion (40%), invasion (56%), and migration (40%), was observed in thepresence of 3e. It is also noteworthy that, in MDA-MB-231 cells, 3e did not exertany beneficial effect on the expression of matric metalloprotein (MMP) 2 and 9,which indicates that the anti-metastatic activity of 3e in MDA-MB-231 cells isnot related to its regulation of the expression of MMPs. Taken together, we have shown that the EGCG derivative 3e could suppress the metastatic behavior ofMDA-MB-231 cells through regulation of uPA and PAI-1.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/ptr.6154 PMID: 30009577
