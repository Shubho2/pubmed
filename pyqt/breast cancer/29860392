The most common way to assess regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised,histopathologically processed, and examined by a pathologist. This tediousexamination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases beingmissed. However, recent advances in whole-slide imaging and machine learning haveopened an avenue for analysis of digitized lymph node sections with computeralgorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks, a type ofmachine-learning algorithm, can be used to automatically detect cancer metastasesin lymph nodes with high accuracy. To train machine-learning models, large,well-curated datasets are needed.Results: We released a dataset of 1,399 annotated whole-slide images (WSIs) oflymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in 3 terabytes of data in thecontext of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from five medical centers to cover a broad range of image appearance and stainingvariations. Each WSI has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains nometastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases, or isolated tumor cells.Furthermore, for 209 WSIs, detailed hand-drawn contours for all metastases areprovided. Last, open-source software tools to visualize and interact with thedata have been made available.Conclusions: A unique dataset of annotated, whole-slide digital histopathologyimages has been provided with high potential for re-use.DOI: 10.1093/gigascience/giy065 PMCID: PMC6007545PMID: 29860392
