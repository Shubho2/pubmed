The objective was to determine whether acancer diagnosis in patients with diabetes is associated with an increased riskof diabetic complications.Methods: This retrospective cohort study using health care data from Ontario,Canada, included persons age 50 years or older diagnosed with diabetes from 2007 to 2011 and followed until 2014. We examined the effects of cancer as atime-varying covariate: breast cancer (in women), prostate cancer (in men),colorectal cancer, and other cancers (in men and women). Each cancer exposure wascategorized as stage I-III, IV, or unknown, and by time since cancer diagnosis(0-1 year, >1-3 years, and >3 years). The primary outcome was hospital visits fordiabetic emergencies. Secondary outcomes were hospital visits for skin and softtissue infections and cardiovascular events.Results: Of 817 060 patients with diabetes (mean age = 64.9 +/- 10.7 years),there were 9759 (1.2%) colorectal and 45 705 (5.6%) other cancers, 6714 (1.7%)breast cancers among 384 257 women and 10 331 (2.4%) prostate cancers among 432803 men. For all cancers except stage I-III prostate cancer, rates of diabeticcomplications were significantly higher zero years to one year after diagnosiscompared with no cancer (adjusted relative rates ranging from 1.26, 95%confidence interval [CI] = 1.08 to 1.49, to 4.07, 95% CI = 3.80 to 4.36); thesedifferences were attenuated in the subsequent periods after cancer diagnosis.Conclusions: Patients with diabetes are at increased risk for preventablecomplications after a cancer diagnosis. Better diabetes care is needed duringthis vulnerable period.DOI: 10.1093/jncics/pky008 PMCID: PMC5954615PMID: 29795802
