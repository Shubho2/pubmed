Recent studies have shown that its expression is elevated in breastcancer and associated with more aggressive cancer types as well as poor outcomes.However, its cellular and molecular function is yet to be understood. Here weshow that silencing KIAA0100 by siRNA in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231significantly reduced the cancer cells' aggressive behavior, including cellaggregation, reattachment, cell metastasis and invasion. Most importantly,silencing the expression of KIAA0100 particularly sensitized the quiescent cancercells in suspension culture to anoikis. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometryand immunofluorescence analysis revealed that KIAA0100 may play multiple roles inthe cancer cells, including stabilizing microtubule structure as a microtubulebinding protein, and contributing to MDA-MB-231 cells Anoikis resistance by theinteraction with stress protein HSPA1A. Our study also implies that theinteraction between KIAA0100 and HSPA1A may be targeted for new drug development to specifically induce anoikis cell death in the cancer cell.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10060180 PMCID: PMC6025110PMID: 29867023
