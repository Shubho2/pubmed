Koch Center for Applied Genitourinary Cancers, The University ofTexas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.Cancer invasion programs are adaptive by switching between metastatic collective and single-cell dissemination, however current intravital microscopy models forepithelial cancer in mice fail to reliably recreate such invasion plasticity.Using image-guided microimplantation of breast cancer spheroids into the murinemammary fat pad and live-cell monitoring, we show microenvironmental conditionsand cytoskeletal adaptation during collective to single-cell transition in vivo. E-cadherin expressing 4T1 and E-cadherin negative MMT tumors both initiatedcollective invasion along stromal structures, reflecting invasion patterns in 3D organotypic culture and human primary ductal and lobular carcinoma. Collectively invading cells developed weakly oscillatory actin dynamics yet provided zones forsingle-cell transitions with accentuated, more chaotic actin fluctuations. Thisidentifies collective invasion in vivo as a dynamic niche and efficient sourcefor single-cell release.Â© 2018. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.DOI: 10.1242/dmm.034330 PMID: 29997220
