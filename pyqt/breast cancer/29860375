[Epub ahead of print]Defining Survivorship Trajectories Across Patients With Solid Tumors: AnEvidence-Based Approach.Dood RL(1), Zhao Y(2), Armbruster SD(1), Coleman RL(1), Tworoger S(3)(4), SoodAK(1), Baggerly KA(2).Author information: (1)Department of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine, The Universityof Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.(2)Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University ofTexas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.(3)Department of Cancer Epidemiology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.(4)Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston,Massachusetts.Importance: Survivorship involves a multidisciplinary approach to surveillanceand management of comorbidities and secondary cancers, overseen by oncologists,surgeons, and primary care physicians. Optimal timing and coordination of care,however, is unclear and often based on arbitrary 5-year cutoffs.Objective: To determine high- and low-risk periods for all tumor types that coulddefine when survivorship care might best be overseen by oncologists and when totransition to primary care physicians.Design, Setting, and Participants: In this pan-cancer, longitudinal,observational study, excess mortality hazard, calculated as an annualizedmortality risk above a baseline population, was plotted over time. The time this hazard took to stabilize defined a high-risk period. The percent moralityelevation above age- and sex-matched controls in the latter low-risk period wasreported as a mortality gap. The US population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database defined the cancer population, and the US Census lifetables defined controls. Incident cases of patients with cancer were separatedinto tumor types based on International Classification of Diseases for Oncologydefinitions.Exposures: Population-level data on incident cancer cases was compared with thegeneral US population.Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall mortality and cause of death were reported onobserved cancer cases.Results: A total of 2 317 185 patients (median age, 63 years; 49.8% female) with 66 primary tumor types were evaluated. High-risk surveillance period durationsranged from less than 1 year (breast, prostate, lip, ocular, and parathyroidcancers) up to 19 years (unspecified gastrointestinal cancers). The annualizedmortality gap, representing the excess mortality in the stable period, rangedfrom a median 0.26% to 9.33% excess annual mortality (thyroid and hypopharyngeal cancer populations, respectively). Cluster analysis produced 6 risk clustergroups: group 1, with median survival of 16.2 (5th to 95th percentile range [PR],10.7-40.2) years and median high-risk period of 2.5 (PR, 0-5.0) years; group 2,8.3 (PR, 5.1-23.3) and 2.5 (PR, 4.0-8.0) years; group 3, 2.8 (PR, 1.4-3.7) and7.0 (PR, 6.0-11.1) years; group 4, 1.6 (PR, 1.5-1.8) and 6.0 (PR, 5.1-11.4)years; group 5, 0.8 (PR, 0.5-1.2) and 0.8 (PR, 0.5-1.2) years; and group 6, 0.5(PR, 0.4-0.8) and 12.0 (PR, 9.3-12.9) years, respectively. Subanalyses ofselected tumor types in these groups revealed that stratifying on stage andhistologic type can change the risk cluster and guidance for care.Conclusions and Relevance: These findings indicate that a standardized 5-yearsurveillance period is inadequate for some cancers while excessive for others.High-risk cancers require the most resources with the longest high-risk period,highest persistent baseline mortality risk, and longest period of primary cancer mortality, all arguing for longer follow-up with an oncologist in these cancers.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.2761 PMID: 29860375
