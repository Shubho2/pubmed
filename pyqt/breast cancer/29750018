Optimizing combination regimens is vital toincrease therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effects.Materials and methods: In the present study, we evaluated the in vitrocytotoxicity of double and triple combinations consisting of1'S-1'-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA), Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) andcisplatin (CDDP) against 14 various human cancer cell lines to address the needfor more effective therapy. Our data show synergistic effects in MCF-7 cellstreated with MIP:ACA, MIP:CDDP and MIP:ACA:CDDP combinations. The type ofinteraction between MIP, ACA and CDDP was evaluated based on combination indexbeing <0.8 for synergistic effect. Identifying the mechanism of cell death based on previous studies involved intrinsic apoptosis and nuclear factor kappa B(NF-κB) and tested in Western blot analysis. Inactivation of NF-κB was confirmed by p65 and IκBα, while intrinsic apoptosis pathway activation was confirmed bycaspase-9 and Apaf-1 expression.Results: All combinations confirmed intrinsic apoptosis activation and NF-κBinactivation.Conclusion: Double and triple combination regimens that target induction of thesame death mechanism with reduced dosage of each drug could potentially beclinically beneficial in reducing dose-related toxicities.DOI: 10.2147/DDDT.S141925 PMCID: PMC5935191PMID: 29750018
