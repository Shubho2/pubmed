Breast, cervical,and ovarian cancer have the higher incidence and mortality among a series ofgynecology malignant tumor. We aimed to compare and assess the temporal trends ofcommon female malignances on breast, cervical, and ovarian cancer mortality indeveloped regions of Asia including Japan, Republic of Korea, and Singapore andanalyze the detached effects of chronological age, time period, and birth cohort by age-period-cohort (APC) analysis.Methods: The mortality data for these three cancers were collected from the WHOMortality Database in Japan, Republic of Korea, and Singapore from 1954 to 2013, from 1989 to 2013, and from 1964 to 2013, respectively. We fitted anage-period-cohort model and intrinsic estimator method to estimate theindependent effect of each age, time period, and birth cohort on cancer mortalityand describe the secular changes in three Asian countries.Results: For the overall trends of breast cancer, the ASMRs of breast cancershowed a general increasing trend among three countries during the study periods while the change pattern in Singapore was different from the rest of the twocountries for cervical and ovarian cancer. By APC analysis, the three cancermortality risks generally increased with age and decreased with birth cohort. Forperiod effects of breast and ovarian cancer, increasing effects with time wereobserved; however, for period effects of cervical cancer, converse change patternwas presented among three countries.Conclusions: Our study shows that the ASMRs of breast, cervical, and ovariancancer remain high in Singapore compared to Japan and Korea. Generally speaking, the mortality risk of three cancers increased with age, and period and cohorteffects may collectively affect the common female malignances mortality for East Asian women.DOI: 10.1155/2018/5307459 PMCID: PMC5884400PMID: 29750160
