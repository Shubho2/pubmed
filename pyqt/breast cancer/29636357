Usingpotent GR antagonists and primary tumor gene expression data, we sought toidentify a tumor-relevant gene signature based on GR activity that would be more predictive than GR expression alone.Experimental Design: Global gene expressionand GR ChIP-sequencing were performed to identify GR-regulated genes inhibited bytwo chemically distinct GR antagonists, mifepristone and CORT108297.Differentially expressed genes from MDA-MB-231 cells were cross-evaluated withsignificantly expressed genes in GR-high versus GR-low ER-negative primary breastcancers. The resulting subset of GR-targeted genes was analyzed in twoindependent ER-negative breast cancer cohorts to derive and then validate the GR activity signature (GRsig).Results: Gene expression pathway analysis ofglucocorticoid-regulated genes (inhibited by GR antagonism) revealed cellsurvival and invasion functions. GR ChIP-seq analysis demonstrated that GRantagonists decreased GR chromatin association for a subset of genes. A GRsigthat comprised n = 74 GR activation-associated genes (also reversed by GRantagonists) was derived from an adjuvant chemotherapy-treated Discovery cohortand found to predict probability of relapse in a separate Validation cohort (HR =1.9; P = 0.012).Conclusions: The GRsig discovered herein identifies high-riskER-negative/GR-positive breast cancers most likely to relapse despiteadministration of adjuvant chemotherapy. Because GR antagonism can reverseexpression of these genes, we propose that addition of a GR antagonist tochemotherapy may improve outcome for these high-risk patients.
