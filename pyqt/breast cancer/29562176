Electronic address: morag.park@mcgill.ca.Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) display a complex spectrum of mutationsand chromosomal aberrations. Chromosome 5q (5q) loss is detected in up to 70% of TNBCs, but little is known regarding the genetic drivers associated with thisevent. Here, we show somatic deletion of a region syntenic with human 5q33.2-35.3in a mouse model of TNBC. Mechanistically, we identify KIBRA as a major factorcontributing to the effects of 5q loss on tumor growth and metastaticprogression. Re-expression of KIBRA impairs metastasis in vivo and inhibitstumorsphere formation by TNBC cells in vitro. KIBRA functions co-operatively withthe protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN14 to trigger mechanotransduction-regulated signals that inhibit the nuclear localization of oncogenic transcriptionalco-activators YAP/TAZ. Our results argue that the selective advantage produced by5q loss involves reduced dosage of KIBRA, promoting oncogenic functioning ofYAP/TAZ in TNBC.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
