The present study aims to gain an overview ofpatients with abdominal-based free flap breast reconstructions in a long-termperspective.METHODS: Seventy-five patients who received abdominal-based free flap breastreconstructions between 2000-2007 in Uppsala, Sweden were invited back forphotographs, 3D imaging and questionnaires. A retrospective chart review wasconducted. Patient satisfaction with appearance and quality of life were assessedusing the Breast-Q questionnaire. A layman panel and a professional panel ratedthe aesthetic appearance of the reconstructed breast from photographs and 3Dimages.RESULTS: Fifty-five patients participated with a mean age of 52 ± 8 years at the time of reconstruction and a mean follow-up time of 11.4 ± 1.8 years completedthe study. The majority of the patients had received unilateral (85%), delayedreconstructions (73%) with prior radiation (55%). There were 53 patients withDIEP flaps, one with free TRAM flap and one with SIEA flap. Breast-Q scores inthe cohort were comparable to normative values of women without breast cancer(p < 0.001). There was a high level of agreement for the aesthetic results of thereconstructions between patient, professionals and layman panels (0.89 ICC, 95%CI: 0.83  - 0.93).CONCLUSION: Abdominal-based free flap reconstructions were effective in achievinga lasting positive aesthetic result and a high quality of life in patients adecade after surgery.Copyright © 2018.
