After explaining the physical principles, technical procedure and safety of US, information is given about its ability to make a correct diagnosis, depending on the setting in which it isapplied. The following definite indications for breast US in female subjects are proposed: palpable lump; axillary adenopathy; first diagnostic approach forclinical abnormalities under 40 and in pregnant or lactating women; suspiciousabnormalities at mammography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); suspiciousnipple discharge; recent nipple inversion; skin retraction; breast inflammation; abnormalities in the area of the surgical scar after breast conserving surgery ormastectomy; abnormalities in the presence of breast implants; screening high-riskwomen, especially when MRI is not performed; loco-regional staging of a knownbreast cancer, when MRI is not performed; guidance for percutaneous interventions(needle biopsy, pre-surgical localisation, fluid collection drainage); monitoringpatients with breast cancer receiving neo-adjuvant therapy, when MRI is notperformed. Possible indications such as supplemental screening after mammography for women aged 40-74 with dense breasts are also listed. Moreover, inappropriate indications include screening for breast cancer as a stand-alone alternative tomammography. The structure and organisation of the breast US report and ofclassification systems such as the BI-RADS and consequent managementrecommendations are illustrated. Information about additional or new UStechnologies (colour-Doppler, elastography, and automated whole breast US) isalso provided. Finally, five frequently asked questions are answered.TEACHINGPOINTS: • US is an established tool for suspected cancers at all ages and alsothe method of choice under 40. • For US-visible suspicious lesions, US-guidedbiopsy is preferred, even for palpable findings. • High-risk women can bescreened with US, especially when MRI cannot be performed. • Supplemental USincreases cancer detection but also false positives, biopsy rate and follow-upexams. • Breast US is inappropriate as a stand-alone screening method.DOI: 10.1007/s13244-018-0636-z PMID: 30094592
