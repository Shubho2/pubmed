Up untilabout 10 years ago (1967-2006), breast cancer diagnoses were communicated inperson more often than by telephone. Since 2006, more than half of participantslearned about their diagnosis over the telephone. From 2015 to 2017, almost 60%of participants learned about their diagnosis over the telephone. Among those whoheard the news in person, a steady 40% were alone. Characteristics of those whoreceived the news over the telephone included having identified support members, heterosexual identity, and a diagnosis of in situ breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Receiving a telephone call about breast cancer diagnosis may be the norm rather than the exception in health care today. Trends in practice, as well as current best practices based primarily on expert opinion, may not provideoptimal care for women diagnosed with breast cancer. Patient outcome research to guide future practice, such as the impact of modes of delivery of bad news, isurgently needed to determine appropriate patient-centered approaches fornotification of breast cancer diagnoses.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4383-y PMID: 30088139
