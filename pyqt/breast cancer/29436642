The present study investigated the combined effects of ruxolitiniband calcitriol on an estrogen receptor (ER)‑positive, human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 (HER2)‑positive, breast cancer cell line. The ER andHER2‑positive MCF7‑HER18 breast cancer cell line was used to investigate thecombination effect of ruxolitinib and calcitriol. A bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)assay was used to investigate cell growth inhibition. The synergism of thiscombination therapy was examined using the Chou‑Talalay method. Cell cycleanalysis was performed by flow cytometry, and apoptosis was evaluated by flowcytometry following Annexin V‑fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidiumiodide (PI) staining. Alterations in protein expression levels were analyzed bywestern blotting. The BrdU assay indicated that combination treatment usingruxolitinib and calcitriol produced a synergistic anti‑proliferative effect inMCF7‑HER18 breast cancer cells. Annexin V‑FITC/PI staining and cell cycleanalysis identified a synergistic increase in apoptosis and sub‑G1 arrest in the presence of ruxolitinib and calcitriol. Western blot analysis revealed that thesesynergistic effects of ruxolitinib and calcitriol were associated with reducedprotein levels of JAK2, phosphorylated JAK2, c‑Myc proto oncogene protein,cyclin‑D1, apoptosis regulator Bcl‑2 and Bcl‑2‑like protein 1, and with increasedlevels of caspase‑3 and Bcl‑2‑associated agonist of cell death proteins. Theresults of the present study demonstrated the synergistic anticancer effects ofruxolitinib and calcitriol in ER and HER2‑positive MCF7‑HER18 breast cancercells. Based on these findings, ruxolitinib and calcitriol may have potential as a combination therapy for patients with ER and HER2‑positive breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8580 PMCID: PMC5865997PMID: 29436642
