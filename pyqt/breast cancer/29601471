NPS induces protective, vaccine-like effects afterablation of orthotopic rat N1-S1 hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we review somegeneral concepts of NPS in the context of studies with mouse metastatic 4T1mammary cancer showing that the postablation, vaccine-like effect is initiated bydynamic, multilayered immune mechanisms. NPS eliminates primary 4T1 tumors byinducing immunogenic, caspase-independent programmed cell death (PCD). With lowerelectric fields, like those peripheral to the primary treatment zone, NPS canactivate dendritic cells (DCs). The activation of DCs by dead/dying cells leadsto increases in memory effector and central memory T-lymphocytes in the blood andspleen. NPS also eliminates immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironmentand blood. Finally, NPS treatment of 4T1 breast cancer exhibits an abscopaleffect and largely prevents spontaneous metastases to distant organs. NPS withfast rise-fall times and pulse durations near the plasma membrane charging timeconstant, which exhibits transient, high-frequency components (1/time = Hz),induce responses from mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus. Sucheffects may be responsible for release of danger-associated molecular patterns,including ATP, calreticulin, and high mobility group box 1 (HMBG1) from 4T1-Luccells to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). This likely leads to immunity andthe vaccine-like response. In this way, NPS acts as a unique onco-immunotherapyproviding distinct therapeutic advantages showing possible clinical utility forbreast cancers as well as for other malignancies.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10040097 PMCID: PMC5923352PMID: 29601471
