Assembly of the p53 expression vector as well asthat of a rat model with BC consisted of 200 successfully modeled rats randomlydivided into 5 groups: p53 gene introduction, p53 gene introduction + ultrasound irradiation, p53 gene introduction + UCAs, p53 geneintroduction + UCA + ultrasound irradiation, and UCA + ultrasound irradiationgroups. Expression of p53 was detected via quantitative real-time polymerasechain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. Inthe p53 gene introduction + ultrasound irradiation group, we observed increasedtumor volume with blood flow signals around and necrotic tumor tissues with aninhibition rate of 36.30%, as well as higher expression of p53 than that in thep53 gene introduction group and p53 gene introduction + UCA group. In the p53gene introduction + UCA + ultrasound irradiation group, tumor volume increasedslightly with reduced blood flow signals and massive degenerative necrosis oftumor cells was identified with inhibition rate of 62.62%, and expression of p53 was higher than that in the rest groups. Taken together, the key findingsobtained from the present study elucidate that injection of p53 gene and UCAmicrobubbles guided by ultrasound could increase the expression of p53, thusinhibiting the tumor growth in rats with BC.Copyright © 2018.
