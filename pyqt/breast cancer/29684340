[Epub ahead of print]Myeloid sarcoma with megakaryoblastic differentiation presenting as a breastmass.Obiorah IE(1), Ozdemirli M(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Medstar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington,D.C. 20007, United States.

The neoplasm can occur in any part of the body, includingthe bone, periosteum, lymph nodes, skin, and soft tissue and they may occur denovo or in association with acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndromes. Most cases display a myelomonocytic or puremonoblastic morphology. Tumors with megakaryoblastic differentiation areextremely uncommon and may occur in association with transformation of amyeloproliferative disorder. Myeloid sarcoma presenting as a breast mass is very rare and diagnostically challenging. We report a case of myeloid sarcoma withmegakaryoblastic differentiation in the breast of a patient with history ofessential thrombocythemia. The mass was composed of undifferentiated pleomorphic malignant cells in trabecular cords and nests with many scattered giant malignantcells and brisk abnormal mitoses. On immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cellswere positive for CD61, CD31, CD34, Factor VIII and CD43 which confirmed thediagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of myeloid sarcoma withmegakaryoblastic morphology occurring in the breast. Here we discuss theclinicopathologic features of this rare entity and the challenges involved inmaking this difficult diagnosis.Copyright Â© 2018 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.
