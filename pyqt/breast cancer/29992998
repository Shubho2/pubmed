The clinicaldata, including initial diagnosis and treatment of primary tumor, clinicalmanifestations, neuroimaging findings, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination,were analyzed. For the patients with adenocarcinoma/breast cancer, the incidence of cranial lesions and cranial nerve paralysis was obviously higher than patientswith small cell lung cancer. Whereas, the incidence of involvement ofintravertebral canal was obviously lower than that of small cell lung cancer.Patients with adenocarcinoma/breast cancer showed more incidence ofleptomeningeal enhancement compared to those with small cell lung cancer.Persistent severe headache was noticed in those with squamous carcinoma, andusually showed absence of abnormally LM-related neuroimaging and CSF cytological findings, which resulted in a challenge in the diagnosis of LM from squamouscarcinoma. Patients with different primary tumors showed differential clinicalfeatures. Significant differences were observed in clinical features betweenpatients with adenocarcinoma/breast cancer and small cell lung cancer. Our study contributes to the understanding of clinical characteristics of LM, andcontributes to improvement of LMÂ diagnosis in clinical practice.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-28662-w PMCID: PMC6041294PMID: 29992998
