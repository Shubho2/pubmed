[Epub ahead of print]Estimated Mortality of Breast Cancer Patients Based on Stage at Diagnosisand National Screening Guideline Categorization.Patel SB(1).Author information: (1)Elkhart General Hospital, Elkhart, Indiana. Electronic address:spatel@rad-inc.com.PURPOSE: To compare overall and stage I to IV mortalities of patients diagnosedwith breast cancer, calculated from stage at diagnosis using the Surveillance,Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database stage mortality estimates, whichare based on national screening guideline categorization.METHODS: From the stage at diagnosis of new breast cancer patients between 2010and 2014, percentages of invasive cancers, stage 0 + I of total cancers, andstage I of invasive cancers, were calculated. Five-year estimated overall andinvasive mortalities were calculated based on stage at diagnosis and SEERsurvival data. Program categories defined included an Annual Program, based onthe ACR (annual screening age 40 and above), a Biennial Program, based on the US Preventative Services Taskforce (biennial screening ages 50 to 74 years), and aHybrid Program, based on the American Cancer Society (annual screening ages 45 to54 years, then biennially at ages 55 and above), including respective intervalcancers.RESULTS: In all, 445 breast cancers met the study inclusion criteria. Comparingprogram categories, the Annual Program had the lowest percentage of invasivecancers (75.3%), highest percentages of stage 0 + I of total cancers (75.3%) and stage I of invasive cancers (67.1%), and the lowest 5-year estimated overall(10.1%) and stage I to IV (12.0%) mortalities. Estimated overall and stage I toIV mortalities for the Annual Program was 37.3% and 30.6% less, respectively,than the Biennial Program, and 31.8% and 26.8% less, respectively, than theHybrid Program.CONCLUSIONS: Based on stage at diagnosis, the greatest mortality reduction isachieved with mammography utilization starting at the age of 40.Copyright © 2018 American College of Radiology.
