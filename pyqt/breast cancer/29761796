MTT assay, cell apoptosis assay and cell cycle assay were carriedout to analyze the cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle respectively.Western blotting and qRT-PCR were applied for related protein and gene expressiondetection. RESULTS We found that the IC50 value of DDP (Cisplatin) to CHEK2 Y390Cexpressed MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly higher than that of the CHEK2 WTexpressed cells and the control cells. After treatment with DDP for 48 h, cellsexpressing CHEK2 WT showed lower cell viability than that of the CHEK2 Y390Cexpressed cells and the control cells; compared with the CHEK2 Y390C expressedcells and the control cells, cells expressing CHEK2 WT showed significant G1/Sarrest. Meanwhile, we found that compared with the CHEK2 Y390C expressed cellsand the control cells, cell apoptosis was significantly increased in CHEK2 WTexpressed cells. Moreover, our results suggested that cells expressing CHEK2 WTshowed higher level of p-CDC25A, p-p53, p21, Bax, PUMA, and Noxa than that of theCHEK2 Y390C expressed cells and the control cells. CONCLUSIONS Our findingsindicated that CHEK2 Y390C mutation induced the drug resistance of TNBC cells to chemotherapeutic drugs through administrating cell apoptosis and cell cyclearrest via regulating p53 activation and CHEK2-p53 apoptosis pathway.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.907256 PMCID: PMC5978023PMID: 29761796
