We conducted a pilot trial comparing outcomes for the three mostcommonly used chemotherapy regimens to assess the feasibility of conducting alarger definitive trial.METHODS: Using integrated consent, newly diagnosed TNBC patients were randomised to one of three standard regimens: dose-dense doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide thenpaclitaxel, doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide then weekly paclitaxel or5-FU-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide then docetaxel. Feasibility endpoints included; physician engagement, accrual rates, physician compliance and patientsatisfaction with the integrated consent model. Our anticipated pilot trialsample size was 35 randomised patients in one year.RESULTS: Between August 30th, 2016 and January 31st 2017, 2 patients meteligibility and were randomised. A survey of 10 participating oncologists wasperformed to identify potential strategies to enhance accrual. Most investigators(9/10) believed that the best regimen for TNBC was unknown, and 4/10 felt thiswas a pressing clinical question. Physicians' responses suggested that pooraccrual was due to: a lack of interest in some study arms as oncologists already had a preferred regimen (4/10) and concerns about trial demands in busy clinics(3/10). The pilot feasibility endpoints were not met and the study was closed.CONCLUSIONS: Despite initial interest in the trial question and multipleinvestigators agreeing to approach patients, this trial failed to meetfeasibility endpoints. The reasons for poor accrual were multiple and requirefurther evaluation if this important patient-centred question is to be answered.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02688803.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199297 PMCID: PMC6057636PMID: 30040817
