This strategy gives hope for the treatment of many severe diseases.Herein, we developed hybrid nanovectors able to deliver siRNA to triple negative breast cancer cells. The nanovectors are based on PEGylated superparamagneticiron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) functionalized with gH625 peptide, chitosan and poly-L-arginine. Every component has a key role and specific function: SPION isthe core scaffolding the nanovector; PEG participates in the colloidal stability and the immune stealthiness; gH625 peptide promotes the nanovectorinternalization into cancer cells; cationic polymers provide the siRNA protectionand favor siRNA endosomal escape and delivery to cytosol. The formulation wasoptimized by varying the amount of each compound. The efficacy of the siRNAretention and protection were investigated in the presence of high concentration of serum. Optimized nanovectors show a high uptake by MDA-MB-231 cells. Theresulting down regulation of GFP expression was 73 +/- 3% with our nanovectorcompared to 59 +/- 8% obtained with the siRNA-Oligofectamine™ complex in the sameconditions.Copyright © 2018.
