Despite this, the use of network analysis to study rural healthnetworks is limited. The purpose of this study was to use network analysis tounderstand how a network of rural breast cancer care providers deliver servicesand to demonstrate the value of this methodology in this research area.METHODS: Leaders at 47 Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural HealthClinics across 10 adjacent rural counties were asked where they refer patientsfor mammograms or breast biopsies. These clinics and the 22 referral providersthat respondents named comprised the network. The network was analyzedgraphically and statistically with exponential random graph modeling.FINDINGS: Most (96%, n = 45) of the clinics and referral sites (95%, n = 21) are connected to each other. Two clinics of the same type were 62% less likely torefer patients to the same providers as 2 clinics of different types (OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.29-0.50). Clinics in the same county have approximately 8 times higherodds of referring patients to the same providers compared to clinics in differentcounties (OR = 7.80, CI = 4.57-13.31).CONCLUSIONS: This study found that geographic location of resources is animportant factor in rural health care providers' referral decisions anddemonstrated the usefulness of network analysis for understanding rural healthnetworks. These results can be used to guide delivery of patient care andstrengthen the network by building resources that take location into account.Â© 2018 National Rural Health Association.DOI: 10.1111/jrh.12302 PMID: 29656463
