The current study analyzed the composition, incidence, mortality, andtemporal trends for some major cancer types among permanent residents in Luwandistrict of Shanghai from 2002 to 2011, so as to provide data for cancerresearch. Data were collected from the database of cancer registration andmanagement system in Shanghai. Number of new cases, number of deaths, incidence, and mortality of each cancer type were calculated. The incidence and mortalityrates were standardized. Temporal trends in the incidence and mortality wereassessed using average annual percent change. There were 12,843 new cancer cases and 8,331 deaths from cancer in Luwan from January 2002 to December 2011.Age-standardized incidence rates by Segi's standard were 229.46 and 205.05 per100,000 population for males and females, respectively. For males, the mostcommonly diagnosed cancers were lung, colorectal, stomach, liver, prostate,bladder, pancreas, kidney, lymphoma, and esophageal cancers; for females, theywere breast, colorectal, lung, stomach, thyroid, liver, ovary, pancreas, uterus, and brain cancers. The incidence rates for all cancers combined increasedsignificantly for both males and females from 2002 to 2011 (p < 0.05 for both).Age-standardized mortality rates were 147.04 and 90.62 per 100,000 population formales and females, respectively. The mortality rates have stayed stable duringthe 10-year period for both males and females (p > 0.05 for both). Our resultssuggest that cancer incidence and mortality rates in Luwan district of Shanghaivary by age, sex, tumor type. The increasing trends in cancer incidence call for effective prevention and control measures in the district. The significance ofcancer registration for disease surveillance and management needs to be furtheradvocated.DOI: 10.5582/ddt.2018.01009 PMID: 29681580
