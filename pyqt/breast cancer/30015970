China.The classical pathway involving receptor activator of nuclear factor‑κB (RANK)and its ligand (RANKL) induces the activation of osteoclasts and the migration ofa variety of tumor cells, including breast and lung cancer. In our previousstudy, the expression of RANK was identified on the surface of gastric cancercells, however, whether the RANKL/RANK pathway is involved in the regulation ofgastric cancer cell migration remains to be fully elucidated. Lipid raftsrepresent a major platform for the regulation of cancer signaling; however, theirinvolvement in RANKL‑induced migration remains to be elucidated. To investigatethe potential roles and mechanism of RANKL/RANK in gastric cancer migration andmetastasis, the present study examined the expression of RANK by western blotanalysis and the expression of caveolin‑1 (Cav‑1) in gastric cancer tissues byimmunohistochemistry, in addition to cell migration which is measured byTranswell migration assay. The aggregation of lipid reft was observed byfluorescence microscopy and western blotting was used to measure signalingchanges in associated pathways. The results showed that RANKL induced gastriccancer cell migration, accompanied by the activation of Cav‑1 and aggregation of lipid rafts. Nystatin, a lipid raft inhibitor, inhibited the activation of Cav‑1 and markedly reversed RANKL‑induced gastric cancer cell migration. TheRANKL‑induced activation of Cav‑1 has been shown to occur with the activation of proto‑oncogene tyrosine‑protein kinase Src (c‑Src). The c‑Src inhibitor, PP2,inhibited the activation of Cav‑1 and lipid raft aggregation, and reversedRANKL‑induced gastric cancer cell migration. Furthermore, it was demonstratedthat Cav‑1 was involved in RANKL‑induced cell migration in lung, renal and breastcancer cells. These results suggested that RANKL induced gastric cancer cellmigration, likely through mechanisms involving the c‑Src/Cav‑1 pathway and lipid raft aggregation.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6550 PMID: 30015970
