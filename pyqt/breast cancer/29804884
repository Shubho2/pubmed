[Epub ahead of print]Breast cancer screening in young women.Desreux JAC(1).Author information: (1)Department of Senology, CHU Liège, Avenue de l'Hôpital 1, 4000 Liège, Belgium.Electronic address: Joelle.desreux@chu.ulg.ac.be.Breast cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer in women aged less than 40.However, organized screening of young healthy women has been recognized asinefficient and even deleterious by most experts [1], and should not beenoffered. Individualized screening, targeting only some young high-risk women, maybe beneficial although no randomized trial has proven an impact on breast cancer mortality. All recommendations are based on expert's opinions. This review offersa toned overview of these recommendations and underlines the need of carefulinformation and shared decision with each patient.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
