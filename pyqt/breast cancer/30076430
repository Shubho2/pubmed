Simple descriptive statistics were performed torecord and tabulate the abdominal metastatic spread. Prognostic significance ofabdominal metastases and individual abdominal metastatic sites was studied using the Log-rank test and construction of Kaplan-Meier curves.RESULTS: The most frequent sites of intra-abdominal metastatic invasive lobularbreast cancer were peritoneum (55 patients, 47%), followed by liver (37 patients,32%), bowel (34 patients, 29%), ovary (33 patients, 28%), retroperitoneum (16patients, 14%), ureter (16 patients, 14%), and lymph nodes (15 patients, 13%).Bowel obstruction was noted in 15 patients (13%) and hydronephrosis in 25patients (22%). The median abdominal metastasis-free survival was 76 months(interquartile range: 17-191). The overall survival (OS) was 86 months(interquartile range: 49-188). Patients with abdominal metastases had shorter OS.Patients with hepatic metastases had shorter overall survival than those patientswithout hepatic metastases (p = 0.02, Log-Rank test).CONCLUSION: Invasive lobular breast cancer has a predilection for metastasizingto both typical (liver) and atypical intra-abdominal sites (peritoneum, GI tract,and adnexa). Presence of intra-abdominal disease and hepatic metastases inpatients with ILC negatively affects overall survival.DOI: 10.1007/s00261-018-1722-x PMID: 30076430
