We analyzed 8 tissuesamples containing invasive carcinoma that were surrounded by normal tissue and 3tissue samples with fibroadenoma only. We made various measurement sites onvarious tissue samples, in total 240 measurements for each type of tissue.Although the acquired raw spectra contain enough information to clearlydifferentiate between normal and tumor (fibroadenoma and invasive carcinoma)tissue, the differentiation between fibroadenoma and invasive carcinoma waspossible only after the shifted-excitation Raman difference spectroscopyisolation of pure Raman spectra from the heavily fluorescence interfered rawspectra. We used 784 and 785 nm as excitation wavelengths for theshifted-excitation Raman difference spectroscopy method. The differences in theobtained pure Raman spectra are assigned to the different chemical compositionsof normal breast tissue, fibroadenoma, and invasive breast carcinoma. Principalcomponent analysis and linear discriminant analysis showed excellentclassification results in the Raman shift range between 1000 and 1800 cm-1.Invasive breast carcinoma was identified with 99.15% sensitivity, and the absenceof invasive carcinoma was identified with 90.40% specificity. Tumor tissue intumor-containing tissue was identified with 100% sensitivity, and the absence of tumor in no-tumor containing tissue was identified with 100% specificity. As goldstandard for the determination of the sensitivity and the specificity, weconsidered the conventional histopathological classification. In summary,shifted-excitation Raman difference spectroscopy could be potentially very usefulto support histopathological diagnosis in breast pathology.DOI: 10.1177/1533033818782532 PMCID: PMC6048663PMID: 29991340
