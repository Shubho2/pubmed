Epidermal growth factorreceptor (EGFR) family signalling pathways play a key role in the regulation ofcell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Hence, anti-EGFR family mAbs isone of the most promising approaches in cancer therapy.KEY FINDINGS: Here, recent advances in anti-EGFR mAb including approved orsuccessfully tested in preclinical and clinical studies have been reviewed.Although we focus on monoclonal antibodies against the EGF receptor, but themechanisms underlying the effects of EGFR-specific mAb in cancer therapy, to someextend the resistance to existing anti-EGFR therapies and some therapeuticstrategies to overcome resistance such as combination of mAbs on differentpathways are briefly discussed as well.SUMMARY: The EGFR family receptors, is considered as an attractive target for mAbdevelopment to inhibit their consecutive activities in tumour growth andresistance. However, due to resistance mechanisms, the combination therapies may become a good candidate for targeting EGFR family receptors.Â© 2018 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.DOI: 10.1111/jphp.12911 PMID: 29574771
