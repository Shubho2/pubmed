Using antibodies that preferentially recognize theactive conformation of classical PKCs (cPKCs), we have previously shown that inbreast cancer samples the expression levels of cPKCs were similar in estrogenreceptor-positive (ER+ ) as compared to triple-negative tumors; however, thelevels of active cPKCs were different. Determining the activation status of PKCs and other kinases in tumors may thus aid therapeutic decisions. Further, in basicscience these tools may be used to understand the spatial and temporal dynamicsof PKC signaling under different stimuli and for co-immunoprecipitation studiesto detect binding partners and substrates of active cPKCs. In this article, wedescribe how monoclonal and polyclonal anti-active state PKC antibodies can beobtained using rational approaches to select bona fide epitopes throughinspection of the crystal structure of classical PKCs coupled to molecularmodeling studies. We believe that this methodology can be used for other kinases and multi-domain enzymes that undergo changes in their conformation uponactivation. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/cpch.42 PMID: 29927112
