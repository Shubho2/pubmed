Tumors that develop on the skin of the breast are often subject to a delayed diagnosis. Cytologicexamination provides excellent diagnostic capabilities and is a safe procedurewith a lower risk of local implantation, compared to needle or incisional biopsy.We herein report a patient who underwent surgical resection of a primarymalignant melanoma of the nipple. An elastic soft nodule was observed on the leftnipple, and no abnormal lesions were identified in the breast. Eventually, amalignant melanoma was diagnosed from the clinical and cytological evaluationfindings. This bulky tumor was classified as a stage IIIC nodular melanoma, with a thickness of 12 mm. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and exhibits no evidence of recurrence 7 years after surgery.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.1.96 PMCID: PMC5880972PMID: 29628990
