Optimal thresholds for discriminating betweencancer and control cohorts were identified for each metric and performancesummarized using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.RESULTS: Women who developed breast cancer exhibited greater BPE area (adjusted P= 0.004) and higher intensity statistics (adjusted P < 0.004, except skewness andkurtosis with P > 0.99) than did control subjects, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.75 to 0.78 at optimized thresholds.CONCLUSIONS: Elevated quantitative BPE parameters, related to both area andintensity of enhancement, are associated with breast cancer development.DOI: 10.1097/RCT.0000000000000774 PMID: 30052617
