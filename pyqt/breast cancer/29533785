Electronic address:hliang1@mdanderson.org.The functional impact of the vast majority of cancer somatic mutations remainsunknown, representing a critical knowledge gap for implementing precisiononcology. Here, we report the development of a moderate-throughput functionalgenomic platform consisting of efficient mutant generation, sensitive viabilityassays using two growth factor-dependent cell models, and functional proteomicprofiling of signaling effects for select aberrations. We apply the platform toannotate >1,000 genomic aberrations, including gene amplifications, pointmutations, indels, and gene fusions, potentially doubling the number of drivermutations characterized in clinically actionable genes. Further, the platform is sufficiently sensitive to identify weak drivers. Our data are accessible through a user-friendly, public data portal. Our study will facilitate biomarkerdiscovery, prediction algorithm improvement, and drug development.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
