Electronic address: weiw@seu.edu.cn.The cellular enzyme poly ADP (ADP: adenosine diphosphate)-ribose polymerase-1(PARP-1) plays key roles in DNA repair. Its activity is closely related tovarious cancer developments. Detection of PARP-1 activity is significant,however, it is relatively difficult since it lacks superiority property that can be used to detect conveniently. PARP-1 lead to the synthesis of hyperbranchedpoly (ADP-ribose) polymers (PAR) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)as substrate during DNA damage repairing. In this paper, we found thathyper-branched PAR increased the steric hindrance and reduced the flux of probeions effectively in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) nanochannels. To the best of our knowledge, few papers have been reported that hyper-branched polymer has thesimilar effects in nanochannels as G-quadruplex DNA. Thus, a novel and simplestrategy for PARP-1 detection has been proposed due to its great impacts on thediffusion flux of ferricyanide in AAO. It is also proved that electrostaticrepulsion is another important factor to influence the current. The method islabel-free, simple and sensitive. Quantitative detection of PARP-1 activity wasachieved with the detection limit of 0.006 U, which is lower or comparable to themost reported methods. The method has good accuracy and reproducibility. Thestrategy has been used to detect PARP-1 activity in real breast cancer cells and to evaluate PARP-1 inhibitors with satisfactory results, indicating that it is a potential powerful tool for clinical diagnosis and drug development in thefuture.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
