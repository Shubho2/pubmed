Targeted sequence capture and sequencing were performedfor 83 genes of importance in breast cancer.RESULTS: There were no significant case-control differences in mutation burdenoverall, for non-silent mutations, for individual genes, or with respect eitherto the nature of the gene mutations or to mutational enrichment at the pathwaylevel. For seven subjects with DNA from the BBD and ipsilateral IBC, virtually nomutations were shared.CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first to use a targeted multi-gene sequencingapproach on early breast cancer precursor lesions to investigate the genomicbasis of the disease, showed that somatic mutations detected in BBD tissue werenot associated with breast cancer risk.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0089-7 PMID: 29872146
