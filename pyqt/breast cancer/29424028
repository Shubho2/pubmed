One difficulty has been that measurement error in the exposure can lead to massive reductions in the power of the test, as well as in bias toward the null in the interaction effect estimates. Leveraging previous work on linear discriminant analysis, we develop a new test of interactionbetween genetic variants and a continuous exposure that mitigates thesedetrimental impacts of exposure measurement error in ExG testing by reversing therole of exposure and the diseases status in the fitted model, thus transformingthe analysis to standard linear regression. Through simulation studies, we showthat the proposed approach is valid in the presence of classical exposuremeasurement error as well as when there is correlation between the exposure andthe genetic variant. Simulations also demonstrated that the reverse test hasgreater power compared to logistic regression. Finally, we confirmed that ourapproach eliminates bias from exposure measurement error in estimation. Computingtimes are reduced by as much as fivefold in this new approach. For illustrativepurposes, we applied the new approach to an ExGWAS study of interactions withalcohol and body mass index among 1,145 cases with invasive breast cancer and1,142 controls from the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility study.© 2018 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.DOI: 10.1002/gepi.22113 PMCID: PMC5851866 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29424028
