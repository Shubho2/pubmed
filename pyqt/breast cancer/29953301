Findings were correlated with the diagnosis of the frozen section (FS)alone and the final diagnosis on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)material.RESULTS: The determination of the resection margin on TS was estimated asfeasible for all cases. Interobserver congruence rate for TS was 96% (κ = 0.81), which was lower compared with FFPE (100%, κ = 1.0) but superior to FS (89%, κ =0.67). Intraobserver congruence of the 2 reviewers was 96.5% and 93.0% between TSand FFPE, and 91.1% and 92.5% between FS and FFPE, respectively. The combination of both intraoperative consultation techniques showed similar congruence but aslight improvement for the sensitivity (0.75 to 0.875) for the diagnosis of tumorat the resection margin in FFPE for Reviewer 1 but was unchanged for Reviewer 2.CONCLUSION: The additional evaluation of TS can be a helpful additional tool for intraoperative margin assessment of breast cancer specimens, in particular, when processing artifacts of FS are encountered.DOI: 10.1177/1066896918780346 PMID: 29953301
