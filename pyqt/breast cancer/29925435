Herein, we raised the question of whether thecomposition of fresh and freeze/thawed dissociated tumor samples is comparable interms of quantitative and qualitative profiling.RESULTS: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, encompassing luminal A and B, basal/triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and ERBB2-like tumors. We examinedliving cells dissociated from TNBC and found that a classical freeze/thawprotocol leads to a marked reduction in the number of CD45-CD44LowCD24Low tumorcells. This, in turn, changed the percentage of tumor cells with certainCD44/CD24 expression patterns and changed the percentage of tumor-infiltratingimmune cells. These cryopreservation-driven alterations in cellular phenotypemake it impossible to compare fresh and frozen samples from the same patientdirectly. Moreover, the freeze/thaw process changed the transcriptomic signaturesof triple-negative cancer stem cells in such a manner that hierarchicalclustering no longer ranked them according to expected inter-individualdifferences. Overall, this study suggests that all analyses of living tumor cellsshould be conducted only using freshly dissociated tumors if we are to generate arobust scoring system for prognostic/predictive markers.DOI: 10.1186/s13104-018-3504-5 PMCID: PMC6011598PMID: 29925435
