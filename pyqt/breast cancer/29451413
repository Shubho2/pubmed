Using optimal cut-off valueat 220.94 according to Youden index, the sensitivity was 75.9%, specificity88.6%, positive likelihood ratio 6.681, negative likelihood ratio 0.272 andaccuracy 82.3%. The relative enhancement patterns of benign and malignantlesions, showing 29.92 vs 73.08% in the elevated pattern, 7.14 vs 92.86% in thesteady pattern, 5.71 vs 94.29% in the depressed pattern, and 80.00 vs 20.00% innon-enhanced lesions (p < 0.0001), respectively.CONCLUSION: Despite variations in the degree of tumour angiogenesis, quantitativeanalysis of the breast lesions on CESM documented the malignancies haddistinctive stronger enhancement and depressed relative enhancement patterns thanbenign lesions. Advances in knowledge: To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the feasibility of quantifying lesion enhancement on CESM. Thequantities of enhancement were informative for assessing breast lesions in which the malignancies had stronger enhancement and more relative depressed enhancementthan the benign lesions.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20170605 PMID: 29451413  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
