Here, we demonstrate thatthe p53-responsive lncRNA GUARDIN is important for maintaining genomic integrity under steady-state conditions and after exposure to exogenous genotoxic stress.GUARDIN is necessary for preventing chromosome end-to-end fusion throughmaintaining the expression of telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) bysequestering microRNA-23a. Moreover, GUARDIN also sustains breast cancer 1(BRCA1) stability by acting as an RNA scaffold to facilitate theheterodimerization of BRCA1 and BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1).As such, GUARDIN silencing triggered apoptosis and senescence, enhancedcytotoxicity of additional genotoxic stress and inhibited cancer xenograftgrowth. Thus, GUARDIN may constitute a target for cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1038/s41556-018-0066-7 PMID: 29593331
