The 3D spheroids were lesssensitive to these agents than the 2D cultured cells. Verapamil, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, partially enhanced the antiproliferative effects of the agents.DL-buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine significantly increased (p<0.05), whileN-acetyl-L-cysteine significantly inhibited the antiproliferative effects ofAs2S2 (p<0.003).CONCLUSION: The 3D spheroids showed less sensitivity to the antiprolliferativeefficacies of anticancer agents than the 2D cultured cells. P-Glycoprotein issuggested to be partially implicated in drug resistance. Reduction of cellularglutathione level enhanced the As2S2 cytotoxicity.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12450 PMID: 29599328  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
