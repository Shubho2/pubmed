However, controversy about the mechanisms involved inthe radiation response remains and the inherent intrinsic radioresistance of CSCshas also been questioned. These discrepancies observed in the literature arestrongly associated with the cell models used. In order to clarify thesecontradictory observations, we studied the radiosensitivity of breast CSCs using purified CD24-/low/CD44+ CSCs and their corresponding CD24+/CD44low non-stemcells. These cells were generated after induction of the epithelial-mesenchymaltransition (EMT) by transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) in immortalized humanmammary epithelial cells (HMLE). Consequently, these 2 cellular subpopulationshave an identical genetic background, their differences being related exclusivelyto TGFβ-induced cell reprogramming. We showed that mesenchymal CD24-/low/CD44+CSCs are more resistant to radiation compared with CD24+/CD44low parental cells. Cell cycle distribution and free radical scavengers, but not DNA repairefficiency, appeared to be intrinsic determinants of cellular radiosensitivity.Finally, for the first time, we showed that reduced radiation-induced activation of the death receptor pathways (FasL, TRAIL and TNF-α) at the transcriptionallevel was a key causal event in the radioresistance of CD24-/low/CD44+ cellsacquired during EMT.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25240 PMCID: PMC5955125PMID: 29805752
