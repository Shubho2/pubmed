We report the case of a 68-year-old female with breast cancer whounderwent a wide local excision and axillary clearance due to stage III breastcancer. Patient received post-operative whole breast irradiation therapy anddeveloped a painful, infected seroma one month after surgery. This was treatedwith antibiotic therapy after which the infection subsided. One year aftersurgery patient presented with a painful persisting seroma in the left axilla. Wedecided to surgically treat the seroma by removing the fibrous seroma capsula andclosing of the dead space with a latissimus dorsi flap. Six weeks after surgery, patient was pain and seroma free and was happy with the surgical result.Latissimus dorsi flap harvesting is an ideal way to treat persisting fibrousencapsulated seroma pockets after axillary clearance in the treatment of breastcancer.DOI: 10.1093/jscr/rjy032 PMCID: PMC5841370PMID: 29593862
