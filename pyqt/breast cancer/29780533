While chloride carriers have beenextensively investigated, the corresponding chloride channels have remainedlimitedly studied. Moreover, all hitherto reported channel systems lack clearlydefinable and readily modifiable positions in their structures for the reliableconstruction and combinatorial optimization of their ion transport properties. Asa result, the existing channels are limited by their large molecular weight, weakactivity or low anion selectivity. In this report, we describe a readilyaccessible and robust monopeptide-based scaffold for the reliable construction ofhalogen bond-mediated artificial anion channels via directional assembly ofelectron-deficient iodine atoms, which create a transmembrane pathway forfacilitating anion transport. The high intrinsic modularity of the backbone ofthe scaffold, which enables the rapid and combinatorial optimization of thetransport activity and selectivity of channels, effectively delivers a highlyactive chloride channel A10. Such high activity in chloride transportsubsequently leads to an excellent IC50 value of 20 Î¼M toward inhibiting thegrowth of human breast cancer cells (BT-474), an anticancer activity that is evenhigher than that of the well-known anticancer agent cisplatin.DOI: 10.1039/c8sc00602d PMCID: PMC5935034PMID: 29780533
