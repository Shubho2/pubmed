Our objective was to assess, for thefirst time, the clinical relevance of KLK6 mRNA expression in BC. Total RNA wasisolated from 165 breast tumors, as well as 100 adjacent non-cancerous tumorspecimens. After cDNA synthesis, and following quality control, quantitativereal-time PCR for KLK6 expression analysis took place. Receiver operatingcharacteristic curves were constructed in order to assess the ability of KLK6mRNA expression levels to differentiate between molecular BC subtypes. Survivalanalyses, using DFS as endpoint, were performed at the univariate andmultivariate levels. Publicly available BC databases and online survival analysistools were used to validate our findings. A significant downregulation of KLK6mRNA expression was observed in BC tissue sections compared to the non-cancerous component (P < 0.001). The expression of KLK6 is positively associated with tumorgrade (P = 0.038) and is overexpressed in TNBC and HER2-positive tumors(P < 0.001). Aberrant KLK6 expression predicts the clinical outcome of BCpatients in terms of DFS, independently of currently used prognostic markers(HR = 7.11, 95% CI = 1.19-42.45). The differential expression of KLK6 and itsassociation with unfavorable outcome in BC patients was validated via in silicoanalyses. Although an independent external cohort is necessary to confirm ourfindings, we proved for the first time that KLK6 can provide independentprognostic information for BC patients.DOI: 10.1007/s10238-018-0487-4 PMID: 29435805
