However, its possible role in lung cancer is unclear. In this study, we determined itscorrelation with lung cancer.Methods: Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to determine 40collected clinical lung cancer samples. Chi-square test was used to examinepossible correlations between ZWINT expression and clinicopathological factors.The prognostic significance of mRNA expression of ZWINT in lung cancer wasevaluated using the Kaplan-Meier plotter. Univariate and multivariate Coxproportional hazards regression analysis were performed to determine whetherZWINT is an independent risk factor for overall survival (OS) and disease-freesurvival (DFS) of lung cancer patients. Additionally, STRING database was used toanalyze protein-protein interactions.Results: In this study, we screened 13 GSE datasets and detected that ZWINT ishighly expressed in multiple carcinomas including lung, melanoma, prostate,nasopharyngeal, gastric, pancreatic, colon, esophageal, ovarian, renal, breastand liver cancer. Real-time PCR and IHC results of collected clinical lung cancersamples confirmed that ZWINT is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared withadjacent non-tumor tissues. Additionally, high expression of ZWINT might predict poor OS and DFS in lung cancer patients. Moreover, disease stage and expressionlevel of ZWINT were correlated with recurrence-free survival and OS in lungcancer. Analysis of protein-protein interaction based on STRING database gained 8top genes which could interact with ZWINT, including PMF1, MIS12, DSN1, ZW10,BUB1, BUB1B, CASC5, NDC80, NSL1 and NUF2.Conclusion: ZWINT is aberrantly highly expressed in lung tumor tissues and might be involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S149012 PMCID: PMC5870638PMID: 29615843
