Azole antifungal drugs were recently found to haveantitumor efficacy in several cancer types. They contain an imidazole(clotrimazole and ketoconazole) or a triazole (fluconazole and itraconazole)ring. Using human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), weevaluated the effects of azole drugs on cell proliferation, apoptosis, cellcycle, migration, and invasion, and investigated the underlying mechanisms.Clotrimazole and ketoconazole inhibited the proliferation of both cell lineswhile fluconazole and itraconazole did not. In addition, clotrimazole andketoconazole inhibited the motility of MDA-MB-231 cells and induced G1-phasearrest in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, as determined by cell cycle analysis andimmunoblot data. Moreover, Transwell invasion and gelatin zymography assaysrevealed that clotrimazole and ketoconazole suppressed invasiveness through theinhibition of matrix metalloproteinase 9 in MDA-MB-231 cells, although nosignificant changes in invasiveness were observed in MCF-7 cells. There were nosignificant changes in any of the observed parameters with fluconazole oritraconazole treatment in either breast cancer cell line. Taken together,imidazole antifungal drugs showed strong antitumor activity in breast cancercells through induction of apoptosis and G1 arrest in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cells and suppression of invasiveness via matrix metalloproteinase 9 inhibitionin MDA-MB-231 cells. Imidazole drugs have well-established pharmacokineticprofiles and known toxicity, which can make these generic drugs strong candidatesfor repositioning as antitumor therapies.DOI: 10.4062/biomolther.2018.042 PMID: 30092625
