Adual-functionalized graphene oxide (GO)-based nanocarrier with the conjugation ofaminated-polyethylene glycol (PEG-diamine) and octa-arginine (R8) for theintracellular delivery of nucleic acids is proposed. The functionalized sites arecovalently co-conjugated and the PEG : R8 molar ratio is optimized at 10 : 1 toachieve a hydrocolloidally stable size of 252 ± 2.0 nm with an effective chargeof +40.97 ± 1.05 and an amine-rich content of 10.87 ± 0.4 μmol g-1. The uptake ofthe nanocarrier in breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231, isinvestigated. The siRNA and pDNA condensation ability in the presence and absenceof enzymes and the endosomal buffering capacity, as well as the intracellularlocalization of the gene/nanocarrier complex are also evaluated. Furthermore, thedelivery of functional genes associated with the nanocarrier is assessed usingc-Myc protein knockdown and EGFP gene expression. The effective uptake of thenanocarrier by the cells shows superior cytocompatibility, and protects the siRNAand pDNA against enzyme degradation while inhibiting their migration with N : Pratios of 10 and 5, respectively. The co-conjugation of PEG-diamine and thecationic cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) into the GO nanocarrier also provides asuperior internalization efficacy of 85% in comparison with a commerciallyavailable transfection reagent. The c-Myc protein knockdown and EGFP expression, which are induced by the nanocarrier, confirm that the optimizedPEG-diamine/R8-functionalized GO could effectively deliver pDNA and siRNA intothe cells and interfere with gene expression.DOI: 10.1039/c8bm00058a PMID: 29757340
