Here, we use biological prior knowledge of family-to-family gene interactions available in the KEGG database to reveal individualgene-to-gene interaction networks that underlie the gene expression profiles of 2cell line data sets, sensitive and resistive to neoadjuvant docetaxel breastanticancer drug. Comparison of the topology of the 2 networks revealed that theresistant network is highly connected with 2 large domains of connectivity: onein which the RAF1 and MAP2K2 genes form hubs of connectivity and another in whichthe RAS gene is highly connected. On the contrary, the sensitive network ishighly disrupted with a lower degree of connectivity. We investigated theinteractions of the neoadjuvant docetaxel drug with the protein chains encoded bygene-gene interactions that underlie the disruption of the sensitive networktopology using protein-protein and drug-protein docking techniques. We found thatthe sensitive network is likely to be disrupted by interaction of the neoadjuvantdocetaxel drug with the DAXX and FGR1 proteins, which is consistent with theobserved accumulation of cytoplasmic DAXX and overexpression of FGR1 precursorsin cancer cell lines. This indicates that the DAXX and FGR1 proteins could bepotential targets for the neoadjuvant docetaxel drug. The work, therefore,provides a new route for understanding the effect of the drug mode of action fromthe viewpoint of the change in the topology of gene-gene regulatory networks and provides a new avenue for bridging the gap between gene-gene interactions andprotein-protein interactions which could have deep implications on mainstreamdrug development protocols.DOI: 10.1177/1176935118755354 PMCID: PMC5808968PMID: 29449773
