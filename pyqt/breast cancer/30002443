The potential involvement oflncRNAs in TNBC progression remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrated thatLINC01638 is highly expressed in TNBC tissues and cells. LINC01638 maintains the mesenchymal traits of TNBC cells, including an enriched epithelial-mesenchymaltransition (EMT) signature and cancer stem cell-like state. LINC01638 knockdownsuppresses tumor proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo.LINC01638 overexpression predicts a poor outcome of breast cancer patients.Mechanistically, LINC01638 interacts with c-Myc to prevent SPOP-mediated c-Mycubiquitination and degradation. C-Myc transcriptionally enhances MTDH(metadherin) expression and subsequently activates Twist1 expression to induceEMT. Our findings describe LINC01638-mediated signal transduction and highlightthe crucial role of LINC01638 in TNBC progression.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0396-8 PMID: 30002443
