[Epub ahead of print]Patterns of Distant Failure by Intrinsic Breast Cancer Subtype in PremenopausalWomen Treated With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.Kozak MM(1), Jacobson CE(1), von Eyben R(1), Walck E(2), Pollom EL(1), TelliM(3), Horst KC(4).Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.(2)Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.(3)Department of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Stanford CancerInstitute, Stanford, CA.(4)Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.Electronic address: kateh@stanford.edu.PURPOSE: To identify patterns of distant failure (DF) in premenopausal womenreceiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Premenopausal patients treated with NAC between 2005 and2015 at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Timing and locationof local, regional, and distant metastases were described. Predictors for DF and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.RESULTS: Of 225 patients, there were 24 (10.7%) local, 30 (13.3%) regional, and63 (28.0%) distant recurrences. Cumulative incidence of DF was higher in patientsyounger than age 40 (P = .01), in those with residual tumor size > 2 cm (P <.0001), in those with positive lymph nodes after NAC (P = .0003), and in thosewithout pathologic complete response (P < .0001). Cumulative incidence of brainmetastases was most common in patients with human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 (HER2)-positive disease (P = .05). Time from development of metastaticdisease to death varied by breast cancer subtype (P = .019), as did 5-year OS(P = .024). Women with HER2-positive and triple-negative disease had the highest incidence of brain metastases and the shortest time from development ofmetastases to death. On multivariable analysis, luminal B subtype (P = .025),pathologic complete response (P = .0014), young age (P = .0008), lack of hormone therapy (P < .0001), lymphovascular space involvement (P < .0001), and pathologicsize of the primary tumor (P < .0001) were all significant predictors for DF.CONCLUSION: Patterns of DF after NAC in premenopausal women vary by breast cancersubtype, with DF more common than locoregional failure. Young age remains anindependent poor prognostic factor, and OS differs by breast cancer subtype.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2018.04.020 PMID: 29843987
