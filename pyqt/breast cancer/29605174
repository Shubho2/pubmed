Because the absolute neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)is a significant prognostic factor for early-stage breast cancer, we investigatedits usefulness in terms of the eribulin or nab-paclitaxel treatment efficacy for MBC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 85 patients with MBC treated with eribulin (n = 59) or nab-paclitaxel (n = 26) were recruited. NLR values were collected atbaseline, after 1 cycle, after 2 cycles, and at the end of treatment. The NLRcutoff value was set at 3.RESULTS: The progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with an NLR < 3 atbaseline (median, 242 days; n = 24) was significantly better than that ofpatients with an NLR of ≥ 3 (median, 98 days; n = 35; hazard ratio, 0.37, 95%confidence interval, 0.18-0.71; P = .0032). Similarly, the overall survival wasmarginally significantly better in patients with an NLR < 3 who were treated witheribulin (P = .058). However, the NLR was not significantly associated with PFSor overall survival for patients treated with nab-paclitaxel. No significantassociation was found between the NLR during treatment and PFS in the eribulingroup. The significance of the NLR for the efficacy of eribulin was consistent,irrespective of estrogen receptor status, previous anthracycline or endocrineuse, and the number of previous chemotherapy regimens.CONCLUSION: A low NLR at baseline was significantly associated with improved PFS in patients treated with eribulin but not in those treated with nab-paclitaxel.Therefore, the baseline NLR might be clinically useful for selecting patients whowould benefit from eribulin.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
