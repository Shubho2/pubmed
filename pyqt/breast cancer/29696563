We sought to establish a mathematical prediction model that includedbreast cancer molecular subtype for risk of positive non-sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis and further validatethe model in a separate validation cohort.METHODS: We reviewed the clinicopathologic data of breast cancer patients withsentinel lymph node metastasis who underwent axillary lymph node dissectionbetween June 16, 2014 and November 16, 2017 at our hospital. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed and patients with pathologically proven sentinel lymph node metastasis underwent axillary lymph node dissection. Independent risks fornon-sentinel lymph node metastasis were assessed in a training cohort bymultivariate analysis and incorporated into a mathematical prediction model. The model was further validated in a separate validation cohort, and a nomogram wasdeveloped and evaluated for diagnostic performance in predicting the risk ofnon-sentinel lymph node metastasis. Moreover, we assessed the performance of fivedifferent models in predicting non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in trainingcohort.RESULTS: Totally, 495 cases were eligible for the study, including 291 patientsin the training cohort and 204 in the validation cohort. Non-sentinel lymph node metastasis was observed in 33.3% (97/291) patients in the training cohort. TheAUC of MSKCC, Tenon, MDA, Ljubljana, and Louisville models in training cohortwere 0.7613, 0.7142, 0.7076, 0.7483, and 0.671, respectively. Multivariateregression analysis indicated that tumor size (OR = 1.439; 95% CI 1.025-2.021;P = 0.036), sentinel lymph node macro-metastasis versus micro-metastasis(OR = 5.063; 95% CI 1.111-23.074; P = 0.036), the number of positive sentinellymph nodes (OR = 2.583, 95% CI 1.714-3.892; P < 0.001), and the number ofnegative sentinel lymph nodes (OR = 0.686, 95% CI 0.575-0.817; P < 0.001) wereindependent statistically significant predictors of non-sentinel lymph nodemetastasis. Furthermore, luminal B (OR = 3.311, 95% CI 1.593-6.884; P = 0.001)and HER2 overexpression (OR = 4.308, 95% CI 1.097-16.912; P = 0.036) wereindependent and statistically significant predictor of non-sentinel lymph nodemetastasis versus luminal A. A regression model based on the results ofmultivariate analysis was established to predict the risk of non-sentinel lymphnode metastasis, which had an AUC of 0.8188. The model was validated in thevalidation cohort and showed excellent diagnostic performance.CONCLUSIONS: The mathematical prediction model that incorporates five variablesincluding breast cancer molecular subtype demonstrates excellent diagnosticperformance in assessing the risk of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis insentinel lymph node-positive patients. The prediction model could be of helpsurgeons in evaluating the risk of non-sentinel lymph node involvement for breastcancer patients; however, the model requires further validation in prospectivestudies.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0863-7 PMID: 29696563
