They preferred the term'altered gene', valued a medical word definition function and warnings beforeaccessing sensitive information.CONCLUSION: Participants valued the decision support tool, the accessibility ofthe information and its clinical endorsement. The decision support tool hasconsiderable clinical utility as an adjunct to genetic counselling or for use in busy oncology clinics where formal genetic counselling may be unavailable.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4307-x PMID: 29955974
