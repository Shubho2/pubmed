However, theexperimental methods to identify associations between miRNAs and diseases remain costly and laborious. In this study, we developed a computational method namedNetwork Distance Analysis for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (NDAMDA) whichcould effectively predict potential miRNA-disease associations. The highlight of this method was the use of not only the direct network distance between 2 miRNAs (diseases) but also their respective mean network distances to all other miRNAs(diseases) in the network. The model's reliable performance was certified by the AUC of 0.8920 in global leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), 0.8062 in localLOOCV and the average AUCs of 0.8935 ± 0.0009 in fivefold cross-validation.Moreover, we applied NDAMDA to 3 different case studies to predict potentialmiRNAs related to breast neoplasms, lymphoma, oesophageal neoplasms, prostateneoplasms and hepatocellular carcinoma. Results showed that 86%, 72%, 86%, 86%and 84% of the top 50 predicted miRNAs were supported by experimental associationevidence. Therefore, NDAMDA is a reliable method for predicting disease-relatedmiRNAs.© 2018 The Authors.
