Email: manalsleem@yahoo.comObjective: The production of new natural pharmaceutical agents that increase the efficiency of chemotherapy without affecting the normal cells is the goal of all researchers. Therefore, the present study expects to evaluate the antioxidant andanticancer studies against MCF-7 cell lines of EPS produced by novel Egyptianmarine bacterial strain. Methods: Marine bacterium was isolated, purified andidentified by 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequence analyses. MHMEPS (theproduced EPS) was analyzed by Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR), monosugarsidentification by HPLC, molecular weight estimation and sulfur content weredetermined. While, in-vitro antioxidants characters was determined using various methods and anticancer studies against MCF-7 cell lines. Results: Bacillusvelezensis MHM3 produced 5.8 g/L of MHMEPS. The chemical analysis of MHMEPSshowed 24% uronic acid and 18.19% sulfate and monosugars glucuronic acid,glucose, fructose and rhamnose with molar ratio of 4.00: 2.00: 1.00: 0.13,correspondingly, with an overall weight average molecular weight Mw of 1.145×104 g/mol and the number average of molecular weights Mn of 5.155 ×103 g/mol. TheFTIR analysis and periodate oxidation indicate the existence of β-(1–4) linkageacidic polysaccharide. MHMEPS showed antioxidant scavenging activity againstDPPH•, H2O2 and Metal chelating activity, respectively. So, reducing power methodgive high activity at 500 μg/ml. MHMEPS hinder the proliferation of MCF-7 cellsat 5-80 μg/ml compared to the control group. Moreover, induced apoptosis wasassociated with activation of caspase-3. Also increased cytochrome C levelssignificantly in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control. The Caspase-3activity was raised in MHMEPS treated MCF-7 cells compared with the control(p<0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the result of DNA fragmentationwas confirmed by DNA ladder assay. We presume that MHMEPS has high potential atits low concentration, as a novel restorative agent for the treatment of MCF-7cells, with no cytotoxicity against normal cells.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.7.1957 PMID: 30051679
