Results from phase I of a phase I/II study in paediatric patients with recurrent/refractory solidtumours treated with nab-paclitaxel are reported.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with recurrent/refractory extracranial solidtumours received nab-paclitaxel on days 1, 8 and 15 every 4 weeks at 120, 150,180, 210, 240, or 270 mg/m2 (rolling-6 dose-escalation) to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D).RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were treated. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 dizziness at 120 mg/m2 and grade 4 neutropenia >7 days at 270 mg/m2. The mostfrequent grade 3/4 adverse events were haematologic, including neutropenia (36%),leukopenia (36%) and lymphopenia (25%). Although the MTD was not reached,270 mg/m2 was declared non-tolerable due to grade 3/4 toxicities during cycles1-2 (neutropenia, n = 5/7; skin toxicity, n = 2/7; peripheral neuropathy,n = 1/7). Of 58 efficacy-evaluable patients, complete response occurred in onepatient (2%; Ewing sarcoma) and partial responses in four patients (7%;rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, renal tumour with pulmonary metastases[high-grade, malignant] and sarcoma not otherwise specified); all responsesoccurred at ≥210 mg/m2. Thirteen patients (22%) had stable disease (5 lasting ≥16weeks) per RECIST.CONCLUSIONS: nab-Paclitaxel 240 mg/m2 qw3/4 (nearly double the adult recommended monotherapy dose for this schedule in metastatic breast cancer) was selected asthe RP2D based on the tolerability profile, pharmacokinetics and antitumouractivity. Phase II is currently enrolling patients with recurrent/refractoryneuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.
