Here, we report on the open-label,single-arm, phase IIIB 4EVER trial (NCT01626222). This trial evaluated theclinical effectiveness of everolimus plus exemestane in postmenopausal women withHR+, HER2- aBC who had progressed on or after an NSAI, but with no restrictionson the time of progression after NSAI, prior chemotherapy for advanced disease,or previous exemestane. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR; i.e.the percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete or partialresponse per RECIST 1.1) within the first 24 weeks of treatment. Secondaryendpoints included PFS, overall survival, safety, and health-related quality oflife. Between June 2012 and November 2013, 299 patients were enrolled at 82German centers: 281 patients were evaluable for efficacy and 299 for safety. The ORR was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.8-12.9%). Median PFS was 5.6 months(95% CI: 5.4-6.0 months). The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events werestomatitis (8.4%), general physical health deterioration (6.7%), dyspnea (4.7%), and anemia (4.3%). The ORR in 4EVER was lower than in BOLERO-2, likely due toinclusion of patients with more advanced disease and extensive pretreatment.These data confirm the clinical benefits and known safety profile of everolimusplus exemestane in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- aBC.
