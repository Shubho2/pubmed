There is a dearth of information regarding patients who have beendiagnosed with DCIS on core needle biopsy (CNB), who have no residual disease in the lumpectomy specimen. The purpose of this study was to explore the frequencyof this presentation and short-term outcomes in these patients.METHODS: Our institutional Breast Cancer Database was queried for all women whowere diagnosed with pure DCIS from 2010 to 2016 and treated with lumpectomy.Variables included patient and tumor characteristics, adjuvant treatment, andipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Statistical analyses includedPearson's chi-square, Fisher's exact tests, and Kaplan-Meier analysis.RESULTS: Of 547 patients with pure DCIS, 50 (14%) had DCIS on CNB only. Of thepatients with DCIS on CNB only, 15 were treated with lumpectomy and radiationtherapy (RT), while 35 underwent lumpectomy without RT. At a median follow-up of 4 years, there were 3 (6%) IBTR all within the same quadrant as the originallumpectomy site. None of the patients who recurred received adjuvant RT orhormonal therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the minimal extent of disease exhibited in these cases, 6%of patients with DCIS on CNB only had IBTR at a median follow-up of 4 years.These data suggest that even minimal DCIS represents a significant risk ofrecurrence to the patient. Size and margins are not sufficient criteria tostratify risk and guide decisions for adjuvant therapies.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13095 PMID: 30062749
