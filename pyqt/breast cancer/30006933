A comprehensive evaluation of the programwas conducted in 2016-2017 for quality assurance and mid-term course correction. The evaluation process involved: in-depth interviews of program managers; focusgroup discussions with service-providers of screening, diagnosis and treatment;supportive supervisory visits to randomly selected PHCs and diagnostic centers;desk review of the national guidelines and other published documents; andanalysis of the performance data compiled by the program-in-charge. We found thatthe program has strong political support, well-organized management structure anddocumented national policy and protocol. In absence of a mechanism to identifyand invite the eligible women individually, the program is opportunistic innature. Every PHC is provided with an annual target to be screened. A highlyvisible annual campaign to educate and motivate women has a major impact onparticipation. Record keeping and data collection are paper-based. In the years2015 and 2016, 1.1 million and 1.5 million women were screened respectively. Inthe year 2015, 62.8% of the annual target population was covered, CBE positivity was 3.2%, further assessment rate of screen positive women was 34.1% and thebreast cancer detection rate was 1.0/1000 women. Systematic paper-based datacollection enabled assessment of some of the process and outcome indicators. The screening coverage was moderate and cancer detection rate was low.
