[Epub ahead of print]Crucial role of CD69 in anti-tumor immunity through regulating the exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating T cells.Mita Y(1)(2), Kimura MY(1)(3), Hayashizaki K(1), Koyama-Nasu R(1), Ito T(1),Motohashi S(3), Okamoto Y(2), Nakayama T(1).Author information: (1)Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University,Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba, Japan.(2)Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Graduate School of Medicine, ChibaUniversity, Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba, Japan.(3)Department of Medical Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, ChibaUniversity, Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba, Japan.The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer treatment highlightsthe negative-regulation of anti-tumor immunity, such as effector T cellexhaustion in the tumor microenvironment. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction and prevention of T cell exhaustion remain largely unknown. We foundthat CD69, a type II glycoprotein known to regulate inflammation through T cellmigration and retention in tissues, plays an important role in inducing theexhaustion of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Cd69-/- mice showed reduced tumorgrowth and metastasis in a 4T1-luc2 murine breast cancer model, in whichincreased numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, relatively little T cellexhaustion, and enhanced IFNÎ³ production were observed. Anti-CD69 mAb treatmentattenuated the T cell exhaustion and tumor progression in tumor-bearing mice.These findings highlight a novel role of CD69 in controlling the tumor immuneescape mediated by T cell exhaustion and indicate that CD69 is a novel target forcancer immunotherapy.DOI: 10.1093/intimm/dxy050 PMID: 30085193
