Because ofits extremely low prevalence, screening and treatment guidelines are not wellestablished. Thus, analyzing cases of male breast cancer can accelerate thisprocess. We present a case of a 52-year-old man, initially diagnosed withbiopsy-confirmed intraductal papilloma without atypia, who presented 3 yearslater with progression of this benign lesion to ductal carcinoma in situ anddevelopment of de novo invasive ductal carcinoma. This report stresses theimportance of symptom detection and risk factor modification with the goal ofdecreasing the incidence of this disease.DOI: 10.1016/j.radcr.2018.02.021 PMCID: PMC6069683PMID: 30073044
