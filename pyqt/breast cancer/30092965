Cardiac magnetic resonancevariables were LV ejection fraction, normalized T2-weighted signal intensity for myocardial edema, extracellular volume (ECV), LV cardiomyocyte mass,intracellular water lifetime (τic; a marker of cardiomyocyte size), and lategadolinium enhancement.RESULTS: At baseline, patients had a relatively low (10-year) Framinghamcardiovascular event risk (median 5%), normal LV ejection fractions (mean 69.4 ± 3.6%), and normal LV mass index (51.4 ± 8.0 g/m2), a mean ECV of 0.32 ± 0.038,mean τic of 169 ± 69 ms, and no late gadolinium enhancement. At 351 to 700 daysafter anthracycline therapy (240 mg/m2), mean LV ejection fraction had declinedby 12% to 58 ± 6% (p < 0.001) and mean LV mass index by 19 g/m2 to 36 ± 6 g/m2(p < 0.001), and mean ECV had increased by 0.037 to 0.36 ± 0.04 (p = 0.004),while mean τic had decreased by 62 ms to 119 ± 54 ms (p = 0.004). Myocardialedema peaked at about 146 to 231 days (p < 0.001). LV mass index was associatedwith τic (β = 4.1 ± 1.5 g/m2 per 100-ms increase in τic, p = 0.007) but not with ECV. Cardiac troponin T (mean 4.6 ± 1.4 pg/ml at baseline) increasedsignificantly after anthracycline treatment (p < 0.001). Total LV cardiomyocytemass, estimated as: (1 - ECV) × LV mass, declined more rapidly afteranthracycline therapy, with peak cardiac troponin T >10 pg/ml. There was noevidence for any significant interaction between 10-year cardiovascular eventrisk and the effect of anthracycline therapy.CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in LV mass after anthracycline therapy may result fromcardiomyocyte atrophy, demonstrating that mechanisms other than interstitialfibrosis and edema can raise ECV. The loss of LV cardiomyocyte mass increasedwith the degree of cardiomyocyte injury, assessed by peak cardiac troponin Tafter anthracycline treatment.
