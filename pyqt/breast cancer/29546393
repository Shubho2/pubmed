Here, we found that the pan-caspaseinhibitor zVAD-fmk failed to inhibit bufalin-induced cell death in MCF-7 andMDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, confirming that the cell death induced bybufalin is caspase-independent. Instead, bufalin increased the expression of the necroptosis mediators RIP1 and RIP3. Bufalin-induced cell death was prevented by small molecule inhibitors of RIP1 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) or genetic knockdown of RIP3 by shRNA transfection. In addition, ectopic RIP3expression enhanced cell death by bufalin. We also found that bufalin increasedintracellular reactive oxygen species levels; and cell death by bufalin wasinhibited by the antioxidant NAC. In a mouse xenograft model of human breastcancer, bufalin induced PARP-1-dependent tumor cell death and inhibited tumorgrowth. These results demonstrated that bufalin inhibits human breast cancertumorigenesis by inducing cell death through the reactive oxygen species-mediatedRIP1/RIP3/PARP-1 pathways.DOI: 10.1093/carcin/bgy039 PMID: 29546393
