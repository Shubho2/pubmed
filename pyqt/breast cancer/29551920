The method ofimmunohistochemical is utilized to test the expression of CXCR7 and NF-κB in the breast cancer tissue, compared with the para-carcinoma tissue, and analyze itsrelevance with the clinicopathologic features of the breast cancer tissue, suchas tumor size, TNM staging, lymphatic metastasis and other conditions.RESULTS: both CXCR7 and NF-κB were highly expressed in the breast cancer tissue, the positive rate was significantly higher that that of paracancerous normaltissues, and the difference was statistically significant. And the expressions ofCXCR7 and NF-κB were related to TNM staging of the breast cancer and lymphaticmetastasis and unrelated to the tumor size, age, and expressions of ER, PR andHER2.CONCLUSION: both CXCR7 and NF-κB are related to the malignant grade of the breastcancer and lymphatic metastasis, which may be regarded as in important indicator to judge the prognosis of the breast cancer and be expected to be the new target of curing part of the breast cancer.DOI: 10.1016/j.sjbs.2017.11.009 PMCID: PMC5851893PMID: 29551920
