Electronic address:o.a.olajide@hud.ac.uk.Formononetin is a bioactive non-steroidal polyphenol found in a variety ofplants. In this study we evaluated the effects of formononetin onneuroinflammation in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia. Results showed thatformononetin significantly reduced the production of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β,nitrite and PGE2, as well as protein levels of iNOS and COX-2. Reporter geneassays showed that formononetin produced inhibition of NF-κB luciferase activity in HEK293 cells stimulated with TNF-α. Immunoblotting experiments revealed aninhibition of IKKα phosphorylation, with the resultant attenuation ofphosphorylation and degradation of IκBα following LPS stimulation. Formononetinalso produced an inhibition of nuclear translocation and DNA binding by NF-κBfollowing LPS stimulation. RNAi experiments showed that transfection of BV2microglia with ERβ siRNA resulted in the loss of anti-inflammatory action offormononetin. MTT assay and MAP2 immunoreactivity experiments showed thatformononetin produced significant neuroprotective activity by preventing BV2microglia conditioned media-induced toxicity to HT22 neurons. Investigations onthe effect of formononetin on MCF7 breast cancer cells revealed that, while thecompound significantly increased ER-luciferase activity, its effects onproliferation were modest. This study has established that formononetin inhibits neuroinflammation by targeting NF-κB signalling pathway in BV2 microglia,possibly through mechanisms involving ERβ. Formononetin appears to modulate ERβin MCF7 breast cancer cells with limited proliferative effect. Formononetin couldtherefore serve as a chemical scaffold for the development of novel compoundswhich have selective neuroprotective actions in the brain.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
