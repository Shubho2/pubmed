It is also theforemost reason for cancer-related mortality in Hispanic females in the UnitedStates (US). Although the current incidence of breast cancer is significantlylower in Hispanics compared to that of non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) and Blacks,(91.9, 128.1, and 124.3 per 100,000, respectively, annually), this may increaseif Hispanics develop similar lifestyle behaviors to other American women, incategories such as weight management, age at first birth, number of children, andbreastfeeding habits. Stage-for-stage mortality for Hispanics is similar to NHWs,but the mortality rate is not declining as rapidly in this ethnic group. Hispanicwomen share many of the same risk factors for developing breast cancer as NHWsand Blacks. This suggests that many of the risk reduction strategies used inother racial populations may also benefit this group. Providing education aboutbreast cancer and implementing risk reduction strategies in culturally-awareenvironments could help keep incidence low and reduce cancer-related mortality.Since Hispanics are the largest minority group in the US, this could have asignificant impact on the incidence and mortality nationally.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2235 PMCID: PMC5919763PMID: 29713580
