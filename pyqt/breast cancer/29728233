Developing new strategies to promote the therapeuticefficacy while reducing toxic side effects of chemo-radiotherapy is a mainresearch objective in cancer therapy. A promising new oncological strategy forenhancing chemo-radiotherapy against cancer involves the utilization ofmultifunctional nanoparticles (nanocarriers and radiosensitizers). In this work, Chitosan-Capped Gold Nanoparticles (CS-GNPs) were synthesized and loaded with an anticancer agent, Doxorubicin (CS-GNPs-DOX). The prepared multifunctionalnano-formulation acted as nano-radiosensitizer, in addition to being an intrinsicdrug delivery system allowing efficient loading and targeting ofchemotherapeutics. The therapeutic efficacy of CS-GNPs-DOX was studied bytreating breast cancer cells (MCF-7) with CS-GNPs-DOX accompanied by differentdoses of X-rays (0.5, 1 and 3 Gy) and assessing the cytotoxic effect via neutral red cell viability assay. Further assessment of the therapeutic efficacy wasconducted using flowcytometry to measure the induction of apoptosis, whileneutral comet assay was carried out to check DNA double strand breaks. Resultsshowed that CS-GNPs-DOX could enhance the chemo-radiotherapeutic effect bysignificantly decreasing cancer cells viability with increasing DNA double strandbreaks and inducing cell necrosis even at a very low radiation dose (0.5 Gy).Interestingly, the developed multifunctional CS-GNPs-DOX provided a synergisticregimen for cancer treatment that effectively delivered DOX to tumor cells andenhanced the radiosensitization activity, thus minimizing conventionalradio-therapeutic required doses. Accordingly, CS-GNPs-DOX represents a promisingmultifunctional nanoparticle for enhancing breast cancer chemo-radiotherapy.Copyright © 2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.
