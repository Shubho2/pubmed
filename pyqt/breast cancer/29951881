The effects of miR-1301-3p on BCcell growth, proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis were alsoexplored in vitro using MTT, colony formation and Flow cytometry assays. Thepotential target gene of miR-1301-3p was determined by dual-luciferase reporterassay and verified by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis.RESULTS: We found the expression of miR-1301-3p was observably significantlydown-regulated in BC tissues and cell lines. MiR-1301-3p expression in BC tissueswas significantly associated with tumor size and clinical stage. Gain-of-functionassays demonstrated that miR-1301-3p inhibited the cell growth and proliferation in breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and T-47D. Moreover, up-regulation ofmiR-1301-3p induced cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically,up-regulation of miR-1301-3p reduced the expression of CDK4, Cyclin D1, Bcl-2,but elevated the expression of p21, Bad and Bax. ICT1 was confirmed as a directtarget of miR-1301-3p. Furthermore, ICT1 overexpression could partially reversethe effects of miR-1301-3p on BC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression andapoptosis.CONCLUSION: Our observations suggested that miR-1301-3p inhibits cellproliferation via inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through targetingICT1, and might be a therapeutic target for BC.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0881-5 PMID: 29951881
