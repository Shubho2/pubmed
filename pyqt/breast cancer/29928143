Metastasis requires the orchestration of homeostatic factors andcellular programs, many of which are potential therapeutic targets. Luteolin(2-[3,4-dihydroxyphenyl]-5,7-dihydroxy-4-chromenone), is a naturally occurringflavonoid found in fruits and vegetables that exhibits many anticancerproperties. Luteolin obstructs metastasis through both direct and indirectmechanisms. For instance, luteolin may suppress breast cancer invasion by acting as an antiangiogenic therapeutic inhibiting VEGF production and its receptor'sactivity. Furthermore, luteolin decreases epithelial-mesenchymal transitionmarkers and metastatic proclivity. Luteolin also acts as an antiproliferative by suppressing receptor tyrosine-kinase activity and apoptosis, both of which could prevent incipient colonization of breast cancer. Many of these antimetastaticcharacteristics accredited to luteolin are likely functionally related. Forinstance, the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is impeded by luteolin, has severaldownstream programs involved in increased proliferation, survival, and metastaticpotential in breast cancer. In this review, luteolin's ability to amelioratebreast cancer is summarized. The paper also offers insight into the molecularmechanisms by which luteolin may suppress breast cancer metastasis.DOI: 10.2147/BCTT.S144202 PMCID: PMC6003288PMID: 29928143
