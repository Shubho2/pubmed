Notably, there are two described forms of hypoxia present in agrowing tumor: chronic hypoxia, caused by abnormal tumor vasculature, andintermittent hypoxia, caused by transient perfusion facilitated bytumor-supplying blood vessels. Here, we demonstrate that intermittent hypoxia,but not chronic hypoxia, endows breast cancer cells with greater metastaticpotential. Using an immunocompetent and syngeneic murine model of breast cancer, we show that intermittent hypoxia enhances metastatic seeding and outgrowth inlungs in vivo. Furthermore, exposing mammary tumor cells to intermittent hypoxia promoted clonal diversity, upregulated metastasis-associated gene expression,induced a pro-tumorigenic secretory profile, increased stem-like cell markerexpression, and gave rise to tumor-initiating cells at a relatively higherfrequency. This work demonstrates that intermittent hypoxia, but not chronichypoxia, induces a number of genetic, molecular, biochemical, and cellularchanges that facilitate tumor cell survival, colonization, and the creation of a permissive microenvironment and thus enhances metastatic growth.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0259-3 PMID: 29713057
