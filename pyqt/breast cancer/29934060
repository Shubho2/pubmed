Wecompared the risk of SCs in HL patients relative to the risk in the US generalpopulation across 3 periods: 1973 to 1986, 1987 to 2000, and 2001 to 2014 tostudy the effect of treatment practices on the development of SCs.RESULTS: In a follow-up study of 23,864 HL survivors for 284,730 person-years,3260 SCs were diagnosed with a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.97 (95%confidence interval [CI], 1.9-2.04). A statistically significant decrease wasfound in the overall SIRs of SCs diagnosed in HL patients from 1987 to 2000 (SIR,1.82; 95% CI, 1.72-1.93) and from 2001 to 2014 (SIR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.51-1.82)relative to patients with SCs diagnosed from 1973 to 1986 (SIR, 2.24; 95% CI,2.13-2.35). The decline in the overall SIR mostly resulted from declines indigestive tract and breast cancers. The SIRs of most other solid tumors andhematologic malignancies did not decrease. After adjusting for age, gender, andrace, patients with a diagnosis from 1973 to 1986 had a 12% greater risk ofdeveloping SCs (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03-1.23; P = .01) compared with thepatients with a diagnosis from 1987 to 2000.CONCLUSION: Although the overall risk of SCs in patients with HL declined aftermodifications in HL treatment, the risk did not change significantly at mostindividual sites. Thus, close follow-up with active surveillance for SCs iscrucial for long-term survivors of HL.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.clml.2018.05.021 PMID: 29934060
