With HIFU, an ultrasound (US) beam propagates through soft tissue as a high-frequencypressure wave. The US beam is focused at a small target volume, and due to theenergy building up at this site, the temperature rises, causing coagulativenecrosis and protein denaturation within a few seconds. HIFU is capable ofproviding a completely non-invasive treatment without causing damage to thedirectly adjacent tissues. HIFU can be either guided by US or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Guided imaging is used to plan the treatment, detect any movement during the treatment and monitor response in real-time. This review describes thehistory of HIFU, the HIFU technique, available devices and gives an overview ofthe published literature in the treatment of benign and malignant breast tumours with HIFU.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.794 PMCID: PMC5804717PMID: 29434660
