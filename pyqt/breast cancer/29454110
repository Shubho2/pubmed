Malignant breast tissues of patients were characterized intodifferent subtypes based on the differences in the expression of hormonereceptors and the FF was calculated. Further, the sensitivity and specificity of FF to differentiate malignant from benign and from normal breast tissues ofhealthy volunteers was determined using receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis.RESULTS: A significantly lower FF of malignant (median 0.12; range 0.01-0.70)compared to benign lesions (median 0.28; range 0.02-0.71) and normal breasttissue of healthy volunteers (median 0.39; range 0.06-0.76) was observed. Nosignificant difference in FF was seen between benign lesions and normal breasttissues of healthy volunteers. Sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 68.6%,respectively was obtained to differentiate malignant from benign lesions. For thedifferentiation of malignant from healthy breast tissues, 76% sensitivity and74.5% specificity was achieved. Higher FF was seen in patients with ER-/PR-status as compared to ER+/PR+ patients. Similarly, FF of HER2neu+ tumors weresignificantly higher than in HER2neu- breast tumors.CONCLUSION: The results showed the potential of in vivo 1H MRS in providinginsight into the changes in the fat content of different types of breast tissues and in various breast tumor subtypes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
