To obtain an optimal cut-off valueof the strain ratio for differentiating between malignant and benign breastlesions, RTE findings were compared with histopathology of core needle biopsysamples or with ultrasound follow-up data of the analyzed masses.Results: Seventy-nine breast lesions [BI-RADS category 3 (n=15), BI-RADS category4 (n=34), and BI-RADS category 5 (n=30)] were classified as malignant (n=36) orbenign (n=43). The mean strain index value was 6.59±3.44 (range 0.6-14) formalignant lesions and 2.79±2.16 (range 0.6-8.7) for benign lesions, respectively (p<0.05). As regards the detection of malignant lesions, US was characterized by sensitivity and specificity of 100% (CI 95%; 88-100) and 90% (CI 95%; 76-97),respectively. When an optimal value of the strain ratio (4.25) was obtained byROC curve analysis, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing malignantlesions were 86% (CI 95%; 70-95) and 76% (CI 95%; 60-87), respectively.Conclusions: RTE can play an important role in the differentiation betweenmalignant and benign breast masses, but it should be used in conjunction withultrasonography.DOI: 10.12659/PJR.902596 PMCID: PMC5894028PMID: 29657632
