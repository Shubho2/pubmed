[Epub ahead ofprint]TRIM14 promotes breast cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting apoptosis.Hu G(1), Pen W(1), Wang M(1).Author information: (1)Department of General Surgery, Shanghai Traditional ChineseMedicine-Integrated Hospital, Shanghai, 201203, PR China.Tripartite motif-containing 14 (TRIM14) abnormally expressed in several humancancers. However, the function and expression of TRIM14 in human breast cancerwere still largely unknown. To understand biological function of TRIM14 in breastcancer, we measured expression level of TRIM14. Cell proliferation and cellapoptosis were measured after TRIM14 overexpression or knockdown. Theupregulation of TRIM14 was found in human breast cancer specimens and cell lines.Deduction of TRIM14 inhibited cell proliferation but increased cell apoptosis in BT474 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Further study showed that knockdown of TRIM14up-regulated the expression of BAX, while down-regulated the expression of BCL2. Meanwhile the expression of SHP-1 was increased and the phosphorylation of STAT3 (p-STAT3) was inhibited. Conversely, overexpression of TRIM14 had the oppositeeffects. Additional, Cryptotanshinone, a STAT3 inhibitor, inhibited cellproliferation but increased cell apoptosis in BT474 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Inconclusion, TRIM14 may act as oncogene in human breast cancer and may be a novel strategy for human breast cancer.DOI: 10.3727/096504018X15214994641786 PMID: 29562956
