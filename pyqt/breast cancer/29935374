Cancer stem cells (CSCs) and dense/stiff extracellularmatrices are implicated in aggression and therapy resistance. We examined thisinterplay and response to mTOR inhibition using ERα+ adenocarcinomas from NRL-PRLfemales in combination with Col1a1tmJae/+ (mCol1a1) mice, which accumulatecollagen-I around growing tumors. Orthotopic transplantation of tumor cells tomCol1a1 but not wildtype hosts resulted in striking desmoplasia. Mammary tumorsin mCol1a1 recipients displayed higher CSC activity and enhanced AKT-mTOR and YAPactivation, and these animals developed more and larger lung metastases.Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, with or without the anti-estrogen, ICI182780, rapidly diminished mammary tumors, which rapidly reversed whentreatment ceased. In contrast, lung metastases, which exhibited lowerproliferation and pS6RP, indicating lower mTOR activity, were unresponsive, andmCol1a1 hosts continued to sustain greater metastatic burdens. These findingsshed light on the influence of desmoplastic tumor microenvironments on the CSCniche and metastatic behavior in ERα+ breast cancer. The differential mTORdependence of local mammary tumors and pulmonary lesions has implications forsuccess of mTOR inhibitors in advanced ERα+ disease.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
