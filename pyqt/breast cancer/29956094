This study was designed to identify transcriptomic and epigenomicsignatures of breast cancer (BC) tumors from patients with any prior malignancy.METHODS: RNA-sequencing and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from BCs weregenerated in the Cancer Genome Atlas project. Patients with secondary breastcancer (SBC) were separated by histological subtype and matched to primary breastcancer controls to create two independent cohorts of invasive ductal (IDC,n = 36) and invasive lobular (ILC, n = 40) carcinoma. Differentially expressedgenes, as well as differentially methylated genomic regions, were integrated toidentify epigenetically regulated abnormal gene pathways in SBCs.RESULTS: Differentially expressed genes were identified in IDC SBCs (n = 727) andin ILC SBCs (n = 261; Wilcoxon's test; P < 0.05). In IDC SBCs, 105 genes wereupregulated and hypomethylated, including an estrogen receptor gene, and 73 geneswere downregulated and hypermethylated, including genes involved in antigenpresentation and interferon response pathways (HLA-E, IRF8, and RELA). In ILCSBCs, however, only 17 genes were synchronously hypomethylated and upregulated,whereas 46 genes hypermethylated and downregulated. Interestingly, the SBC geneexpression signatures closely corresponded with each histological subtype withonly 1.51% of genes overlapping between the two histological subtypes.CONCLUSIONS: Differential gene expression and DNA methylation signatures are seenin both IDC and ILC SBCs, including genes that are relevant to tumor growth andproliferation. Differences in gene expression signatures corresponding with each histological subtype emphasize the importance of disease subtype-specificevaluations of molecular alterations.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6582-7 PMID: 29956094
