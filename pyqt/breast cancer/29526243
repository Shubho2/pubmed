A limited range of proven interventions has been developed to targetsuch side effects. While Tai Chi offers benefits for the health and well-being ofbreast cancer survivors, the effectiveness of Tai Chi across the treatmentcontinuum has not been evaluated. Improved patient education and support has beensuggested as a priority for breast cancer care. This pilot study assesses thefeasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of "an integrative Tai Chi" (ANITA) program for breast cancer patients undergoingcancer therapy.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a single-centre, two-arm feasibility RCT. Twenty-fourpatients with breast cancer who have undergone surgical treatment will berecruited from the Dunedin Hospital (New Zealand) over a 12-month period (fromAugust 2017 to July 2018). Subject to informed consent, patients will berandomized to receive standard cancer treatment alone or standard cancertreatment plus the ANITA program, consisting of peer support, health education,and Tai Chi Ruler exercise. The program runs alongside the patient's adjuvantcancer therapy, which may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, antibodytreatment, and/or antihormonal therapy. Analysis in this study will focus onprocess evaluation of participant recruitment, retention, treatment fidelity,acceptability of the program, and occurrence of adverse events. Clinical outcomes(i.e., fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety and depression and quality of life) willbe assessed at baseline, and at 12 weeks and 24 weeks post-randomization.DISCUSSION: Outcomes from this study will inform the feasibility and methodology for a future fully-powered RCT.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry with theidentifier ACTRN12617000975392.Copyright © 2018 Shanghai Changhai Hospital.
