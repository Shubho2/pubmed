[Epub ahead ofprint]Kaempferol suppresses proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, andDNA damage in breast cancer cells.Zhu L(1), Xue L(2).Author information: (1)Department of Medical Laboratory, Shanghai Second People's Hospital, Shanghai,China.(2)Madonna University, Livonia, Michigan, USA.Kaempferol is a flavonoid that has been extensively investigated owing to itsantitumor effects. Nevertheless, little is known about its underlying mechanisms of action. We aimed to explore the role of kaempferol in breast cancer (BC), and thus, we investigated how kaempferol suppresses the growth of BC cells. The cellswere treated with kaempferol and the effects on multiple cancer-associatedpathways were evaluated. The MTS assay was used to study the cell growthinhibition induced by kaempferol. The cell cycle (CC) was analyzed by flowcytometry. Western blotting was used to analyze cellular apoptosis and DNAdamage. We found that the proliferation of the triple-negative BC (TNBC) cellMDA-MB-231 was suppressed effectively by kaempferol. Interestingly, thesuppressive effect of kaempferol on cell proliferation was stronger in MDA-MB-231cells than in the estrogen receptor-positive BT474 cell line. Furthermore, after the treatment with kaempferol for 48 h, the population of cells in the G1 phasewas significantly reduced, from 85.48% to 51.35%, and population of cells in the G2 phase increased markedly from 9.27% to 37.5%, which indicated that kaempferol contributed to the induction of G2/M arrest. Kaempferol also induced apoptosisand DNA damage in MDA-MB-231 cells. Kaempferol increased the expression levels ofÎ³H2AX, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, and p-ATM compared to those of thecontrol group. Collectively, these results showed that kaempferol may be apotential drug for the effective treatment of TNBC.DOI: 10.3727/096504018X15228018559434 PMID: 29739490
