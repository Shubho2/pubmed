Malaysia.Despite advances in the treatment regimen, the high incidence rate of breastcancer (BC) deaths is mostly caused by metastasis. Recently, the aberrantepigenetic modifications, which involve DNA methylation, histone modificationsand microRNA (miRNA) regulations become attractive targets to treat metastaticbreast cancer (MBC). In this review, the epigenetic alterations of DNAmethylation, histone modifications and miRNA regulations in regulating MBC isdiscussed. The preclinical and clinical trials of epigenetic drugs such as theinhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (DNMTi) and the inhibitor of histonedeacetylase (HDACi), as a single or combined regimen with other epigenetic drugor standard chemotherapy drug to treat MBCs are discussed. The combined regimenof epigenetic drugs or with standard chemotherapy drugs enhance the therapeuticeffect against MBC. Evidences that epigenetic changes could have implications in diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutics for MBC are also presented. Several geneshave been identified as potential epigenetic biomarkers for diagnosis andprognosis, as well as therapeutic targets for MBC. Endeavors in clinical trialsof epigenetic drugs against MBC should be continued although limited success has been achieved. Future discovery of epigenetic drugs from natural resources would be an attractive natural treatment regimen for MBC. Further research is warrantedin translating research into clinical practice with the ultimate goal of treatingMBC by epigenetic therapy in the near future.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1568009618666180430130248 PMID: 29714144
