We assessed each aspect above by comparing iliac crest reconstruction with bone cement and screws following harvest with no reconstruction.METHODS: We evaluated patients who underwent large iliac crest harvesting,including ten patients who underwent iliac crest defect reconstruction with bone cement and cancellous screws (R group) and ten randomly matched patients without reconstruction (NR group) were evaluated prospectively in the same period. Local pain, cosmesis and other complications were assessed postoperatively at 1 week,6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months.RESULTS: Pain, cosmesis and satisfaction of patients significantly differedbetween the two groups. The R group exhibited less complications and lower painvisual analogue scores at postoperative 1 week (p < 0.001), 6 weeks (p < 0.001)and 3 months (p < 0.01) but not at 6 months, at which time patients reportedalmost no pain. One patient reported pain for more than 1 year in the NR group.The R group exhibited better cosmesis, morphology and satisfaction than the NRgroup. In the NR group, one patient suffered pain when sitting up and anotherwhen wearing a belt.CONCLUSION: Postoperative pain can be reduced and cosmesis can be improvedthrough reconstructing the iliac crest defects after autogenous harvesting withbone cement and cancellous screws. The technique is simple, safe and easy toimplement.DOI: 10.1186/s12891-018-2167-7 PMCID: PMC6053794PMID: 30025526
