In this work, we conduct an integrativeanalysis on five re-annotated lncRNA expression datasets from the Gene ExpressionOmnibus (GEO) which included a total of 891 BC samples. We identified afive-lncRNA signature that was significantly associated with DFS in the training cohort of 327 patients. We found the five-lncRNA signature could effectivelystratify patients in the training dataset into high- and low-risk groups withsignificantly different DFS (p = 3.29 × 10-5 , log-rank test). The five-lncRNAsignature was effectively validated in four independent cohorts, and prognosticanalysis results showed that the five-lncRNA signature was independent ofclinical prognostic factors, such as BC subtypes and adjuvant treatments.Furthermore, GSEA suggested that the five-lncRNA signature was involved in BCmetastasis-related pathways. Our findings indicate that these five lncRNAs may beimplicated in BC pathogenesis, and further, these lncRNAs may potentially serveas novel candidate biomarkers for the identification of BC patients at high risk for tumor recurrence.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31573 PMID: 29707762
