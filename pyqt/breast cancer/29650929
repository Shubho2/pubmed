A 68-year-old female patientparticularly complained of the presence of a right axillary mass. The mass in theright axilla was palpable, but no tumor was found in both the breasts onpalpation, ultrasound examination, or MRI. Partial breast resection and axillary lymph node dissection were performed following a diagnosis of invasive ductalcarcinoma by core needle biopsy. There was no mammary gland tissue present aroundthe tumor due to the pathology of the disease, and the tumor was diagnosed asoccult breast cancer. As the cancer was ER negative and HER2 positive, treatment with a combination of FEC, docetaxel, and trastuzumab was initiated.Radiotherapy, which irradiated the right supraclavicular fossa and the rightmammary gland, was administered. No disease recurrence and mammary tumor has beenreported in the patient till date. Treatment of occult breast cancer generallyincludes local therapy such as radiation and surgery. However, in the presentcase, we did not operate upon the breast; instead we treated the right breast andthe right supraclavicular fossa with radiation therapy. As the tumor was HER2positive, we reasoned that local control of disease would be likely if treatment with chemotherapy and trastuzumab was performed effectively.PMID: 29650929  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
