Trastuzumabemtansine (Kadcyla, T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate that is comprised oftrastuzumab covalently linked to the antimitotic agent DM1 through a stablelinker, was designed to selectively deliver DM1 to HER2-overexpressing tumorcells. T-DM1 is approved for the treatment of patients with HER2-positivemetastatic breast cancer following progression on trastuzumab and a taxane.Despite the improvement in clinical outcome, many patients who initially respond to T-DM1 treatment eventually develop progressive disease. The mechanisms thatcontribute to T-DM1 resistance are not fully understood. To this end, wedeveloped T-DM1-resistant in vitro models to examine the mechanisms of acquiredT-DM1 resistance. We demonstrate that decreased HER2 and upregulation of MDR1contribute to T-DM1 resistance in KPL-4 T-DM1-resistant cells. In contrast, both loss of SLC46A3 and PTEN deficiency play a role in conferring resistance inBT-474M1 T-DM1-resistant cells. Our data suggest that these two cell linesacquire resistance through distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, we show that theKPL-4 T-DM1 resistance can be overcome by treatment with an inhibitor of MDR1,whereas a PI3K inhibitor can rescue PTEN loss-induced resistance inT-DM1-resistant BT-474M1 cells. Our results provide a rationale for developingtherapeutic strategies to enhance T-DM1 clinical efficacy by combining T-DM1 and other inhibitors that target signaling transduction or resistance pathways.
