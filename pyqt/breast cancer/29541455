China.Kinesin Family Member 3A (KIF3A) was recognized as a key factor of ciliogenesisand transport system of primary cilia in normal cells. However, its possiblefunction on cancer cells has yet to be identified. In the present study,microarray tissue chips, including 230 breast cancer samples, were applied todetermine the KIF3A expression pattern by immunological histological chemistry.Statistical analysis on the KIF3A expression level and the currently usedclinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer patients was carried out.Follow-up data of these patients over 10 years were also used to evaluate therelationship between KIF3A and the survival rate. The expression levels of KIF3A were significantly higher in 140 breast cancer tissues than those of 90para-carcinoma samples, which served as controls (P<0.001). In addition, in afurther 70 paired samples, the same higher expression level was observed incancer tissues compared with their self-paired controls (P<0.001). Furthermore,the high expression of KIF3A in breast cancer tissue correlated with the statusof estrogen receptor, androgen receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor andKi-67 of breast cancer patients, and were also related to their pathology gradeand lymph node metastasis. The survival analysis showed a better survival rate inthe patients with a higher expression level of KIF3A. Collectively, the triadicassociations of KIF3A, the currently used clinicopathological parameters andsurvival rate suggest that KIF3A is involved in the tumorigenesis and progressionof breast cancer. Thus, KIF3A could be considered a promising novel prognosticindex in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/br.2018.1061 PMCID: PMC5838305PMID: 29541455
