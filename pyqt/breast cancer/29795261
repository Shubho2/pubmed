To characterizepotential regulators of AnAc action, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 6 h with purified AnAc 24:1n5 congener followed by next generation transcriptomicsequencing (RNA-seq) and network analysis. We reported that AnAc-differentiallyregulated miRNA transcriptomes in each cell line and now identify AnAc-regulated changes in mRNA and lncRNA transcript expression. In MCF-7 cells, 80AnAc-responsive genes were identified, including lncRNA MIR22HG. MoreAnAc-responsive genes (886) were identified in MDA-MB-231 cells. Only six geneswere commonly altered by AnAc in both cell lines: SCD, INSIG1, and TGM2 weredecreased and PDK4, GPR176, and ZBT20 were increased. Modeling of AnAc-inducedgene changes suggests that AnAc inhibits monounsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in both cell lines and increases endoplasmic reticulum stress in MDA-MB-231cells. Since modeling of downregulated genes implicated NFκB in MCF-7, weconfirmed that AnAc inhibited TNFα-induced NFκB reporter activity in MCF-7 cells.These data identify new targets and pathways that may account for AnAc'santi-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-26429-x PMCID: PMC5966448PMID: 29795261
