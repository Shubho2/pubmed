Electronicaddress: arun.iyer@wayne.edu.Paclitaxel (PTX) encapsulated in albumin (Abraxane®) is an FDA approved frontlinenano-formulation for treating advance metastatic pancreatic, lung and breastcancers. Currently in clinic, Abraxane® is being used as a one of the components of combination therapy regimens. On the other hand, difluorinated curcumin (CDF) is a novel and potent synthetic curcumin analogue that is being evaluated forseveral malignancies including pancreatic, liver, ovarian and breast cancers. To improve the bioavailability and targeting ability of hydrophobic PTX and CDF, we have encapsulated them in folic acid decorated bovine serum albuminnanoparticles, namely FA-BSA-PTX and FA-BSA-CDF, respectively. Both theformulations yielded uniform nano-sized particles with smooth surface morphology,negative surface potential and high drug loading efficiency. Due to heterogeneityand complexity of several cancers, combination regimens are becoming standardarsenals against several deadly cancers. To evaluate the synergistic anti-cancer effect of PTX and CDF, we assessed the combination therapy using intravenouslyadministrable folate decorated albumin bio-conjugate nanoparticles against folateoverexpressing ovarian and cervical cancers. Our results demonstrate thatcombination of FA-BSA-CDF with FA-BSA-PTX produced synergistic anticancer effect,augmented due to folate receptor mediated targeted uptake as well as induction ofapoptosis. In conclusion, our preliminary studies show a promising nanomedicineplatform for combination therapy for leading gynecological tumor, such as ovarianand cervical cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
