The cell lines with the highest expression of YAP1 were selected as theexperimental materials. qRT-PCR and Western blot assay were used to detect theinterference effect of si-YAP1. The cell proliferation and the effect on thePI3K-Akt signal pathway were examined by MTT and Western blot.RESULTS: The expression of YAP1 significantly increased in the thyroid carcinoma cell line compared with normal thyroid cells, among which the expression of YAP1 in TPC-1 was the highest. Quantitative PCR and Western blot results showedsignificant interference effects. The MTT assay indicated that YAP1 interference suppressed the proliferation of cells and the expression of p-Akt.CONCLUSIONS: The interference of YAP1 can inhibit the growth of thyroid cancercells, and its mechanism may be associated with the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.PMID: 29762852
