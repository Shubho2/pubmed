We identified a novel mechanism by which thepentose phosphate pathway and the endoplasmic reticulum protein processingpathway might be regulated via lysine succinylation in their core enzymes.CONCLUSIONS: These results expand our understanding of tumorigenesis mechanismsand provide a basis for further characterization of the pathophysiological roles in breast cancer progression, laying a foundation for innovative and novel breastcancer drugs and therapies.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0893-1 PMID: 30022435
