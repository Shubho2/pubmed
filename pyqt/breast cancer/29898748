"Intervention" patient was additionally provided with onethree-hour course on psychological stresses and management skills. Changes ofanxiety and depression score and their 3-level severity category ('normal','borderline' and 'abnormal' scored 0-7, 8-10 and 11-21, respectively) from HADSquestionnaire over RT were evaluated by multivariable linear and ordinal logisticregressions.RESULTS: Response rates were 94 and 100% by "intervention" and "control" arm,respectively. Means of score changes by "intervention" and "control" (n = 145)were + 0.59 (SD = 2.47) and + 0.11 (SD = 2.55) for anxiety and + 0.81 (SD = 2.81)and + 0.45 (SD = 2.77) for depression scores, respectively. 'Abnormal' anxietyand depression patients were 4.1 and 6.9% at baseline and 4.8 and 6.9% at end of RT at 'control' arm; those rates were 6.6 and 7.4%, and 8.8 and 10.3% at'intervention' arm, respectively. Both changes on anxiety and depressionmeasurements between two arms were all insignificant (p > 0.20).CONCLUSIONS: One education course did not reduce the score and severity ofanxiety and depression symptoms over RT period.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry #: ChiCTR-IIR-16008818 atwww.chictr.org.cn .DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-1054-6 PMCID: PMC6000931PMID: 29898748
