China.Dysregulation of microRNAs has been confirmed to serve an important role incancer development and progression. However, the role of microRNA (miR)-544 incolorectal cancer progression remains unknown. In the present study, it wasobserved that the expression level of miR-544 was increased in breast cancer celllines and tissues using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Overexpression of miR-544 promoted cell proliferation and invasion in colorectal cancer, whereas inhibition of miR-544 suppressed colorectal cancer progression asdetermined using MTT, colony formation and Transwell assays. Furthermore,forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) was a direct target of miR-544. FOXO1 mediatedmiR-544-regulated colorectal cancer progression and cell cycle distribution. Inconclusion, the results of the present study revealed that miR-544 serves animportant role in promoting human colorectal cancer cell progression.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7381 PMCID: PMC5772941PMID: 29422969
