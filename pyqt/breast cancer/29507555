The EGFR inhibitors are used at present in the treatment of such cancers.Skin lesions that develop during and after cancer treatment may be due tospecific cytostatics, molecular-targeted drugs, radiation therapy, complementary therapy, or the cancer itself, and hence knowledge is essential to distinguishbetween them. The mechanism through which skin toxicity arises during treatmentwith EGFR inhibitors is not well known, but seems to be due to the modificationof the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signal path associated with its activation, which results in the similarity between the adverse effects of EGFR inhibitors and thetreatment of melanoma with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. The most common side effects are pruritus, xerosis, papulopustular rash, hand-foot skin reaction, alopecia anddystrophy of the hair, and paronychia. This work presents options for prevention and suggestions for managing these adverse events, which are of importance in thecare of patients undergoing oncological treatment.DOI: 10.5114/ada.2017.71106 PMCID: PMC5831275PMID: 29507555
