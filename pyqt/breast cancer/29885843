Electronic address:oncology_zhang@outlook.com.Dysregulation of cell proliferation and death is considered the foundation of themalignant biological characteristics of cancer. In this study, we conducted acomprehensive analysis of a massively parallel whole transcriptome resequencingof paired papillary thyroid cancer and normal thyroid tissues from 19 patients.In addition, we found that LRP4, a member of the low-density lipoproteinreceptor-related protein family, is significantly overexpressed in thyroidcarcinoma. We demonstrated through quantitative real-time polymerase chainreaction (qRT-PCR) that LRP4 is upregulated in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC)tissues. This observation was also consistent with data analyzed from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. Thus, the biological role of LRP4 in the thyroidcancer in the present study was investigated using the PTC cell lines TPC1, BCPAPand KTC-1. In these cell lines, the mRNA level of LRP4 was higher than normalthyroid cancer cell named HTORI3. In vitro experiments demonstrated that LRP4downregulation significantly inhibited the colony formation, proliferation,migration, and invasion of the three PTC cell lines. Knockdown of LRP4 by smallinterfering RNA (siRNA) in those cell lines decreased the protein expression ofN-cadherin, Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and Zinc finger E-box-bindinghome-box 1 (ZEB1). Furthermore, LRP4 knockdown significantly reduced the levelsof phosphorylated PI3K in the PTC cell lines. In conclusion, the present studyindicated that LRP4 is a gene associated with PTC and might become a potentialtherapeutic target.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
