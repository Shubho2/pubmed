The aminefunctionalized SLNs was employed tosimultaneously deliver angiostatin (ANG) plasmid and candesartan (CD) to the samecancer cell. The well-formed ANG/CD/SLNs exhibited small particle size,reasonable positive charges, excellent loading of drug and gene in vitro.Moreover, aminefunctionalized SLNs were almost no cytotoxicity. ANG/CD/SLNsresulted in enhanced gene transfection compared to naked plasmid. Moreimportantly, ANG/CD/SLNs as a co-delivery system achieved a stronger inhibitoryeffect on angiogenesis in vitro, possibly resulting from significantdownregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression viadifferent pathways. In particular, in vivo investigation on nude mice bearingMCF-7 xenografts confirmed that ANG/CD/SLNs codelivery system exerted stronganti-tumor efficacy by synergistic antiangiogenic mechanism.DOI: 10.1166/jnn.2018.14541 PMID: 29442906  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
