Bcl-extra large(xL)/myeloid cell leukemia sequence (Mcl)-1 was demonstrated to be expressed atrelatively high levels in clinically aggressive basal-like cancers and inhibitingBcl-xL overexpression could potentially provoke cell death. A molecule able totarget Bcl-xL/Mcl-1, JY-1-106, is herein under investigation. It is also knownthat vitamin A-derived compounds exhibit antitumor activity in a variety of invitro experimental models, promoting their effects via nuclear receptor isoforms including retinoic acid receptors (RARs). Pre-clinical observation highlightedthat triple negative (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor/human epidermalgrowth factor receptor)-breast cancer cells displayed resistance to retinoids dueto the RARγ high expression profile. The present study used the triple-negativehuman breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, to analyze the effects of theBcl-xL/Mcl-1 synthetic inhibitor, JY-1-106, alone or in combination withretinoids on cell viability. The results revealed a synergistic effect inreducing cell viability primarily by using JY-1-106 with the selective RARγantagonist SR11253, which induces massive autophagy and necrosis. Furthermore,the results highlighted that JY-1-106 alone is able to positively influence thegene expression profile of p53 and RARα, providing a therapeutic advantage inhuman triple-negative breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8258 PMCID: PMC5962833PMID: 29849791
