In the present study, we aimed tocompare the in vitro and in vivo effects of SeNPs and folic acid surface-coatedselenium nanoparticles (FA@SeNPs) on breast cancer.METHODS: FA@SeNPs and SeNPs were chemically synthesized and characterized withdifferent instrumental techniques. The cytotoxicity of both nanomaterials wasevaluated against 4T1 cells. In addition, the intravenous administration effectof these nanomaterials (300 μg/week) on the lifespan and tumor size ofcancer-bearing mice was investigated.RESULTS: Although the SeNPs showed an antiproliferative effect against the cellline, the cytotoxicity of the FA@SeNPs was higher than that of the SeNPs. A lowconcentration of FA@SeNPs (25 μg/mL corresponding to 8.75 μg/mL of elementalSeNPs) caused approximately 68% cell mortality. In the in vivo study, thenanomaterials decreased the tumor growth rate in cancerous mice in relation tothe control group. FA@SeNPs were more effective than SeNPs.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of SeNPs and FA has a potent antiproliferativeeffect against 4T1 cells, significantly increases the lifespan, and preventstumor growth.Copyright © 2018.
