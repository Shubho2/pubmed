Here, we studied the interdependence of transcription initiation, splicingand polyadenylation events on single mRNA molecules by full-length mRNAsequencing.RESULTS: In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we find 2700 genes with interdependentalternative transcription initiation, splicing and polyadenylation events, bothin proximal and distant parts of mRNA molecules, including examples of couplingbetween transcription start sites and polyadenylation sites. The analysis ofthree human primary tissues (brain, heart and liver) reveals similar patterns of interdependency between transcription initiation and mRNA processing events. Wepredict thousands of novel open reading frames from full-length mRNA sequencesand obtained evidence for their translation by shotgun proteomics. The mappingdatabase rescues 358 previously unassigned peptides and improves the assignmentof others. By recognizing sample-specific amino-acid changes and novel splicingpatterns, full-length mRNA sequencing improves proteogenomics analysis of MCF-7cells.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that our understanding of transcriptomecomplexity is far from complete and provides a basis to reveal largely unresolvedmechanisms that coordinate transcription initiation and mRNA processing.DOI: 10.1186/s13059-018-1418-0 PMCID: PMC5877393PMID: 29598823
