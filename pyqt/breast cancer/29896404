We herein report the case of an86-year-old female patient who had undergone mastectomy and axillarylymphadenectomy for invasive ductal cell breast carcinoma 2 years prior, followedby adjuvant hormonal therapy with letrozole. During hospitalization for anemiaassociated with an inflammatory syndrome and abdominal pain with menorrhagia, an abdominal ultrasound examination revealed a suspicious uterine mass withirregular contours and abnormal vascularization with associated increase of theblood level of cancer antigen 15-3 to 34 kU/l. The histological andimmunohistochemical analysis of a cervical biopsy sample discover a secondarylesion metastatic from the primary ductal cell breast carcinoma. The metastatictissue was hormone-negative, which was compatible with disease progression duringhormonal therapy. Considering the multiple metastasis, comorbidities,unfavourable performance status and the quick deterioration of the patient'sclinical condition, only best supportive care was administered.DOI: 10.3892/mco.2018.1627 PMCID: PMC5995064PMID: 29896404
