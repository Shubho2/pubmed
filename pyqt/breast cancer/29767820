Under these premises the resection of livermetastases and visceral metastases of non-gastrointestinal tumors is performedincreasingly more frequently in selected patients. The aim of this study was toevaluate the role of visceral oncological surgery in hepatic oligometastaticdisease of non-gastrointestinal tumors according to the currently availableliterature.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE and PubMed was carried outfocusing on the topics of oligometastases, liver resection and metastectomy forbreast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, ovarian cancer andnon-small cell lung cancer.RESULTS: The evidence is limited to retrospective studies and case series. Inselected patients after liver resection and multimodal therapy 5‑year survivalrates of 53% (breast cancer), 62% (renal cell carcinoma), 22% (malignantmelanoma) and 50% (ovarian cancer) are described. For lung cancer (NSCLC) median survival was 12 month. Prognostic factors n were a disease free survival of>12 months, R0-resection, response to systemic therapy and extra hepatic/extraabdominal metastases. These could be selection criteria for liver resection.Recurrence liver resection, resection of the pancreas and cytoreductive surgeryincluding multivisceral resection (ovarian cancer) could also improve survival.CONCLUSION: Regarding limited evidence patients with oligometastatic diseaseorigin from non-gastrointestinal tumors could benefit from liver resection. Tumorbiology and response to targeted individualized systemic therapy become moreimportant in this scenario.DOI: 10.1007/s00104-018-0647-9 PMID: 29767820
