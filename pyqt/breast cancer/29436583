The present study investigated the antiproliferativeeffects of PD0332991 on gastric cancer (GC) cells and the underlying molecularmechanisms. The activity of PD0332991 was tested in several GC cell lines,including AGS, KATO‑Ⅲ, NCI‑N87 and HS746T. Growth inhibitory activity ofPD0332991, alone or in combination with fluorouracil (5‑FU), was measured by MTT assay. The effects of PD0332991 on cell cycle progression were analyzed by flowcytometry and western blotting. Protein pathway array and Ingenuity PathwayAnalysis were used to identify signaling pathways that may mediate theantiproliferative effects of PD0332991. PD0332991 inhibited proliferation in adose‑dependent manner and enhanced the activity of 5‑FU in all GC cell linestested. Cells treated with PD0332991 exhibited cell cycle arrest in G1 phase ofthe cell cycle, whereas the number of cells in G2/M phase was decreased.PD0332991 also inhibited CDK6‑specific phosphorylation of retinoblastoma onSer780, reduced the expression of cyclin D1, and induced expression of p53 andp27. Furthermore, 31 proteins were identified, the expression of which wassignificantly altered following treatment with PD0332991 in at least three celllines. Pathway analysis indicated that the altered proteins were frequentlyassociated with cell death, cell cycle and the molecular mechanism of cancer. Theresults of the present study indicated that PD0332991 may inhibit cellproliferation via modulation of the cell cycle, and may affect numerous oncogenicsignaling pathways. Therefore, PD0332991 may be considered effective for thetreatment of GC.DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.2018.3460 PMCID: PMC5846637PMID: 29436583
