This drug hasimmunosuppressive and anticancer activities and the present in vitro study wasaimed at identifying the cellular and molecular profiles of breast cancer cellspredictive of sensitivity to everolimus.MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCF-7, T-47D, ZR-75-1, CAMA-1, HCC-1500 and MCF-10A cells were used and viability was assessed using WST-1 dye. Sensitivity to everolimuswas correlated with phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473/Thr308), mTOR (Ser2448), andERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and mutational profile of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, TSC1, TSC2 and FRAP genes. Protein phosphorylation was evaluated by AlphaScreenSureFire, while the mutational status was examined by digital droplet PCR andSanger sequencing.RESULTS: Everolimus showed a transient growth inhibition in non-tumorigeniccells, while in tumorigenic lines the drug suppressed the proliferation in aconcentration-dependent manner but with different potency (IC50) and efficacy(Emax), being ZR-75-1 the most sensitive and T47D the least sensitive. MCF-7,T47D and HCC1500 had activating mutations in PIK3CA gene, while loss-of-activity PTEN mutations were detected in sensitive cell lines, including ZR-75-1, whichshowed no changes or minimal increase in the amount of p-AKT(Ser473/Thr308) andp-ERK1/2(Thr202/Tyr204) induced by everolimus compared to the resistant cell lineT47D in which phosphorylation of AKT and ERK was increased.CONCLUSIONS: Cellular levels of p-AKT(Ser473/Thr308) and p-ERK1/2(Thr202/Tyr204),activating mutations of PIK3CA and inactivating mutations of PTEN may predictresponse to everolimus in breast cancer cells; these findings have potentialapplications for treatment personalization of everolimus in breast cancerpatients.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3543-6 PMID: 29476223
