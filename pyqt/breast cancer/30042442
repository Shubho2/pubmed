However, recent clinical trial studies revealed thatblockade of PI3K activity in advanced cancer often leads to the development ofresistance and relapse of the diseases. Intense efforts have been made toelucidate resistance mechanisms and identify rational drug combinations with PI3Kinhibitors in solid tumors. In the current study, we found that PI3K inhibitionby GDC-0941 increased macrophage infiltration and induced the expression ofmacrophage-associated cytokines and chemokines in the mouse 4T1 breast tumormodel. Using the in vitro co-culture system, we showed that the presence ofmacrophages led to the activation of NF-κB signaling in 4T1 tumor cells,rendering tumor cells resistant to PI3K inhibition by GDC-0941. Furthermore, wefound that Aspirin could block the activation of NF-κB signaling induced by PI3K inhibition, and combined use of GDC-0941 and Aspirin resulted in attenuated cell growth and enhanced apoptosis of 4T1 cells in the in vitro co-culture system withthe presence of macrophages. Consistently, the combination treatment alsoeffectively reduced tumor burden, macrophage infiltration and pulmonarymetastasis in in vivo 4T1 breast tumor model. Together, our results suggestedmacrophages in microenvironment may contribute to the resistance of breast cancercells to PI3K inhibition and reveal a new combination paradigm to improve theefficacy of PI3K-targeted therapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0849-6 PMCID: PMC6057974PMID: 30042442
