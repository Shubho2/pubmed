Analyses included proportionalhazards models and general population comparisons.RESULTS: CVD rate-ratio for left-versus-right breast irradiation without IMC was 1.11 (95% CI 0.93-1.32). Compared to right-sided breast irradiation only, IMCirradiation (interquartile range mean heart doses 9-17 Gy) was associated withincreases in CVD rate overall, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure (HF) and valvular heart disease (hazard ratios (HRs): 1.6-2.4). IHD risk remainedincreased until at least 20 years after treatment. Anthracycline-basedchemotherapy was associated with an increased HF rate (HR = 4.18, 95% CI3.07-5.69), emerging <5 years and remaining increased at least 10-15 years after treatment. IMC irradiation combined with anthracycline-based chemotherapy wasassociated with substantially increased HF rate (HR = 9.23 95% CI 6.01-14.18),compared to neither IMC irradiation nor anthracycline-based chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: Women treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy and IMCirradiation (in an older era) with considerable mean heart dose exposure havesubstantially increased incidence of several CVDs. Screening may be appropriatefor some BC patient groups.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0159-x PMID: 30065254
