However, no previous analyses targetedlength of stay (LOS) changes over time after major surgical oncologicalprocedures (MSOPs).METHODS: Between 2003 and 2013, we retrospectively identified patients, whounderwent prostatectomy, colectomy, cystectomy, mastectomy, gastrectomy,hysterectomy, nephrectomy, oophorectomy, lung resection or pancreatectomy within the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. A total of 3 431 602 assessable patients wereidentified. We examined temporal trends of LOS after ten MSOPs, as well as LOSdeterminants and the impact of LOS on total hospital charges (THCGs). Univariableand multivariable linear, log-linear, logistic (MLR) and Poisson regression (MPR)analyses were used.RESULTS: Mean and median LOS were respectively 6 and 4 days (IQR 2-7). During thestudy span, LOS decreased [Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC): -1.89%,p = 0.0002]. Of the ten examined MSOPs, nine showed a decrease that rangedfrom -4.47% in prostatectomy to -0.7% in mastectomy. Conversely, no decrease inLOS was recorded for colectomy (EAPC:+0.37, p = 0.015). In MPR analyses, robotic [Relative risk (RR):0.68, p = 0.0003] and laparoscopic (RR: 0.90, p < 0.0001)surgical approaches were associated with shorter LOS. LOS was directly related toTHCGs.CONCLUSIONS: Since the implementation of ERAS protocols, LOS has decreased fornine out of ten MSOPs in a significant fashion. Although these gains may appearmarginal on an annual basis, their cumulative effect, over the study span, rangesfor 7.7%-49.2%, which can hardly be interpreted as marginal. LOS decreasedirectly translates in THCGs savings.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
