In vitro assay result encouraged to further movetowards in ovo anticancer evaluation using chick embryo. The series of QCTderivatives showed higher anticancer and antiangiogenic activity against HeLa andMCF-7 cell lines. In the series, synthetic molecule 8d, 8l, and 8m displayedsignificant activity. Further, these results substantiated by docking study onVGFR2. SAR study concluded that the potency of drugs depends on the nature ofaliphatic substitution and the heterocyclic ring system.DOI: 10.1007/s10787-018-0471-3 PMID: 29663100
