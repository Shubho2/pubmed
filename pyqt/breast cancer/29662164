Using newcomputational methods, we show that transcription factors (TFs) occupy multipleloci associated with individual complex genetic disorders. Application to 213phenotypes and 1,544 TF binding datasets identified 2,264 relationships betweenhundreds of TFs and 94 phenotypes, including androgen receptor in prostate cancerand GATA3 in breast cancer. Strikingly, nearly half of systemic lupuserythematosus risk loci are occupied by the Epstein-Barr virus EBNA2 protein and many coclustering human TFs, showing gene-environment interaction. SimilarEBNA2-anchored associations exist in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis,inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis andceliac disease. Instances of allele-dependent DNA binding and downstream effects on gene expression at plausibly causal variants support genetic mechanismsdependent on EBNA2. Our results nominate mechanisms that operate across risk lociwithin disease phenotypes, suggesting new models for disease origins.DOI: 10.1038/s41588-018-0102-3 PMCID: PMC6022759 [Available on 2018-10-16]PMID: 29662164
