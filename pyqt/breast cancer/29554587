Electronic address: vinod.kumar@cup.edu.in.A number of pyrimidine bridged combretastatin derivatives were designed,synthesized and evaluated for anticancer activities against breast cancer (MCF-7)and lung cancer (A549) cell lines using MTT assays. Most of the synthesizedcompounds displayed good anticancer activity with IC50 values in low micro-molar range. Compounds 4a and 4p were found most potent in the series with IC50 values of 4.67 µM & 3.38 µM and 4.63 µM & 3.71 µM against MCF7 and A549 cancer celllines, respectively. Biological evaluation of these compounds showed thatselective cancer cell toxicity (in vitro using human lung and breast cancer cell lines) might be due to the inhibition of antioxidant enzymes instigating elevatedROS levels which triggers intrinsic apoptotic pathways. These compounds werefound nontoxic to the normal human primary cells. Compound 4a, was found to becompetitive inhibitor of colchicine and in the tubulin binding assay it showedtubulin polymerization inhibition potential comparable to colchicine. Themolecular modeling studies also showed that the synthesized compounds fit well inthe colchicine-binding pocket.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
