MONALEESA-7 aimed to assess the efficacy and safety ofribociclib plus endocrine therapy in premenopausal women with advanced,HR-positive breast cancer.METHODS: This phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial wasdone at 188 centres in 30 countries. Eligible patients were premenopausal womenaged 18-59 years who had histologically or cytologically confirmed HR-positive,HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Groupperformance status of 0 or 1; measurable disease as per Response EvaluationCriteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 criteria, or at least one predominantlylytic bone lesion; and had not received previous treatment with cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibitors. Endocrine therapy and chemotherapy in the adjuvant orneoadjuvant setting was permitted, as was up to one line of chemotherapy foradvanced disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via interactive response technology to receive oral ribociclib (600 mg/day on a 3-weeks-on, 1-week-offschedule) or matching placebo with either oral tamoxifen (20 mg daily) or anon-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (letrozole 2·5 mg or anastrozole 1 mg, bothoral, daily), all with goserelin (3·6 mg administered subcutaneously on day 1 of every 28-day cycle). Patients and investigators were masked to treatmentassignment. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat, and safety was assessedin all patients who received at least one dose of any study treatment. Theprimary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. MONALEESA-7is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02278120 and is ongoing, but no longer enrolling patients.FINDINGS: Between Dec 17, 2014, and Aug 1, 2016, 672 patients were randomlyassigned: 335 to the ribociclib group and 337 to the placebo group. Perinvestigator's assessment, median progression-free survival was 23·8 months (95% CI 19·2-not reached) in the ribociclib group compared with 13·0 months(11·0-16·4) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·55, 95% CI 0·44-0·69; p<0·0001).Grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in more than 10% of patients in either groupwere neutropenia (203 [61%] of 335 patients in the ribociclib group and 12 [4%]of 337 in the placebo group) and leucopenia (48 [14%] and four [1%]). Seriousadverse events occurred in 60 (18%) of 335 patients in the ribociclib group and39 (12%) of 337 in the placebo group, of which 15 (4%) and six (2%),respectively, were attributed to the study regimen. 12 (4%) of 335 patients inthe ribociclib group and ten (3%) of 337 in the placebo group discontinuedtreatment because of adverse events. No treatment-related deaths occurred. 11deaths occurred (five [1%] in the ribociclib group and six [2%] in the placebogroup) during or within 30 days after treatment, most of which were due toprogression of the underlying breast cancer (three [1%] and six [2%]). Theremaining two deaths in the ribociclib group were due to an intracranialhaemorrhage in an anticoagulated patient, and a pre-existing wound haemorrhage inanother patient.INTERPRETATION: Ribociclib plus endocrine therapy improved progression-freesurvival compared with placebo plus endocrine therapy, and had a manageablesafety profile in patients with premenopausal, HR-positive, HER2-negative,advanced breast cancer. The combination could represent a new first-linetreatment option for these patients.FUNDING: Novartis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
