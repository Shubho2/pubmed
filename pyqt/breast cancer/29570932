The mechanisms by which TTP isregulated in breast cancer are poorly understood. Using multiple biochemicalapproaches, we found that proviral insertion in murine lymphomas 2 (PIM2) is anovel binding partner of TTP. Interestingly, PIM2 decreased TTP protein levelsindependent of its kinase activity. PIM2 instead targeted TTP protein fordegradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Furthermore,immunohistochemical staining showed that PIM2 and TTP protein levels werenegatively correlated in human breast cancer samples. Indeed, PIM2 overexpressionde-repressed TTP-mediated inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation andmigration in vitro and promoted breast tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Thesefindings demonstrate an important role for the PIM2-TTP complex in breast cancer tumorigenesis, suggesting that PIM2 may represent a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.© 2018 The Authors.
