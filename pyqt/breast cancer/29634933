Here, we show that while focaladhesion complexes are disassembled during mitotic rounding, integrins remain in place. These integrin-rich contacts connect mitotic cells to the underlyingsubstrate throughout mitosis, guide polarized cell migration following mitoticexit, and are functionally important, since adherent cells undergo divisionfailure when removed from the substrate. Further, the ability of cells tore-spread along pre-existing adhesive contacts is essential for division in cellscompromised in their ability to construct a RhoGEF-dependent (Ect2) actomyosinring. As a result, following Ect2 depletion, cells fail to divide on smalladhesive islands but successfully divide on larger patterns, as the connectionbetween daughter cells narrows and severs as they migrate away from one another. In this way, regulated re-modeling of cell-substrate adhesions during mitoticrounding aids division in animal cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
