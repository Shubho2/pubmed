Turkey.BACKGROUND: Although conventional chemotherapy is the most common method forcancer treatment, it has several side effects such as neuropathy, alopecia andcardiotoxicity. Since the drugs are given to body systemically, normal cells are also affected, just like cancer cells. However, in recent years, targeted drugdelivery has been developed to overcome these drawbacks.OBJECTIVE: The aim in this study was targeted co-delivery of doxorubicin (Dox)which is an anticancer agent and D-α-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000succinate (vitamin E TPGS or simply TPGS) to breast cancer cells. For thispurpose, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesized and coated with oleicacid (OA). Coated nanoparticles were encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid(PLGA) and TPGS polymers and loaded with Dox. The nanoparticles (NPs) werecharacterized by fouirer transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, zeta-potentialanalysis, dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis, thermal gravimetric analysis(TGA) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis.RESULTS: The results showed that NPs were spherical, superparamagnetic and in thedesired range for use in drug targeting. The targetability of NPs was confirmed. Moreover, TPGS and Dox loading was shown by TGA and FTIR analyses. NPs wereinternalized by cells and the cytotoxic effect of drug loaded NPs on sensitive(MCF-7) and drug-resistant (MCF-7/Dox) cells were examined. It was seen that the presence of TPGS increased cytotoxicity significantly. TPGS also enhanced drugloading efficiency, release rate, cellular internalization. In MCF-7/Dox cells,the drug resistance seems to be decreased when Dox is loaded onto TPGS containingNPs.CONCLUSION: This magnetic PLGA nanoparticle system is important for newgeneration targeted chemotherapy and could be used for breast cancer treatmentafter in vivo tests.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1871520618666180313154724 PMID: 29532763
