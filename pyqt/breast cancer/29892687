NF1 patients have anincreased risk of developing early onset breast cancer, however, the association between NF1 and high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is unclear. Since mostNF1-related tumors exhibit early biallelic inactivation of NF1, we evaluated the evolution of genetic alterations in HGSOC in an NF1 patient. Somatic variationanalysis of whole exome sequencing of tumor samples from both ovaries and aperitoneal metastasis showed a clonal lineage originating from an ancestral clonewithin the left adnexa, which exhibited copy number (CN) loss of heterozygosity(LOH) in the region of chromosome 17 containing TP53, NF1, and BRCA1 and mutationof the other TP53 allele. This event led to biallelic inactivation of NF1 andTP53 and LOH for the BRCA1 germline mutation. Subsequent CN alterations werefound in the dominant tumor clone in the left ovary and nearly 100% of tumor atother sites. Neurofibromin modeling studies suggested that the germline NF1mutation could potentially alter protein function. These results demonstrateearly, biallelic inactivation of neurofibromin in HGSOC and highlight thepotential of targeting RAS signaling in NF1 patients.DOI: 10.1016/j.gore.2018.01.005 PMCID: PMC5993517PMID: 29892687
