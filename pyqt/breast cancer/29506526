The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors for survival in black and white patients and to compare thesurvival of differentiated thyroid carcinoma subtypes between these two races. Wefurther investigated the association of lymph node and distant metastases withraces.METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis using data from the National CancerInstitute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. A total of70,346 cases were included in our study. Patients' demographics and cancer- andtreatment-related characteristics were compared between the black and whiteAmericans using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. For multivariate analysis,Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess the association betweenpotential risk factors and the survival in black and white patients.RESULT: Black Americans had a worse overall survival than white Americans(HR = 1.127, P = 0.002). While disease-specific survival (DSS) was comparable,the risk factors for DSS were different between white and black Americans. Black Americans had less lymph node metastasis of classical variant papillary thyroidcarcinoma (CPTC, OR = 0.476, P < 0.001) and follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC, OR = 0.522, P < 0.001), but not follicular thyroid carcinoma(FTC). However, black Americans with FVPTC, but not CPTC or FTC, had a higherpotential of distant metastasis (OR = 1.715, P = 0.026). Furthermore, only white patients with tumor > 2 cm and lymph node metastasis benefited from radioactiveiodine.CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors for DSS were significantly different in white andblack patients. The impact of race should be considered in treatment strategy forthyroid cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1340-7 PMCID: PMC5836433PMID: 29506526
