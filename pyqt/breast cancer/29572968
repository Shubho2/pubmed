Here, implantable,engineered 3D porous scaffolds are designed to generate synergistic actionbetween myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC)-depleting agents, which canaccommodate the establishment of a permissive immunogenic microenvironment tocounteract tumor-induced immunosuppression, and cancer vaccines consisting ofwhole tumor lysates and nanogel-based adjuvants, which can generate tumorantigen-specific T cell responses. The local peritumoral implantation of thesynthetic immune niche (termed immuneCare-DISC, iCD) as a postsurgical treatment in an advanced-stage primary 4T1 breast tumor model generates systemic antitumor immunity and prevents tumor recurrence at the surgical site as well as themigration of residual tumor cells into the lungs, resulting in 100% survival.These therapeutic outcomes are achieved through the inhibition ofimmunosuppressive MDSCs in tumors and spleens by releasing gemcitabine andrecruitment/activation of dendritic cells, enhanced population of CD4+ and CD8+ Tcells, and increased IFN-γ production by cancer vaccines from the iCD. Thiscombined spatiotemporal modulation of tumor-derived immunosuppression andvaccine-induced immune stimulation through the iCD is expected to provide animmune niche for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
