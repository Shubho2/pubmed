VEGF alsoworks as a multi-function molecule, which targets a variety of cell members inthe tumor microenvironment. We aimed to reveal VEGF-related molecular mechanisms on breast cancer cells. VEGF-knocked-out MDA-MB-231 cells (231VEGFKOex3 ) showed rounded morphology and shorter perimeter (1.6-fold, P<0.0001). 231VEGFKOex3 cellsalso showed impaired cell migration (2.6-fold, P=0.002). Bevacizumab treatmentdid not induce any change in morphology and mobility. Soluble neuropilin-1overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells (231sNRP1 ) exhibited rounded morphology andshorter perimeter (1.3-fold, P<0.0001). The 231sNRP1 cells also showed impairedcell migration (1.7-fold, P=0.003). These changes were similar to that of231VEGFKOex3 cells. As MDA-MB-231 cells express almost no VEGFR, these resultsindicate that the interaction between NRP1 and long isoform of VEGF containing a NRP-binding domain regulates the morphology and migration ability of MDA-MB-231cells. Genome-wide gene expression profiling identified ARHGAP17 as one of thetarget genes in the downstream of the VEGF/NRP1 signal. We also show thatVEGF/NRP1 signal controls filopodia formation of the cells by modulating Cdc42activity via ARHGAP17. According to the database of 1,980 breast cancer cases,the ratio of VEGF and SEMA3A in primary tumors of hormone-receptor-negativebreast cancer is associated with ARHGAP17 expression inversely, and with disease free survival. Altogether, the bevacizumab-independent VEGF/NRP1/ARHGAP17/Cdc42regulatory network plays important roles in malignant behavior of breast cancer. This article is protected by copyright.
