Electronic address: liupf2017@126.com.AIM: To investigate whether quantitative radiomics features extracted fromdynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) are associatedwith Ki67 expression of breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This institutional review board-approved retrospectivestudy comprised 377 Chinese women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2015. This cohort included 53 low-Ki67 expression (Ki67 proliferation indexless than 14%) and 324 cases with high-Ki67 expression (Ki67 proliferation index more than 14%). A binary-classification of low-versus high- Ki67 expression wasperformed. A set of 56 quantitative radiomics features, including morphological, greyscale statistic, and texture features, were extracted from the segmentedlesion area. Three machine learning classification methods, including naiveBayes, k-nearest neighbour and support vector machine, were employed for theclassification and the least absolute shrink age and selection operator (LASSO)method was used to select most predictive features set for the classifiers.Classification performance was evaluated by the area under receiver operatingcharacteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.RESULES: The model that used naive Bayes classification method achieved the best performance than the other two methods, yielding 0.773 AUC, 0.757 accuracy, 0.777sensitivity and 0.769 specificity. Three most predictive features, i.e.,contrast, entropy and line likeness, were selected by the LASSO method and showeda statistical significance (p<0.05) in the classification.CONCLUSION: The present study showed that quantitative radiomics imaging featuresof breast tumour extracted from DCE-MRI are associated with breast cancer Ki67expression. Future larger studies are needed in order to further evaluate thefindings.Copyright Â© 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
