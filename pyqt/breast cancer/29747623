We examined the associationbetween dietary patterns and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among Korean breast cancer survivors.METHODS: Our study included a total of 232 women, aged 21 to 79 years, who hadbeen diagnosed with stage I to III breast cancer and who underwent breast cancer surgery at least 6 months prior to our baseline evaluation. We assessed HRQoLusing the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality ofLife Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Quality of Life Questionnaire Breast Cancer Module 23 (QLQ-BR23). We conducted a factor analysis to identifythe major dietary patterns and used a generalized linear model to obtain theleast squares mean (LS mean) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for HRQoL accordingto the dietary pattern scores.RESULTS: We identified 2 major dietary patterns: the Healthy dietary pattern and the Western dietary pattern. We found that breast cancer survivors who had higherHealthy dietary pattern scores tended to have lower dyspnea scores but higherinsomnia scores, compared to breast cancer survivors with lower Healthy dietarypattern scores. For dyspnea, the LS mean (95% CI) was 8.86 (5.05-15.52) in thebottom quartile and 2.87 (1.62-5.08) in the top quartile (p for trend = 0.005).This association was limited to survivors with stage I for dyspnea or survivorswith stage II or III for insomnia.CONCLUSIONS: Healthy dietary patterns were associated with better scores fordyspnea but worse scores for insomnia among breast cancer survivors. Othercomponents of EORTC QLQ did not vary by dietary patterns overall, but theywarrant further investigation for subgroups of breast cancer survivors.DOI: 10.1186/s12905-018-0555-7 PMCID: PMC5946513PMID: 29747623
