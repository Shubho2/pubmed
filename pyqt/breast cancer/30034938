R. China.Tumor metastasis suppressor factor BRMS1 can regulate the metastasis of breastcancer and other tumors. Here we report scinderin (SCIN) as a noveltranscriptional target of BRMS1. SCIN protein belongs to the cytoskeletalgelsolin protein superfamily and its involvement in tumorigenesis remains largelyillusive. An inverse correlation between the expression levels of BRMS1 and SCIN was observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and tissues. On themolecular level, BRMS1 binds to SCIN promoter and exerts a suppressive role inregulating SCIN transcription. FACS analysis and caspase 9 immunoblot reveal thatknockdown of SCIN expression can sensitize HCC cells to chemotherapeutic drugs,leading to suppression of tumor growth in vivo. Consistently, overexpression ofSCIN protects cells from apoptotic death, contributing to increased xenograftedHCC cell growth. In summary, our study reveals SCIN as a functional apoptosisregulator as well as a novel target of BRMS1 during HCC tumorigenesis. Inhibitionof SCIN might bring a potential cancer therapy approach.PMCID: PMC6048394PMID: 30034938
