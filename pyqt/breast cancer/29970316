We present our results of postoperative radiation therapy for keloidswith various dose regimens.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review of 124 patients with 250 keloidlesions treated with postoperative radiation therapy was analyzed. In thisinstitutional review board-approved study, 125 keloids were treated to 20 Gy in 5fractions and 125 keloids were treated to 12 to 16 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions. Local failure was defined as redevelopment of any clinically apparent keloid at thetreated site. The median age was 34 years (14-84 years). Keloids were located on the ear (34%), neck/shoulder (19%), abdomen (13%), chest (10%), face (9%), breast(7%), extremities (4%), and back (3%). Median keloid size was 4 cm (0.5-20 cm).RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 40 months, the recurrence rate for all lesions was 5.6%. Lesions treated to 20 Gy had a recurrence rate of 1.6% compared with9.6% with <20 Gy and an odds ratio of 0.16 (P = .02). Upon univariate andmultivariate analysis there were no differences in recurrence rate with respectto location, race, gender, age, previously treated lesions, and presence ofmultiple keloids. The lone predictor for improved control rate was the dose of 20Gy in 5 fractions compared with less than that. Control rate for lesions treated to a biologically equivalent dose2 of 35 to 36 Gy2, 48 to 52.5 Gy2, and 60 to 72 Gy2 were 10% (P = .007), 8.9% (P = .16), and 1.6% (P = .02), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Surgical excision followed by immediate adjuvant radiation therapyfor keloids provides excellent local control and cosmesis. Treatment with abiologically equivalent dose2 > 60 (20 Gy in 5 fractions) yielded superior local control over lower dose regimens.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
