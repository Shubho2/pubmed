[Epub ahead ofprint]SREBP1, targeted by miR-18a-5p, modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition inbreast cancer via forming a co-repressor complex with Snail and HDAC1/2.Zhang N(1), Zhang H(1), Liu Y(1), Su P(2), Zhang J(1), Wang X(1), Sun M(3), Chen B(4), Zhao W(4), Wang L(4), Wang H(5), Moran MS(6), Haffty BG(7), Yang Q(8)(9).Author information: (1)Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Ji'nan,Shandong, China.(2)Department of Pathology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Ji'nan,Shandong, China.(3)Shandong Cancer Hospital affiliated to Shandong University, Ji'nan, Shandong, China.(4)Pathology Tissue Bank, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Ji'nan, Shandong,China.(5)State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-Sen University CancerCenter, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.(6)Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Yale University School of Medicine, NewHaven, CT, USA.(7)Department of Radiation Oncology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.(8)Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Ji'nan,Shandong, China. qifengy_sdu@163.com.(9)Pathology Tissue Bank, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Ji'nan, Shandong,China. qifengy_sdu@163.com.The progression of localized breast cancer to distant metastasis results in apoor prognosis and a high mortality rate. In this study, the contributions ofmiRNAs to tumor progression and the regulatory mechanisms leading to theirexpression alterations were investigated. Using highly lung-metastatic sub-lines from parental breast cancer cells, miRNA expression profiling revealed that themiR-17-92 cluster is significantly downregulated and the miR-18a-5p is the mostevidently decreased. Ectopic expression and inhibition of miR-18a-5p demonstratedits capacity in suppressing migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.Further research identified sterol regulatory element binding transcriptionprotein 1 (SREBP1), the master transcription factor that controls lipidmetabolism, as a candidate target of miR-18a-5p. SREBP1 is overexpressed andstrongly associated with worse clinical outcomes in breast cancer. FunctionallySREBP1 promotes growth and metastasis of breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo.To unravel the underlying mechanism of SREBP1-mediated metastasis, mRNA profilingand subsequent gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) were performed and SREBP1 was demonstrated to be significantly associated with epithelial-mesenchymaltransition (EMT). Furthermore, SREBP1-mediated repression of E-cadherin was foundto be deacetylation dependent and was augmented by recruiting Snail/HDAC1/2repressor complex. In the light of these data, we propose that reduced expressionof miR-18a-5p and concomitant overexpression of SREBP1 lead to induction of EMTstates that in turn, promote breast cancer progression and metastasis. Takentogether, our study reveals the crucial role of miR-18a-5p and SREBP1 in the EMT and metastasis, thus providing promising drug targets for tailored therapy in theadvanced breast cancer setting.DOI: 10.1038/s41418-018-0158-8 PMID: 29988076
