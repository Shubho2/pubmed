Recently, their presencehas been recognized in non-excitable cells such as cancer cells and theiroverexpression has been shown to be associated with metastatic behavior in avariety of human cancers. The neonatal isoform of the VGSC subtype, Nav1.5(nNav1.5) is overexpressed in the highly aggressive human breast cancer cellline, MDA-MB-231. The activity of nNav1.5 is known to promote the breast cancercell invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo, and its expression in primarymammary tumors has been associated with metastasis and patient death. Metastasis development is responsible for the high mortality of breast cancer and currently there is no treatment available to specifically prevent or inhibit breast cancer metastasis. In the present study, a 3D-QSAR model is used to assist thedevelopment of low micromolar small molecule VGSC blockers. Using this model, we have designed, synthesized and evaluated five small molecule compounds asblockers of nNav1.5-dependent inward currents in whole-cell patch-clampexperiments in MDA-MB-231 cells. The most active compound identified from thesestudies blocked sodium currents by 34.9 ± 6.6% at 1 μM. This compound alsoinhibited the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by 30.3 ± 4.5% at 1 μM concentrationwithout affecting the cell viability. The potent small molecule compoundspresented here have the potential to be developed as drugs for breast cancermetastasis treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
