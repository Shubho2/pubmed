We observed different patterns of PSMA expression between normaland cancerous tissues. Normal breast tissues showed PSMA expression only innormal glandular cells. However, primary breast tumors and distant metastasesshowed PSMA expression in tumor cells and in tumor-associated neovasculature.PSMA score group status in primary breast tumors was significantly associatedwith histologic type and tumor grade (p = 0.026 and p = 0.004 respectively).Distant metastases showed higher PSMA expression in tumor-associatedneovasculature comparing with primary tumors. Moreover, brain tumor-associatedneovasculture had significantly higher expression of PSMA comparing with bonetumor-associated neovasculture. The localized binding of PSMA mAb to theneovasculature endothelium was confirmed with the double Immunofluorescencestaining. 68Ga-PSAM imaging of a patient with metastatic breast cancer showedstrong tracer uptake in all known skeletal metastases. To the best of ourknowledge, this study is the second one that has assessed PSMA expression in alarge number of breast cancer patients. Our findings showed that PSMA isparticularly expressed in tumor-associated neovasculature of breast tumors andits distant metastases, thus enhancing the evidence on the potential usefulnessof PSMA as a therapeutic vascular target.DOI: 10.1007/s10585-018-9878-x PMID: 29426963
