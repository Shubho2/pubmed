Electronic address: Mqorbani79@yahoo.com.Several studies have been conducted on the relationship between dietaryinflammatory potential (DIP) and breast cancer. However, the findings areconflicting. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the findings on the association between DIP and the risk of breast cancer. We used relevantkeywords and searched online international electronic databases, including PubMedand NLM Gateway (for Medline), Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), andScopus for articles published through February 2017. All cross-sectional,case-control, and cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis.Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects meta-analysis method toaddress heterogeneity among studies. Findings were analyzed statistically. Ninestudies were included in the present systematic review and meta-analysis. Thetotal sample size of these studies was 296,102, and the number of participantsvaried from 1453 to 122,788. The random effects meta-analysis showed a positiveand significant association between DIP and the risk of breast cancer (pooledodds ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.27). The pooled effect size wasnot statistically significant because of the type of studies, including cohort(pooled relative risk, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.10) and case-control(pooled odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-2.37) studies. We found asignificant and positive association between higher DIP score and risk of breast cancer. Modifying inflammatory characteristics of diet can substantially reducethe risk of breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2018.01.007 PMID: 29486982
