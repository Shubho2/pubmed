We also examined Distress Thermometer scores according to cancersite.METHOD: A cross-sectional survey design: (i) secondary analysis of an existingHolistic Needs Assessment (HNA) and Distress Thermometer (DT) dataset was used,(ii) a survey of specialist nurse teams to identify their perceptions of patient concerns. Data collected between January 2015 and June 2016 from the HNA databasefrom one NHS Trust in England (n = 1233 patients). Specialist nurse teams forbreast, colorectal, gynaecology, skin and urology cancers identified the concernsthat they perceived their patients would report.RESULTS: The HNA showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.86). Acrossthe five cancer sites, nurses identified between 3 and 6 of the top ten concerns (TTC) expressed by patients, with wide variation across cancer sites. Nine of theTTC were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with a specific cancer site. Thebreast and gynaecological cancer groups both recorded significantly higher medianDistress Thermometer scores than the urology, skin and colorectal cancer groups(Kruskall-Wallis χ2 (4, n = 1228) 186.695, p=<.01).CONCLUSIONS: One of the aims of the eHNA is to enable service deliveryappropriate to patient needs. Our findings suggest that this will only beachieved if eHNA is examined, and services developed, by individual cancer site. The misconception of patient needs by specialist nurses underscores theimportance of review of information provided by patients during consultations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
