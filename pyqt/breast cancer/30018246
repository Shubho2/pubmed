To search for potential PPARγ activators, a compoundlibrary comprising 11 marine compounds was examined. Among them, a sterol,3β,11-dihydroxy-9,11-secogorgost-5-en-9-one (compound 1), showed the highestPPARγ activity with an IC50 value of 8.3 μM for inhibiting human breastadenocarcinoma cell (MCF-7) growth. Western blotting experiments showed thatcompound 1 induces caspase activation and PARP cleavage. In addition, compound 1 modulated the expression of various PPARγ-regulated downstream biomarkersincluding cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)6, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2),p38, and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Moreover, compound 1increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, upregulated thephosphorylation and expression of H2AX, and induced autophagy. Interestingly,pre-treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine rescued cells fromcompound 1-induced growth inhibition, which indicates that the cytotoxic effectof compound 1 is, in part, attributable to its ability to induce autophagy. Inconclusion, these findings suggest the translational potential of compound 1 inbreast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.3390/md16070238 PMCID: PMC6071057PMID: 30018246
