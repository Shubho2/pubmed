Immunohistochemical phenotype wasexamined. The clinicopathological relevance of the topographical pattern ofSA-BCs was analysed.RESULTS: Overall, up to 46 patients (25.6%) had contralateral cancer, either SAassociated or not. Of 99 cases who underwent core needle biopsy (CNB), 36 wereunderestimated as adenosis or atypical ductal hyperplasia at CNB, 5 invasivecases were misinterpreted as in situ carcinomas, whereas 4 ductal carcinoma insitu (DCIS) cases were overdiagnosed as invasive carcinoma. Microscopically, 163 tumours were in situ, including 136 DCIS, 19 lobular carcinomas in situ (LCIS)and 8 mixed DCIS/LCIS; of these carcinomas in situ (CIS), 37 had microinvasion.The DCIS group exhibited low, intermediate and high grades in 53.7%, 34.6% and11.8% of cases, respectively, mostly with solid (43.4%) or cribriform (41.9%)pattern. Forty out of 43 invasive cases were invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC),mostly DCIS predominant. Immunophenotypically, luminal A phenotype was identifiedin 55.1%, 63.2% and 45.0% of DCIS, LCIS and IDC cases, respectively.Topographical type A group (carcinoma being entirely confined to SA, n=176) wascharacterised by smaller size, less invasiveness, lower grade and more frequency of luminal A immunophenotype compared with type B group (≥ 50% but not all of thecarcinomatous lesion being located in SA, n=30) (all P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: CIS, especially non-high-grade DCIS, represents the most commonvariant of SA-BC, and luminal A is the most predominant immunophenotype. CNBassessment might be challenging in some SA-BCs. The topographical pattern hasgreat clinicopathological relevance. Careful evaluation of the contralateralbreast and long-term follow-up for patients with SA-BC is necessary given itshigh prevalence of bilaterality.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
