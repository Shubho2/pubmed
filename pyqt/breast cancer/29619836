We herein report thefirst north Han Chinese patient with CIPA who exhibited classic phenotypicfeatures and severe intellectual disability caused by a homozygous c.851-33T>Amutation of NTRK1, resulting in aberrant splicing and an open reading frameshift. We reviewed the literature and performed in silico analysis to determinethe association between mutations and intellectual disability in patients withCIPA. We found that intellectual disability was correlated with the specificNtrk1 protein domain that a mutation jeopardized. Mutations located peripheral tothe Ntrk1 protein do not influence important functional domains and tend to causemilder symptoms without intellectual disability. Mutations that involve critical amino acids in the protein are prone to cause severe symptoms, includingintellectual disability.DOI: 10.1177/0300060517747164 PMCID: PMC6023048PMID: 29619836
