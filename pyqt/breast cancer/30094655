A biocompatible nanocompositeconsisting of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and poly(glutamic acid) isplaced on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The sandwich assay relies on the useof a mucin 1 (MUC1)-binding aptamer that is first immobilized on the surface ofmodified GCE. Another aptamer (labeled with silver nanoparticles) is applied for secondary recognition of MCF-7 cells in order to increase selectivity and producean amplified signal. Differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry was used to follow the electrochemical signal of the AgNPs. Under the optimal condition, the sensor responds to MCF-7 cells in the concentration range from 1.0 × 102 to1.0 × 107 cells·mL-1 with a detection limit of 25 cells. We also demonstrate thatthe MUC1 tumor marker can be detected by the present biosensor. The assay ishighly selective and sensitive, acceptably stable and reproducible. This warrantsthe applicability of the method to early diagnosis of breast cancer. Graphicalabstract Schematic of the fabrication of an aptamer-based sandwich biosensor for Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 cells (MCF-7). A MWCNT-poly(glutamic acid)nanocomposite was used as a biocompatible matrix for MUC1-aptamer immobilization.Stripping voltammetry analysis of AgNPs was performed using aptamer conjugatedAgNPs as signalling probe.DOI: 10.1007/s00604-018-2918-z PMID: 30094655
