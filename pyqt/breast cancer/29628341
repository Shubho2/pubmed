Breast milk is an important route of HCMVtransmission in humans and we hypothesized that mammary epithelial cells could beone of the main cellular targets of HCMV infection.METHODS: The infectivity of primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) wasassessed following infection with the HCMV-DB strain, a clinical isolate with amarked macrophage-tropism. The impact of HCMV-DB infection on expression of p53and retinoblastoma proteins, telomerase activity and oncogenic pathways (c-Myc,Akt, Ras, STAT3) was studied. Finally the transformation of HCMV-DB infectedHMECs was evaluated using soft agar assay. CTH cells (CMV Transformed HMECs) weredetected in prolonged cultures of infected HMECs. Tumor formation was observed inNOD/SCID Gamma (NSG) mice injected with CTH cells. Detection of long non codingRNA4.9 (lncRNA4.9) gene was assessed in CTH cells, tumors isolated fromxenografted NSG mice and biopsies of patients with breast cancer usingqualitative and quantitative PCR.RESULTS: We found that HCMV, especially a clinical strain named HCMV-DB, infects HMECs in vitro. The clinical strain HCMV-DB replicates productively in HMECs asevidenced by detection of early and late viral transcripts and proteins.Following infection of HMECs with HCMV-DB, we observed the inactivation ofretinoblastoma and p53 proteins, the activation of telomerase activity, theactivation of the proto-oncogenes c-Myc and Ras, the activation of Akt and STAT3,and the upregulation of cyclin D1 and Ki67 antigen. Colony formation was observedin soft agar seeded with HCMV-DB-infected HMECs. Prolonged culture of infectedHMECs resulted in the development of clusters of spheroid cells that we calledCTH cells (CMV Transformed HMECs). CTH cells when injected in NOD/SCID Gamma(NSG) mice resulted in the development of tumors. We detected in CTH cells thepresence of a HCMV signature corresponding to a sequence of the long noncodingRNA4.9 (lncRNA4.9) gene. We also found the presence of the HCMV lncRNA4.9sequence in tumors isolated from xenografted NSG mice injected with CTH cells andin biopsies of patients with breast cancer using qualitative and quantitativePCR.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that key molecular pathways involved inoncogenesis are activated in HCMV-DB-infected HMECs that ultimately results inthe transformation of HMECs in vitro with the appearance of CMV-transformed HMECs(CTH cells) in culture. CTH cells display a HCMV signature corresponding to alncRNA4.9 genomic sequence and give rise to fast growing triple-negative tumorsin NSG mice. A similar lncRNA4.9 genomic sequence was detected in tumor biopsies of patients with breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
