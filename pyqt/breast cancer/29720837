The goal of the present work is to isolate and identifynew alkaloids from A. ingens as well as to assess the cytotoxic potential ofthese metabolites towards various cancer cell lines.Methods: The crude MeOH extract of the sponge was separated by vacuum liquidchromatography (VLC), using n-hexane, EtOAc, and MeOH. The EtOAc fraction waschromatographed on VLC, SiO2, sephadex LH-20, and RP18 columns, affording fourmetabolites. Their structures were identified using infrared, ultraviolet,high-resolution mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopictechniques, as well as comparison with the published data.Results: A new 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline (THβCs) alkaloid, ingenine F (4)and three known compounds: Annomontine (1), acanthomine A (2), and1-oxo-1,2,3,4-THβCs (3) were isolated and identified. Ingenine F (4) exhibitedcytotoxic activity toward hormone-dependent breast carcinoma (MCF7), coloncarcinoma (HCT116), and lung carcinoma (A549) cell lines with IC50 values of2.82, 1.00, and 2.37 μM, respectively, compared to doxorubicin (IC50 0.012,0.036, and 0.102 μM, respectively).Conclusion: It is the first report for the isolation of THβCs alkaloids from A.ingens. The THβCs alkaloid with N-methylbutyramide unit as found in ingenine F isvery rarely encountered in nature. Ingenine F may provide new promisingcandidates for potential cytotoxic agent.SUMMARY: Ingenine F, a new 1,2,3,4-THβCs derivative (4) and three known alkaloids(1-3) were isolated from A. ingens. Their structures were verified by variousspectroscopic analyses. Compound 4 had potent cytotoxic effect toward MCF7,HCT116, and A549 cancer cell lines.
