Epub 2018 Apr 5.The estrogen-related receptors in metabolism and cancer: newer insights.Ranhotra HS(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Biochemistry , St. Edmund's College , Shillong , India.The eukaryotic nuclear receptors (NRs) super-family of transcriptional factorsinclude the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) that have diverse roles in control of cellular energy balance, general metabolism, growth and development, immunity etc. Mouse knock-out models of specific ERR isoforms (ERRα, ERRβ and ERRγ)exhibit defects in several phenotypic traits. Newer findings indicate importantroles of ERRs in the regulation of brown adipocyte tissue mitochondrial oxidativefunctions as well as metabolic control in association with hypoxia-induciblefactors during cellular hypoxic state. Genes involved in cardiac metabolism isalso influenced by ERRα and ERRγ in association with the co-activators PGC-1α andPGC-1β. On the other hand, ERRs have crucial involvement at the interface ofmetabolism and diseases such as cancer. Recent findings have implicated ERRα inthe progression of tumor and malignancy of the breast, prostate, colon,endometrium etc. In this article, new insights into the regulatory role of ERRsin metabolism and cancer shall be reviewed.DOI: 10.1080/10799893.2018.1456552 PMID: 29619877
