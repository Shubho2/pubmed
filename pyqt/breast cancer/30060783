Concordance and discordance between their results was determined.RESULTS: There is 100% concordance between FISH and IHC in cases scoring 0, 1+(negative) and 3+ (positive) immunostaining. Tumour cases scoring 2+immunostaining showed amplification in 69.2% cases. All grade-I tumours werenon-amplified on FISH, while most of the grade-III tumours showed Her-2/neuamplification on FISH. There is significant association of Her-2/neu IHC withtumour grade and FISH (p<0.05). A fairly high proportion i.e. 69.7% of casesshowed Her-2/neu gene amplification. There was high concordance between Her-2/neutesting on IHC and FISH, (Kappa co-efficient 0.466, p <0.001).CONCLUSION: Her-2/neu amplification increases with increasing grade of breastcancer. A high proportion of Her-2/neu gene amplified cases indicates aggressive disease in that area and need for FISH testing on large scale, which is the gold standard for equivocal cases on immunohistochemistry.DOI: 10.29271/jcpsp.2018.08.581 PMID: 30060783
