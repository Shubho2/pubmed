The problem of postoperative pain as well as the highincidence of nausea and vomiting has led to the search for a better modality for pain management with fewer side effects. In the last few years, paravertebralblock (PVB) has gained immense popularity either in combination with GA or byitself for the anesthetic management of patients undergoing breast surgery.Context: Paravertebral block in breast surgery.Aims: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and duration of postoperativeanalgesia provided by ultrasound (USG)-guided PVB with bupivacaine and morphineversus bupivacaine and clonidine in patients undergoing modified radicalmastectomy (MRM).Subject and Methods: In the study, 70 patients who were scheduled for MRM wereenrolled and randomly divided into Group M (n = 35) and Group C (n = 35). Bothgroups received USG-guided PVB at T2-T3 after administering GA. Group M received 2 mg/kg 0.5% bupivacaine with 0.05 mg/kg morphine and Group C received 2 mg/kg0.5% bupivacaine with 1 Î¼g/kg clonidine in the block. Postoperatively, painintensity was recorded using the visual analog scale (VAS) (0-10 scale) at 1, 2, 6, 18, and 24 h duration when patients were resting and during a standardizedmovement. Modified Post Anaesthesia Discharge Scoring System was assessed at 1,2, 6, 18 and 24 h after surgery.Results: In this study conducted on 70 patients, VAS scores (both at rest and on movement) were found comparable at postoperative 1, 2, 6, 18, and 24 h (P >0.05). There was no statistical difference in comparing postanesthesiadischarging scoring in both the groups. No incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was seen in any group.Conclusions: Morphine and clonidine in PVB are equally effective, and there is nosuperiority of one agent over the other. Hence, both drugs may be used with equalefficacy as adjuvants to bupivacaine in PVB for providing postoperativeanalgesia.DOI: 10.4103/aer.AER_27_18 PMCID: PMC6020574PMID: 29962616
