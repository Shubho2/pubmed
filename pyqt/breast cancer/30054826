This results in high rates of positive margins and low rates of successful breast-conserving surgery. Wehypothesized that utilizing oncoplastic surgical techniques and selective shavemargins would be associated with lower positive margin rates and increased breastconservation in women with ILC.METHODS: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis in a large cohort of prospectively collected ILC cases who received surgical treatment at theUniversity of California, San Francisco, between 1992 and 2017. We identified allpatients with histologically proven, unilateral or bilateral, stage 1-3 ILC. The primary outcome was positive margin rates, defined as no ink on tumor.RESULTS: We identified 365 tumors in 358 women, with an average age of 61 years, who underwent breast-conserving surgery, and found that the use of oncoplastictechniques (odds ratio [OR] 0.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21-0.79,p = 0.008) and the selective use of shave margins (OR 0.393, 95% CI 0.22-0.7,p = 0.002) were significantly associated with lower positive margin rates, whenadjusted for tumor size and multifocality. The success rate forbreast-conservation surgery was 75%, with a 25% conversion rate to mastectomy.CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons should consider routine use of oncoplastic techniques andshave margins when performing breast-conservation surgery for women with ILC asthese methods are associated with significantly lower odds of having positivemargins and higher breast-conservation rates.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6682-4 PMID: 30054826
