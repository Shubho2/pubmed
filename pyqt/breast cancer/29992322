To help facilitate this process, we have developedKM-Express. KM-Express holds an extensive manually curated transcriptomic profileof 45 different datasets for prostate and breast cancer with phenotype andpathoclinical information, spanning from clinical samples to cell lines.KM-Express also contains The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets for 30 other cancertypes with matching cell line expression data for 23 of them. We presentKM-Express as a hypothesis generation tool for researchers to identify potential new prognostic RNA biomarkers as well as targets for further downstreamfunctional cell-based studies. Specifically, KM-Express allows users to comparethe expression level of genes in different groups of patients based on molecular,genetic, clinical and pathological status. Moreover, KM-Express aids the designof biological experiments based on the expression profile of the genes indifferent cell lines. Thus, KM-Express provides a one-stop analysis from benchwork to clinical prospects. We have used this tool to successfully evaluate theprognostic potential of previously published biomarkers for prostate cancer andbreast cancer. We believe KM-Express will accelerate the translation ofbiomedical research from bench to bed.Database URL:http://ec2-52-201-246-161.compute-1.amazonaws.com/kmexpress/index.php.DOI: 10.1093/database/bay069 PMCID: PMC6041744PMID: 29992322
