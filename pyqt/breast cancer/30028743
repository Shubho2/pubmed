Recenthigh-throughput genomic studies have revealed the complex mutational landscape ofthese rare diseases. These novel findings provide the grounds to a morecomprehensive classification of these diseases, reflected in the 2017 WHOclassification.RECENT FINDINGS: Our review is focused on selected PTCL entities.Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and other lymphomas derived from T follicular helper cells feature a rather homogeneous mutational landscape. These neoplasmsrecapitulate a multistep oncogenic process associating epigenetic deregulation,and second hit mutations affecting the T-cell receptor signaling pathway. Thismodel inferred from comprehensive analyses of patients samples, was confirmed in mouse models. Among ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphomas,translocation-associated subsets are found in both systemic and cutaneous types, and the newly described breast implant-associated type is usually indolent.Extranodal lymphomas of the innate immune system also harbor a combination ofmutations affecting different classes of epigenetic modifiers, andmutation-induced activation of the Janus Kinase/signal transduction and activatorof transcription pathway.SUMMARY: Understanding of PTCL pathogenesis has substantially improved, andoncogenic events have been identified. The current challenge is to mountefficient therapeutic strategies targeting these aberrations to improve patients'outcome.DOI: 10.1097/CCO.0000000000000474 PMID: 30028743
