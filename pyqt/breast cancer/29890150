Thisphase II multi-institutional study (WJOG5308L) was designed to evaluate thefeasibility of induction chemotherapy with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (50Gy) followed by surgery and postoperative consolidation chemotherapy in IIIA-N2NSCLC.METHODS: Patients with resectable c-stage IIIA-N2 were eligible, and pathologicalconfirmation of N2 disease was mandatory. Patients received chemotherapyconsisting of weekly carboplatin plus paclitaxel with concurrent radiotherapy (50Gy in 25 fractions). Unless disease progression, patients underwent surgicalresection, and thereafter received two courses of consolidation chemotherapy withcarboplatin plus paclitaxel. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved complete resection after induction chemo-radiotherapy (R0 rate).RESULTS: From December 2011 to November 2013, 40 eligible patients were enrolled.All patients completed induction chemo-radiotherapy with an overall response rateof 58%, and 32 patients achieved complete resection (R0 rate, 80%) mostly withlobectomy (N =27). Twenty patients (50%) completed the study treatment including postoperative chemotherapy. After the median follow-up period of 38 months, theprogression-free survival, overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates at2 years were 63 %, 75 %, and 62%, respectively. The 30-day and 90-day mortalitywere 0%.CONCLUSIONS: Induction chemotherapy with concurrent radiotherapy (50 Gy) followedby surgery was a feasible and promising treatment option for resectable c-stageIIIA-N2 NSCLC.Copyright Â© 2018.
