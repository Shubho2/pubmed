We hypothesized that OT through NF-κB inhibition can induce miR-195 up-regulation which it can promote the cell apoptosis and inhibit the cellproliferation. Thirty-two BALB/c female mice were equally divided into fourgroups to study the effects of OT and atosiban (ATO) (an oxytocin receptorantagonist) on the mammary tumor growth. The animal weight, OT plasmaconcentration, tumor weight and volume were measured, and the tumor-relatedsignaling pathways including NF-κB, miR-195, and Cyclin D1 were evaluated by qPCRassays, and Akt and ERK proteins were assessed by western blot at the end of the study. The volume and weight of tumors were significantly decreased after OTadministration. The phosphorylated Akt and ERK expressions were signiﬁcantlydecreased in the OT group compared to the tumor group. In contrast, thedephosphorylated Akt and ERK expressions were signiﬁcantly increased in the OTgroup in comparison with the tumor group. The mRNA expressions of miR-195, OTR,and Bax genes were significantly increased, and the mRNA expression of ERα, PI3K,NF-κB, cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 genes were decreased in the OT group in comparisonwith the tumor group. Interestingly, ATO administration reversed these effects.These results can exhibit a new therapeutic potential for OT on down-regulationof NF-κB and up-regulation of miR-195 and consequently, decrease of the tumorvolume and weight in a mouse model of breast cancer.Copyright © 2018.
