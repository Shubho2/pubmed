Patients were treated with YSJGG for 12weeks (12.4 g orally twice daily). The primary outcome was a change in the meanworst pain score of Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) over 12 weeks, andthe second outcomes included changes in pain severity and pain-relatedinterference of BPI-SF and Western Ontario and McMaster UniversitiesOsteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Modified Score for the Assessment of ChronicRheumatoid Affections of the Hands (M-SACRAH), the Functional Assessment ofCancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), bone mineral density (BMD) and blood indices suchas calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).RESULTS: Of 37 women recruited, 30 initiated the therapy and 24 were evaluable at12 weeks. The primary outcome (BPI-SF worst pain scores) achieved a 2.17-pointreduction compared with baseline (5.75±1.87 vs 3.58±2.15, P<0.01). There werereductions in pain severity (decreased 1.65, P<0.01) and pain-relatedinterference (decreased 2.55, P<0.01). The changes in WOMAC and M-SACRAH scoreswere similar to BPI-SF (P<0.05). In the FACT-B, only physical well-being andfunctional well-being were improved compared with baseline (P<0.05). No clinical differences were found in BMD, Ca, P and ALP.CONCLUSION: YSJGG is an effective and well-tolerated agent to reduce AIMSS.DOI: 10.1007/s11655-017-2928-4 PMID: 30062634
