Thesteep structure-activity relationship (SAR) requirements of the lead moleculeleft little scope to synthesise newer analogues. Here, newer MPA amides weredesigned, synthesised and evaluated for hIMPDH2 inhibition and cellular efficacy in breast, prostate and glioblastoma cell lines. Few title compounds exhibitedcellular activity profile better than MPA itself. The observed differences in theoverall biological profile could be attributed to improved structural andphysicochemical properties of the analogues over MPA. This is the first report ofthe activity of MPA derivatives in glioblastoma, the most aggressive braincancer.DOI: 10.1080/14756366.2018.1474211 PMCID: PMC6009919PMID: 29792360  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
