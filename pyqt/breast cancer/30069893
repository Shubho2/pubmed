Data were retrospectively reviewed from clinical records, pathologic reports, and imaging assessments. Imaging data included mammographic findings, B-mode US findings based on the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), and the mean andmaximum elasticity values on SWE. The final BI-RADS assessment, including thedegree of elasticity of the mass, was evaluated. Continuous variables wereexamined by an independent t test, and categorical variables were examined by theFisher exact test. The independent factors for predicting a histologic upgradewere evaluated by a multivariate logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Among the 80 lesions, 27 (33.8%) showed an invasive component aftersurgical excision. None of the BI-RADS US descriptors, which include shape,orientation, margin, and echogenicity, showed a significant correlation with the rate of a histologic upgrade to invasive cancer. However, the BI-RADS assessment category (P = .015) and nuclear grade (P = .005) were significantly correlatedwith invasiveness of the mass. The maximum stiffness value was lower in the pure DCIS group (119.04 vs 85.33 kPa; P = .041).CONCLUSIONS: The BI-RADS category based on US findings, maximum stiffness valueon SWE, and nuclear grade of DCIS are predictive of invasive components in DCIS.© 2018 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/jum.14722 PMID: 30069893
