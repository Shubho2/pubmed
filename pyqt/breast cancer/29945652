The varying role of regimens used as NACT needs to be investigated. Despiteavailability of some randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is unclear whichtreatment regimen suits best. Further, there is no study comparing all the three regimens. Accordingly, present study will compare the efficacy of anthracyclines,taxanes, and targeted therapy administered in neoadjuvant setting on the basis ofoncological outcomes and functional outcomes.METHOD/DESIGN: Online databases PubMed and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trialswill be searched to acquire eligible studies. Further, content of relevantjournals, references of relevant articles, and proceedings of major relatedconference will also be searched. The RCTs comparing any of abovementionedregimen as NACT on breast cancer patients will be eligible. Two reviewersindependently and in duplicate will screen the records on the basis of title and abstract and complete full-text review to determine eligibility. Similarly, data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be done by two independent reviewers.The pair-wise meta-analysis as well as network meta-analysis will be conducted toassess the relative efficacy of anthracyclines, taxanes, and targeted therapyregimens.DISCUSSION: The present systematic review will improve the understanding of therelative efficacies of the three treatment regimens and possibly guide theclinical practices by providing the current best evidence on the efficacy ofvarious regimens of NACT in the management of breast cancer patients.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO ( CRD42016027236 ).DOI: 10.1186/s13643-018-0754-1 PMCID: PMC6020442PMID: 29945652
