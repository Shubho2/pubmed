Doxorubicin (DOX)/BSA nanoparticles as cores have been prepared. Azeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) layer has been coated on the outersurface of the DOX/BSA core. The ZIF layer acts as a capsule for the safe storageof DOX under physiological conditions. An efficient pH-responsive drug deliverysystem using a BSA/DOX@ZIF, in which the drug is not released in PBS at pH 7.4but is released at low pH (5.0-6.0), has been constructed. Compared to the pureZIF, a better biocompatibility has been obtained using the BSA/DOX@ZIF. TheBSA/DOX@ZIF shows a much higher efficacy than free DOX against the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. The positive charges on the outer surface of the BSA/DOX@ZIFalso improve its cellular uptake.DOI: 10.1039/c8dt01789a PMID: 30014058
