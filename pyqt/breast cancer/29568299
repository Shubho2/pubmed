The function seems to be controversial, eitherwith positive, negative, or no significance in BC's prediction and prognosis.Moreover, B-cell infiltrates regulate tumor process through productions ofantibodies and interleukin-10. The interactions with other lymphocytes andprogrammed death-1/PD-1 ligand axis are also documented. The regulatorymechanisms will eventually be incorporated into diagnostic and therapeuticalgorithms, thus give guide to clinical treatment. In this review, we give newinsights into clinical impacts and regulatory mechanisms of tumor-infiltrating B cells, which heralds a new era in immuno-oncology in BC treatment.DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00470 PMCID: PMC5852074PMID: 29568299
