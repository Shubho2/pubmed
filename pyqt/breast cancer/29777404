All the patients were given ST either immediately after randomizationor after surgical resection of the intact primary tumor.RESULTS: The trial enrolled 274 patients: 138 in the LRT group and 136 in the ST group. Hazard of death was 34% lower in the LRT group than in the ST group(hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.88; p = 0.005).Unplanned subgroup analyses showed that the risk of death was statistically lowerin the LRT group than in the ST group with respect to estrogen receptor(ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)(+) (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.46-0.91; p = 0.01), humanepidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)/neu(-) (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.45-0.91; p = 0.01),patients younger than 55 years (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.38-0.86; p = 0.007), andpatients with solitary bone-only metastases (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.23-0.98;p = 0.04).CONCLUSION: In the current trial, improvement in 36-month survival was notobserved with upfront surgery for stage IV breast cancer patients. However, alonger follow-up study (median, 40 months) showed statistically significantimprovement in median survival. When locoregional treatment in de novo stage IVBC is discussed with the patient as an option, practitioners must consider age,performance status, comorbidities, tumor type, and metastatic disease burden.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6494-6 PMID: 29777404
