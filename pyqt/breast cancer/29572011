[Epub ahead of print]Analysis of circulating tumor DNA in breast cancer as a diagnostic and prognosticbiomarker.Rohanizadegan M(1).Author information: (1)Division of Genetics and Genomics, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard MedicalSchool, Boston, MA 02115, USA. Electronic address:mersedeh.rohanizadegan@childrens.harvard.edu.Despite all the advances in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, a largenumber of patients suffer from late diagnosis or recurrence of their disease.Current available imaging modalities do not reveal micrometastasis and tumorbiopsy is an invasive method to detect early stage or recurrent cancer,signifying the need for an inexpensive, non-invasive diagnostic modality.Cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) has been tried for early detection and targetedtherapy of breast cancer, but its diagnostic and prognostic utility is stillunder investigation. This review summarizes the existing evidence on the use ofctDNA specifically in breast cancer, including detection methods, diagnosticaccuracy, role in genetics and epigenetics evaluation of the tumor, andcomparison with other biomarkers. Current evidence suggests that increasinglevels of ctDNA in breast cancer can be of significant diagnostic value for earlydetection of breast cancer although the sensitivity and specificity of themethods is still suboptimal. Additionally, ctDNA allows for characterizing thetumor in a non-invasive way and monitor the response to therapy, althoughdiscordance of ctDNA results with direct biopsy (i.e. due to tumor heterogeneity)is still considered a notable limitation.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
