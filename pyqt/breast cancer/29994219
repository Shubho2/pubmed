Manual classification of mammogram images is a hard task because of thevariability of the tumor. It yields a noteworthy number of patients being called back to perform biopsies, ensuring no missing diagnosis. The convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN) has succeeded in a lot of image classification challenges duringthe recent years. In this paper, we proposed an approach of mammogram andtomosynthesis classification based on CNNs. We had acquired more than 3000mammograms and tomosynthesis data with approval from an institutional reviewboard at the University of Kentucky. Different models of CNNs were built toclassify both the 2-D mammograms and 3-D tomosynthesis, and every classifier was assessed with respect to truth-values generated by histology results from thebiopsy and two-year negative mammogram follow-up confirmed by expertradiologists. Our outcomes demonstrated that CNN-based models we had built andoptimized utilizing transfer learning and data augmentation have good potentialfor automatic breast cancer detection based on the mammograms and tomosynthesisdata.DOI: 10.1109/TNB.2018.2845103 PMID: 29994219
