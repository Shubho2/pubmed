Althoughthe efficacy of these therapies has been shown in recent studies,cost-effectiveness has not yet been determined in Japan.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of second-lineendocrine therapies for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR + andHER2 - mBC.METHODS: A Markov model was developed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of thetherapies over a 15-year time horizon from a public healthcare payer'sperspective. The efficacy and utility parameters were determined via a systematicsearch of the literature. Direct medical care costs were used. A discount rate of2% was applied for costs and outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed fornon-visceral metastasis. A series of sensitivity analyses, includingprobabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and threshold analysis were performed.RESULTS: Base-case analyses estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios(ICERs) of 3 million and 6 million Japanese yen (JPY)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for TOR and FUL 500 mg relative to EXE, respectively. FUL 250 mgand EXE + EVE were dominated. The overall survival (OS) highly influenced theICER. With a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 5 million JPY/QALY, theprobability of TOR being cost-effective was the highest. Subgroup analysis innon-visceral metastasis revealed 0.4 and 10% reduction in ICER from the base-caseresults of FUL5 500 mg versus EXE and TOR versus EXE, respectively, whilethreshold analysis indicated EVE and FUL prices should be reduced 73 and 30%,respectively.CONCLUSION: As a second-line therapy for postmenopausal women withHR +/HER2 - mBC, TOR may be cost-effective relative to other alternatives andseems to be the most favorable choice, based on a WTP threshold of 5 millionJPY/QALY. FUL 250 mg is expected to be as costly and effective as EXE. Thecost-effectiveness of EXE + EVE and FUL 500 mg could be improved by a large pricereduction. However, the results are highly sensitive to the hazard ratio of OS.Policy makers should carefully interpret and utilize these findings.DOI: 10.1007/s40273-018-0660-3 PMID: 29707743
