Therefore, early management of AEs is extremely important to obtain maximumtreatment outcome. We investigated here the effects of comprehensivepharmaceutical care for prevention of severe AEs on patient's quality-of-life(QOL) and continuation of therapy. QOL was assessed every month based on thefive-level version of EuroQol-5-Dimension (EQ-5D-5L). AEs were graded accordingto the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (ver 4.0). Implementationof comprehensive pharmaceutical care remarkably reduced the incidence of severeoral mucositis as compared with those without such interventions. EQ-5D-5L healthstates were almost constant during 6 months after intervention, ranging from0.850 to 0.889. Median time to treatment failure (TTF) was significantly longerafter intervention than before [224.0 days, 95% confidence interval (CI): 117-331days versus 34 days, 21-47 days, hazard ratio (HR): 0.027, 95% CI: 0.005 - 0.154,p<0.001]. These findings suggest that our comprehensive pharmaceutical care ishighly effective for enhancing treatment outcome by maintaining patient's QOL.DOI: 10.1691/ph.2018.7837 PMID: 29442014
