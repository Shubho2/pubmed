Despite various studies, the role and mechanism through which YAP mediates its tumor suppressor or oncogenic effectsare not yet fully understood. Therefore in the present study we aimed toinvestigate YAP at DNA, mRNA and protein level and also attempted to correlateour molecular findings with various clinicopathological variables of thepatients.METHODS: The study comprised of a total 137 genetically unrelated women withsporadic breast cancer cases and normal adjacent tissues not infiltrated withtumor. Mutation of YAP gene was analyzed by automated DNA sequencing. YAPpromoter methylation was studied using MS-PCR. Expression at mRNA and proteinlevel was studied using qPCR and IHC respectively.RESULTS: In our study YAP mRNA expression was found to be 8.65 Â± 6.17 folddownregulated in 67.15% cases. The expression of YAP when analyzed at the proteinlevel by IHC was found to be absent in 78.83% cases. Results from MS-PCR analysisshowed that YAP promoter methylation plays an important role in declining theexpression of YAP protein. The absence of YAP protein coincided with 86.60%methylated cases thereby showing a very strong correlation (p = 0.001). We alsoinvestigated YAP mutation at the major check point sites in the Hippo pathway andobserved no mutation. A significant association was observed on correlating mRNA expression with clinical stages (p = 0.038) and protein expression with ER status(p = 0.018) among Indian breast cancer patients.CONCLUSION: The expression of YAP was found to be downregulated in response toaberrant promoter methylation. The downregulation of YAP are consistent withprevious studies suggesting it to have a tumor suppressive role in breast cancer.We did not observe any mutation at the major check point sites in the Hippopathway.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4627-8 PMCID: PMC6031145PMID: 29970036
