Networks are a promising toolto elucidate intercellular interactions, yet exploration of these large-scalenetworks remains a challenge due to their high dimensionality. To retrieve andmine interactions, we developed CrosstalkNet, a user friendly, web-based network visualization tool that provides a statistical framework to infercondition-specific interactions coupled with a community detection algorithm for bipartite graphs to identify significantly dense subnetworks. As a case study, weused CrosstalkNet to mine a set of 54 and 22 gene-expression profiles from breasttumor and normal samples, respectively, with epithelial and stromal compartments extracted via laser microdissection. We show how CrosstalkNet can be used toexplore large-scale co-expression networks and to obtain insights into thebiological processes that govern cross-talk between different tumorcompartments.Significance: This web application enables researchers to minecomplex networks and to decipher novel biological processes in tumorepithelial-stroma cross-talk as well as in other studies of intercompartmentalinteractions.
