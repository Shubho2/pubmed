Based upon an internal audit showing suboptimal compliance with dosimetric parameters in whole breast irradiation (WBI), we conducted a mandatoryweb-based teaching conference for the network. This study reports the impact ofthis initiative on subsequent treatment plans.METHODS: Radiation treatment plans were collected for the 10 most recent patientsreceiving WBI at 16 institutions within the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center network.Subsequently, a web-based conference was conducted to educate staff physicians,physicists, and dosimetrists with goals for dose homogeneity and critical organdosimetry. Six months post-conference, another 10 plans were collected from each site and compared to pre-conference plans for deviations from dosimetriccriteria.RESULTS: Dose homogeneity significantly improved after the conference with breastV105% decreasing from 15.6% to 11.2% (p = 0.004) and breast V110% decreasing from1.3% to 0.04% (p = 0.008). A higher percentage of cases were compliant withdosimetric criteria, with breast V105% > 20% decreasing from 22.5% to 7.5% ofcases (p = 0.0002) and breast V110% > 0% decreasing from 13.8% to 4.4% of cases(p = 0.003).CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a web-based teaching conference helped improveadherence to clinical pathway dosimetric guidelines for WBI. In radiationoncology networks, this may be an effective model to ensure quality in routinepractice and can be extrapolated to other disease sites.DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-0995-0 PMCID: PMC5857077PMID: 29548340
