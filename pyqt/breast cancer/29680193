We showed the feasibility ofcombining the SRC inhibitor dasatinib with weekly paclitaxel in patients withmetastatic breast cancer (MBC) and herein report the subsequent phase II trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients had received ≤ 2 chemotherapy regimens formeasurable, HER2-negative MBC. Patients received paclitaxel and dasatinib (120 mgdaily) and were assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in SolidTumors for overall response rate (ORR), the primary end point. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). A 30% ORR (n = 55) was deemed worthy of further investigation. Exploratory biomarkersincluded N-telopeptide (NTX) and plasma vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF)receptor 2 as predictors of clinical benefit.RESULTS: From March 2010 to March 2014, 40 patients, including 2 men enrolled.The study was stopped early because of slow accrual. Overall, 32 patients (80%)had estrogen receptor-positive tumors and 23 (58%) had previously receivedtaxanes. Of the 35 assessable patients, 1 (3%) had complete response and 7 (20%) partial response, resulting in an ORR of 23%. The median PFS and OS was 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-9.9) and 20.6 (95% CI, 12.9-25.2) months,respectively. As expected, fatigue (75%), neuropathy (65%), and diarrhea (50%)were common side effects, but were generally low-grade. Median baseline NTX wassimilar in patients who had clinical benefit (8.2 nmol BCE) and no clinicalbenefit (10.9 nmol BCE). Similarly, median baseline VEGF levels were similarbetween the 2 groups; 93.0 pg/mL versus 83.0 pg/mL.CONCLUSION: This phase II study of dasatinib and paclitaxel was stopped earlybecause of slow accrual but showed some clinical activity. Further study is notplanned.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2018.03.010 PMID: 29680193
