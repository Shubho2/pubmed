Cancer cell-secreted microvesicles (MVs) contribute immenselyin disease propagation. These nano-vesicles, generated from plasma membraneoutward budding are taken up by nearby healthy cells thereby inducing phenotypic alterations in those recipient cells. Protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2),activated by trypsin, also contributes to cancer progression by increasingmetastasis, angiogenesis etc. Here, we report that PAR2 activation promotespro-metastatic MVs generation from human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231.Rab5a, located at the plasma membrane plays vital roles in MVs biogenesis. Weshow that PAR2 stimulation promotes AKT phosphorylation which activates Rab5a by converting inactive Rab5a-GDP to active Rab5a-GTP. Active Rab5a polymerizes actinwhich critically regulates MVs shedding. Not only MVs generation, has this Rab5a activation also promoted cell migration and invasion. We reveal that Rab5a isover-expressed in human breast tumor specimen and contributes MVs generation inthose patients. The involvement of p38 MAPK in MVs-induced cell metastasis hasalso been highlighted in the present study. Blockade of Rab5a activation can be apotential therapeutic approach to restrict MVs shedding and associated breastcancer metastasis.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25725-w PMCID: PMC5943449PMID: 29743547
