However, TEA andPVB are associated with a risk of serious complications, such as pneumothorax,hypotension, or nerve damage. Retrolaminar paravertebral block (RLB) wasintroduced as a new alternative to PVB. This new approach might lower the risk ofserious complications, but its use has not been well established yet. Therefore, we conducted a double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial toevaluate the efficacy of a double-level RLB for postoperative analgesia afterbreast cancer surgery. A total of 122 women who underwent breast cancer surgerywith axillary lymph node dissection under general anesthesia were allocated into RLB group (60 patients) and Control group (62 patients). RLB was performed uponsurgery completion with 15 ml ropivacaine (0.5%) for each lamina of the T2 and T4vertebrae. In Control group, the same volume of normal saline was injected ateach level. The time to first postoperative analgesic administration wassignificantly longer in RLB group than that in Control group (161.5 min vs. 64.0 min). The pain score in RLB group was significantly lower immediately aftersurgery. However, the number of patients requiring analgesics during the 12-hour post-surgical period was similar between RLB group (20 patients) and Controlgroup (22 patients). In conclusion, the double-level RLB could delay the time to initial administration of analgesics, but this technique may be insufficient toreduce the analgesic requirement within the 12-hour postoperative periodfollowing breast cancer surgery.DOI: 10.1620/tjem.245.179 PMID: 30012909
