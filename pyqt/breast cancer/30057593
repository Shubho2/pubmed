Herein, we report for the first time on anticancer potential of phytogenic platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs)and palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) using a medicinal plant Gloriosa superbatuber extract (GSTE). The synthesis of the nanoparticles was completed within 5hours at 100°C which was confirmed by development of dark brown and black colour for PtNPs and PdNPs, respectively, along with enhancement of the peak intensityin the UV-visible spectra. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy(HRTEM) showed that the monodispersed spherical nanoparticles were within a size range below 10 nm. Energy dispersive spectra (EDS) confirmed the elementalcomposition, while dynamic light scattering (DLS) helped to evaluate thehydrodynamic size of the particles. Anticancer activity against MCF-7 (humanbreast adenocarcinoma) cell lines was evaluated using MTT assay, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. PtNPs and PdNPs showed 49.65 ± 1.99% and 36.26 ± 0.91%of anticancer activity. Induction of apoptosis was most predominant in theunderlying mechanism which was rationalized by externalization of phosphatidylserine and membrane blebbing. These findings support the efficiency of phytogenicfabrication of nanoscale platinum and palladium drugs for management and therapy against breast cancer.DOI: 10.1155/2018/4924186 PMCID: PMC6051271PMID: 30057593
