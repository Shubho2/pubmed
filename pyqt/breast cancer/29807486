There isa current gap in knowledge regarding why palliative care is underutilizednationwide.OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors associated with palliative care use amongdeceased patients with solid cancer tumors.METHODS: Using the 2016 National Cancer Data Base, we identified deceasedpatients (2004-2013) with breast, colon, lung, melanoma, and prostate cancer.Data were described as percentages. Associations between palliative care use and patient, facility, and geographic characteristics were evaluated throughmultivariate logistic regression.RESULTS: A total of 1 840 111 patients were analyzed; 9.6% received palliativecare. Palliative care use was higher in the following patient groups: survival>24 months (17% vs 2%), male (54% vs 46%), higher Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score(16% vs 8%), treatment at designated cancer programs (74% vs 71%), lung cancer(76% vs 28%), higher grade cancer (53% vs 24%), and stage IV cancer (59% vs 13%).Patients who lived in communities with a greater percentage of high schooldegrees had higher odds of receiving palliative care; Central and Pacific regionsof the United States had lower odds of palliative care use than the East Coast.Patients with colon, melanoma, or prostate cancer had lower odds of palliativecare than patients with breast cancer, whereas those with lung cancer had higher odds.CONCLUSIONS: Palliative care use in solid cancer tumors is variable, with apreference for patients with lung cancer, younger age, known insurance status,and higher educational level.DOI: 10.1177/0825859718777320 PMID: 29807486
