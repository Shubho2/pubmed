Because of its rarity, the immunophenotypic and genetic profile of LGASC has not been sufficientlycharacterised. The aim of this study was to gain insights into the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of LGASC.METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the clinical and morphological features anddetailed the immunohistochemical characteristics of a retrospective series of 13 LGASCs. Targeted sequencing of 50 genes was performed in 10 of 13 cases.Identified mutations were further assessed by Sanger sequencing in a validationseries of 11 additional cases. All tumours showed a triple-negativeimmunophenotype, expressed 'basal' keratins, showed variable levels of epidermal growth factor receptor expression, and did not express androgen receptor.Sequencing analysis of the screening set of LGASCs revealed a high rate (seven of10 cases) of PIK3CA mutations, whereas no TP53 mutations were found. All PIK3CAmutations were missense mutations located either in exon 20 (n = 6) or in exon 9 (n = 1). The global PIK3CA mutation rate, including the validation series, was52% (11 of 21 cases). No disease recurrences were observed. [Correction added on 11 June 2018, after first online publication: The percentage of mutation rate wascorrected to 52%] CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that LGASC of the breast is alow-grade triple-negative breast cancer that harbours a basal-like phenotype withno androgen receptor expression, and shows a high rate of PIK3CA mutations but noTP53 mutations.© 2018 The Authors.
