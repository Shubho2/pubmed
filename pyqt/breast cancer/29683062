Thepurpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences ofweight-concerned women treated for early-stage breast cancer. A purposeful sampleof women were selected based on criteria for high weight and body image concerns ( n = 11; Mage = 65.31 Â± 10.96 years). Each participant engaged in a one-on-onesemi-structured interview. Five themes were identified: weight concernscontributed to psychological distress, prevalent history of weight cycling andongoing quest to manage weight, shifting psychological impact of cancer versusweight, perceptions of failure around goal-oriented weight management behaviors, and internalized and explicit social pressures for weight loss in the context of risk reduction. In light of the fundamental challenges of weight management, and the present findings, improving weight-related distress should be a clinicalpriority to improve the well-being of women in survivorship.DOI: 10.1177/1049732318770403 PMID: 29683062
