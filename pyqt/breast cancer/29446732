Maximum absorbance was observed at 420 nm due to the presence of characteristic surface Plasmon resonance of nano silver by UV-visiblespectroscopy. The role of various functional groups in the bio-reduction ofsilver and chemical transformation was verified by Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy (FTIR). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersiveX-ray spectroscopy (EDX) predict the shape (rocky, flack type, ellipsoidal,etc.), size (68 nm) and elemental composition (Ag as a major constituent) of the biosynthesized AgNPs, respectively.RESULTS: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis further corroborated themorphology of the AgNPs. Color mapping and atomic force microscopy (AFM)confirmed the nano-sized topography. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) showedthe charge, stability, and size of the AgNPs. The generated AgNPs presentedpotential antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negativebacterial strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, andHaemophilus influenzae. The biosynthesized AgNPs also showed antiproliferativeactivity against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line in a dosedependent manner.CONCLUSION: In conclusion, results clearly indicate that biosynthesized AgNPscould be used as effective nano drug for treating infectious diseases caused bymultidrug resistant bacterial strains in the near future.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1389201019666180214145421 PMID: 29446732
