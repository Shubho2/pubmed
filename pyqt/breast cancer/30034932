Unlike other members of VGLL family, VGLL4 wasdescribed as a novel tumor suppressor containing two TDU motifs. VGLL4 executesits biological function through two TDU domains via interacting with TEA domain(TEAD) transcription factors. Lower expression of VGLL4 usually indicates poorsurvival in many cancers, such as lung cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer,colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and esophagealsquamous cancer. In cancer cells, the expression of VGLL4 is lower than that ofnormal tissues, moreover, expression level of VGLL4 is positively related tosurvival rate. VGLL4 is found to play an important role in several signalpathways, mainly acts as a tumor suppressor interacting with TEADs. In Hipposignaling pathway, VGLL4 competes with YAP in binding to TEADs and inhibits thedownstream of YAP. In Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, VGLL4 negatively regulatesWnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via inhibiting β-catenin and TCF (T-cell factor).VGLL4 can also suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and contribute toapoptosis signaling pathway.PMCID: PMC6048398PMID: 30034932
