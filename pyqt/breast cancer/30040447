Resveratrol has antitumor property for breastcancer cells. 99mTc-MIBI has higher absorption rate in human breast cancer cellline MCF-7. In the present study, the authors intend to investigate the effect ofDOX and resveratrol on the absorption of 99mTc-MIBI in breast cancer cellxenografts in mice.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen xenograft models in nude mice were divided intofour groups. Group I (S, control) received 2% DMSO in 0.9% saline, group II (D)2.5 mg/kg DOX, group III (D + R) 20 mg/kg/d resveratrol with 2.5 mg/kg DOX (totaldose of 15 mg/kg in six injections), and group IV (R) 20 mg/kg/d resveratrol for 2 weeks. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were taken forthe determination of 99mTc-MIBI absorption. Mice were sacrificed, and thepercentage of injected dose per gram (%ID/g) of the heart, liver, tumor, andmuscle was measured using a gamma counter. Hematoxylin-eosin staining andMasson's trichrome staining were used for investigation of histopathologicalchanges.RESULTS: The %ID/g of tumor was lowest in group D + R. The severity of tumornecrosis or apoptosis was highest in group D + R, but there is no significantdifference in pathological injuries and %ID/g of tumor between the group D + Rand group D. In addition to the results of the %ID/g, the severity ofpathological injuries to the liver and heart cells in group D + R was highercompared with group D. There is a significant difference in the %ID/g of theliver between the group D + R and group D. SPECT images showed that the lowestamount of %ID/g was observed in the tumor of group D + R.CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of pathology, biodistribution study, andimaging, the combination of DOX and resveratrol has shown higher antitumoreffect; hence, 99mTc-MIBI can be used to evaluate their antitumor effect.DOI: 10.1089/cbr.2018.2523 PMID: 30040447
