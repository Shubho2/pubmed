Electronic address:cf99@cornell.edu.Bone metastasis is a leading cause of death in patients with breast cancer, butthe underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. While much work focuses on themolecular and cellular events that drive breast cancer bone metastasis, it ismostly unclear what role bone extracellular matrix (ECM) properties play in this process. Bone ECM primarily consists of mineralized collagen fibrils, which arecomposed of non-stoichiometric carbonated apatite (HA) and collagen type I.Reduced bone mineral content is epidemiologically linked with increased risk ofbone metastasis. Yet elucidating the potential functional impact of collagenmineralization on breast cancer cells has remained challenging because of a lack of model systems that allow studying tumor cell behavior as a function ofphysiological, intrafibrillar collagen mineralization. Here, we have developedcell culture substrates composed of mineralized collagen type I fibrils using apolymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) process. Intrafibrillar HA decreasedbreast cancer cell adhesion forces and accordingly reduced collagen fiberalignment relative to cells cultured on control collagen. The resultingmineral-mediated changes in collagen network characteristics and mechanosignalingcorrelated with increased cell motility, but inhibited directed migration ofbreast cancer cells. These results suggest that physiological mineralization ofcollagen fibrils reduces tumor cell adhesion with potential functionalconsequences on skeletal homing of disseminated tumor cells in early stages ofbreast cancer metastasis.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
