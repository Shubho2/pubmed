Our study aimed toexamine expression of the lncRNA MAGI2-AS3 in breast cancer and to explore itsfunction in cancer cell growth. First, MAGI2-AS3 expression levels in clinicalsamples and cell lines were determined by quantitative reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The functional significance ofMAGI2-AS3 in cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis was then examined in vitro. Our results showed MAGI2-AS3 to be down-regulated in breast cancer tissuescompared to normal adjacent tissues. Moreover, MAGI2-AS3 markedly inhibitedbreast cancer cell growth and increased expression of Fas and Fas ligand (FasL). In conclusion, our data suggest that MAGI2-AS3 expression is decreased in breast cancer and that MAGI2-AS3 plays an important role as a tumour suppressor bytargeting Fas and FasL signalling. These results provide new insight into novelclinical treatments for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s13577-018-0206-1 PMID: 29679339  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
