Activation by oestrogen(17Î²-oestradiol; E2) initiates short term, non-genomic, signalling events both invitro and in vivo. Published literature on the prognostic value of GPER proteinexpression in breast cancer indicates that further assessment is warranted. Weshow, using immunohistochemistry on a large cohort of primary invasive breastcancer patients (n=1245), that low protein expression of GPER is not onlysignificantly associated with clinicopathological and molecular features ofaggressive behaviour but also significantly associated with adverse survival ofbreast cancer patients. Furthermore, assessment of GPER mRNA levels in theMETABRIC cohort (n=1980) demonstrates that low GPER mRNA expression issignificantly associated with adverse survival of breast cancer patients. Usingartificial neural networks, genes associated with GPER mRNA expression wereidentified; these included notch-4 and jagged-1. These results support theprognostic value for determination of GPER expression in breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25408 PMCID: PMC5995224PMID: 29899833
