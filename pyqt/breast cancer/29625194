Electronic address: azwfu@zjut.edu.cn.AIMS: The interaction of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) with the immune systemand the possibility of inflammation induction are of particularly interest.Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) are one of the most popularmanufactured nanomaterials. In this study, we focused on the immune-modulatoryeffect of commercial P-25 TiO2 NPs in vivo and in vitro and their crucial role incancer metastasis.MAIN METHODS: The female C57BL/6 mice were injected into abdominal cavity withPBS or P-25 TiO2 to investigate the immune-modulatory function of P-25. Andbreast cancer cells were intravenously (i.v.) injected into mouse to establishthe liver and lung cancer metastasis model. Peritoneal macrophage was used toinvestigate the macrophage polarization in vitro.KEY FINDINGS: Results showed us that peritoneal macrophage exposed to P-25 TiO2NPs displayed activated M1 macrophage response, as evidenced by the increasedmRNA expression of interleukin-1β (IL1β), IL6, TNFα, CCR7 and inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS). After exposure of TiO2 NPs in vivo for 21 days, the bodyweights of mice decreased significantly, which were accompanied by aninfiltration of immune cells in liver and spleen in 20 mg/kg BW treated group.Importantly, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in liver, spleen andthe serum were amplified, which indicated the tissue and systemic inflammationinduced by TiO2 NPs. In addition, the activation of immune response induced byP-25 TiO2 NPs was correlated with their ability to inhibit cancer metastasis.SIGNIFICANCE: Our results delineated the stimulating pro-inflammatory responseinduced by P-25 TiO2 NPs and their outcome in vivo for cancer metastasis.Copyright © 2018.
