Breast reconstruction following mastectomy can be performed withprosthetic devices or autologous tissue. In the UK implant-based breastreconstruction following mastectomy is the most common type of breastreconstruction, estimated to account for 70% of the reconstructive caseload inthe UK. Since 2001 there has been a considerable increase in the number ofprosthetic reconstructions performed with the use of mesh or matrix to augmentthe reconstructive pocket. This article introduces the main types of mesh andmatrix used in implant-based breast reconstruction, reconstructive techniques andreviews the benefits and complications associated with their use.DOI: 10.12968/hmed.2018.79.8.454 PMID: 30070945
