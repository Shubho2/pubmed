However, biological effects occurring in cells, especially those which are drug resistant, have not been studied thoroughly. This study presentsresponse of wild and drug resistant breast cancer cells to classical photodynamictherapy with Photofrin or experimental photodynamic therapy with cyanine IR-775, combined with electroporation. Photodynamic reaction or electroporation alone hadno cytotoxic effect, but their combination significantly disturbed cellularfunctions. Applying electroporation allowed the drugs to increase itsaccumulation, especially for a poorly permeant cyanine in drug resistant cells.FACS analysis showed that even at relatively mild electric field, ca. 90% ofcells were permeabilized. High intracellular concentration of drugs triggered thecellular defense system through increased expression of glutathione S-transferaseand multidrug resistance proteins (MDR1 and MRP7), particularly in drug resistantcells. Finally, expressively decreased cell metabolism and proliferation, as wellas formation of apoptotic bodies and fragmentation of cells were observed afterthe combined treatment. The results show that electroporation can be used foreffective delivery of photosensitizers, even to drug resistant breast cancercells, which was not tested before. This shows that electro-photodynamictreatment could be a promising approach to overcome a problem of drug resistance in cancer cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
