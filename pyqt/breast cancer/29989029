It regulates cancer growth, invasion andspread by several signaling pathways, and has a role in stem cell biology andother diseases. This review summarizes TROP-2's properties, especially in cancer,and particularly its role as a target for antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) orimmunotherapy. When the irinotecan metabolite, SN-38, is conjugated to ahumanized anti-TROP-2 antibody (sacituzumab govitecan), it shows potent broadanticancer activity in human cancer xenografts and in patients with advancedtriple-negative breast, non-small cell and small-cell lung, as well as urothelialcancers.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25615 PMCID: PMC6034748PMID: 29989029
