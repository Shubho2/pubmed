This study aims toinvestigate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components among primarybreast cancer and control population. The clinical data of metabolic syndrome andits components in the breast cancer (605 cases) and control population (3212cases), from Breast Cancer Center and Physical Examination Center of Chongqing,China, from July 2015 to February 2017, were collected for comparative analysis. This study was prospectively registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry(http://www.chictr.org.cn/, number: ChiCTR-OOB-15007543). The prevalence ofmetabolic syndrome in breast cancer (32.6%) was obviously higher than that incontrol population (18.2%) (p<0.001; OR: 2.173, 95%CI: 1.793 to 2.633). With age stratification, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in breast cancer group aged below 60 years (24.9%, p<0.001; OR: 2.216, 95%CI: 1.744 to 2.816) and equal/above60 years (58.3%, p<0.001; OR: 2.291, 95%CI: 1.580 to 3.322) were alsostatistically higher than those (13.0% & 37.9%) in control population,respectively. Breast cancer women were more likely to have preobese (BMI25.0-29.9) or obesity (BMI â‰¥30.0), broader waist circumference, lower HDL-Clevel, higher systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure and higher fasting bloodglucose level compared to the control population, corresponding prevalence were31.7%vs.19.4%, 76.0%vs.29.6%, 37.4%vs.30.4%, 34.2%/27.3%vs.27.6%/14.2% and25.0%vs.20.1%, respectively (p<0.01). In summary, there is high prevalence ofmetabolic syndrome and its components in Chinese breast cancer women, andmetabolic syndrome is closely related with breast cancer. Therefore, screeningand prevention strategy of metabolic syndrome should be carried out in themanagement of breast cancer.DOI: 10.7150/jca.22968 PMCID: PMC5820922PMID: 29483960
