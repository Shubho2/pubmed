Electronic address:khaled.ahmed@pharm.bsu.edu.eg.A novel series of spirobenzo[h]chromene and spirochromane derivatives wasdesigned, synthesized and evaluated as potential anticancer agents against MCF-7 (human breast carcinoma), HT-29 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma) and A549 (humanlung carcinoma) cell lines using MTT assay. Eight compounds 7, 8e, 13a-e and 16showed a better anticancer activity than that of sorafenib, the multi-kinaseinhibitor with IC50 values between 1.78 and 5.47 μM or erlotinib with IC50 valuesover 20 μM. Representative compounds 8e, 13c and 16 were selected for furthermechanistic investigation via EGFR, B-RAF and tubulin polymerization assays.Compound 16 was the most potent EGFR inhibitor (IC50 = 1.2 μM), yet compounds 8e,13c and 16 displayed moderate tubulin polymerization inhibition effects.Molecular docking studies of those compounds revealed their possible bindingmodes into the active sites of both EGFR and B-RAF kinases. The newly developedcompounds represent a therapeutically promising approach for the treatment ofdifferent types of cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
