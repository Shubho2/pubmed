Separase is an emerging target forcancer therapy, and separase enzymatic inhibitors such as sepin-1 are currentlybeing developed to treat separase-overexpressed tumors. Drug metabolism plays acritical role in the efficacy and safety of drug development, as well as possibledrug-drug interactions. In this study, we investigated the in vitro metabolism ofsepin-1 in human, mouse, and rat liver microsomes (RLM) using metabolomicapproaches. In human liver microsomes (HLM), we identified seven metabolitesincluding one cysteine-sepin-1 adduct and one glutathione-sepin-1 adduct. All thesepin-1 metabolites in HLM were also found in both mouse and RLM. Usingrecombinant CYP450 isoenzymes, we demonstrated that multiple enzymes contributed to the metabolism of sepin-1, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 as the majormetabolizing enzymes. Inhibitory effects of sepin-1 on seven major CYP450s werealso evaluated using the corresponding substrates recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration. Our studies indicated that sepin-1 moderately inhibitsCYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 with IC50 < 10 μM but weakly inhibits CYP2B6,CYP2C8/9, and CYP2D6 with IC50 > 10 μM. This information can be used to optimize the structures of sepin-1 for more suitable pharmacological properties and topredict the possible sepin-1 interactions with other chemotherapeutic drugs.DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00313 PMCID: PMC5949348PMID: 29867452
