China.Here, we provide direct evidence that using recombinant proteins expressed ineukaryotic cells as antigen is a practical way to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against heavily glycosylated proteins. Heavily glycosylated proteins aretypically difficult targets for mAb generation, being limited by unsatisfactoryaffinity and low specificity. Using the heavily glycosylated CD45 protein as anexample, we demonstrate the entire process of expressing the protein ineukaryotic cells and using it as an antigen to generate CD45-targeting mAbs inmice. The mAbs generated showed robust affinity and specificity, which arecrucial factors for differentiate circulating tumor cells from white blood cells in human breast cancer patient samples. Only 1 cell fusion and 2 cyclicsub-cloning steps were necessary before mAbs with satisfactory performance wereobtained.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0192506 PMCID: PMC5806877PMID: 29425242  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
