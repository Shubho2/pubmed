The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic valueof interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression in invasive breast cancer.Interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expressions were assessed by immunohistochemistryin tissue microarrays of 1283 invasive breast cancer samples, and associationsbetween these expressions and clinicopathological variables and clinical outcomeswere investigated. Interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression was observed in 138(10.8%) samples, and found to be associated with positive estrogen receptor(p < 0.001) and progesterone receptor (p < 0.001) and with the luminal subtype(p < 0.001). No significant association was found between interleukin-13 receptoralpha 2 expression and other clinicopathological variables including age, tumorsize, lymph node metastasis, histologic types, histologic grade, HER2 status,Ki-67 labeling index, or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes levels. Patients withinterleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression tended to have poorer disease-freesurvival, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.069).Subgroup analysis showed luminal breast cancer patients positive forinterleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression had significantly poorer disease-free survival (p = 0.018) than luminal breast cancer patients negative forinterleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression. However, no association betweeninterleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression and clinical outcome was observed inHER2-positive and triple-negative subgroups (p = 0.574 and p = 0.936,respectively). Multivariate analysis showed interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for luminal breast cancer(p = 0.03). This study shows interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 expression could be a useful prognostic marker for selecting patients with luminal breast cancerlikely to follow a clinically aggressive course despite receiving systemictherapy.DOI: 10.1177/1010428318783657 PMID: 29911489  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
