There were 67totally implantable venous access ports with a 6.5F catheter and 142 totallyimplantable venous access ports with an 8F catheter. Medical records wereretrospectively reviewed. The presence of significant left innominate veinstenosis and tip location of the catheter was evaluated on chest computedtomography images. Statistical analysis was performed.RESULTS: Left innominate vein stenosis developed in 1 (1.5%) and 13 (9.2%)patients after implantation with 6.5 and 8F catheters, respectively. Differencein the cumulative incidence of left innominate vein stenosis was statisticallysignificant between the two groups (log rank test p-value: 0.002). In Coxregression analysis, the hazard ratio for left innominate vein stenosis was20.766 ( p = 0.005) for an 8F catheter.CONCLUSION: The incidence of left innominate vein stenosis was higher afterimplantation of totally implantable venous access ports with 8F catheter ratherthan with 6.5F catheter. Considering that using 8F catheter versus 6.5F catheter has no advantage in terms of performance of the device, the results of our study suggest that ports with catheters >7F should be avoided.DOI: 10.1177/1129729818765062 PMID: 29560786
