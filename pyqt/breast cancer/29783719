Estrogen-like activity was studied using the wellcharacterized E-screen assay in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells. The mechanism underlying the breast cancer inhibitory activity of the compounds wasstudied using human ER-negative MDA-MB-231 and ER-positive MCF-7 cells. Theactivation of apoptosis pathway-related proteins was investigated by westernblotting, using extracts of R. undulatum prepared in three solvent conditions(EX1, EX2, and EX3). The R. undulatum chemical constituents (compounds 1⁻3)showed estrogen-like activity in the concentration range of 10 to 50 μM, byincreasing the proliferation of human ER-positive MCF-7 cells. These effects wereattenuated by co-treatment with 100 nM fulvestrant, an ER antagonist. Compounds1⁻3 decreased the viability of MCF-7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.Compounds 1 (aloe emodin) and 2 (rhapontigenin) induced mitochondria-independent apoptosis by activating the caspase-8 pathway, whereas the cytotoxic effect ofcompound 3 (chrysophanol 1-O-β-d-glucopyranoside) was mediated through themitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23051215 PMID: 29783719
