Early moleculartaxonomies of TNBC based heavily on gene expression profiling, which is notreadily available in the clinic today, do not necessarily encompass othermolecular targets already incorporated into rationally designed clinical trials. We state that it is possible to delineate five subgroups of TNBC relevant topresent-day clinical practice and cover the evidence that lends credence toemerging biomarker-directed treatment strategies for each subgroup.DOI: 10.1200/JOP.18.00034 PMID: 29746805
