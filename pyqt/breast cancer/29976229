Stromal fibroblast-derived Sdc1participates in paracrine growth stimulation of breast carcinoma cells andorchestrates stromal extracellular matrix fiber alignment, thereby creating amigration and invasion-permissive microenvironment. Here, we specifically tested the role of stromal Sdc1 in metastasis.METHODS: The metastatic potential of the aggressive mouse mammary carcinoma cell lines, 4T1 and E0776, was tested in wild-type and genetically Sdc1-deficient hostanimals. Metastatic lesions were characterized by immunohistochemical analysis.RESULTS: After orthotopic inoculation, the lung metastatic burden was reduced in Sdc1-/- animals by 97% and more than 99%, in BALB/cJ and C57BL/6 animals,respectively. The difference in metastatic efficiency was maintained when thetumor cells were injected into the tail vein, suggesting that host Sdc1 exertsits effect during later stages of the metastatic cascade. Co-localization studiesidentified Sdc1 expression in stromal fibroblasts within the metastaticmicroenvironment and in normal airway epithelial cells but not in other cells(endothelial cells, α-smooth muscle actin positive cells, leucocytes,macrophages). The Ki67 proliferation index and the rate of apoptosis of themetastatic tumor cells were diminished in Sdc1-/- vs. Sdc1+/+ animals, andleucocyte density was indistinguishable. Sdc1-mediated metastatic efficiency was abolished when the animals were housed at a thermoneutral ambient temperature of 31 °C, suggesting that the host Sdc1 effect on metastasis requires mild coldstress.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, Sdc1 is induced in the lung microenvironment aftermammary carcinoma cell dissemination and promotes outgrowth of metastases in atemperature-dependent manner.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0995-x PMCID: PMC6034333PMID: 29976229
