However, the contributions of histone modifiers to breast cancerprogression are unclear, and how these processes vary between molecular subtypes has yet to be adequately addressed. Here we report that genetic orpharmacological targeting of the epigenetic modifier Ezh2 dramatically hindersmetastatic behaviour in both a mouse model of breast cancer and patient-derivedxenografts reflective of the Luminal B subtype. We further define asubtype-specific molecular mechanism whereby EZH2 maintains H3K27me3-mediatedrepression of the FOXC1 gene, thereby inactivating a FOXC1-driven, anti-invasive transcriptional program. We demonstrate that higher FOXC1 is predictive offavourable outcome specifically in Luminal B breast cancer patients and establishthe use of EZH2 methyltransferase inhibitors as a viable strategy to blockmetastasis in Luminal B breast cancer, where options for targeted therapy arelimited.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04864-8 PMCID: PMC6026192PMID: 29959321
