ZnO nanopolymer, a wetting agent, PEG co-solvent and water/oilemulsion stabilizer were considered in our nanofluid formulation. The resultingnanofluid was characterized by SEM, FTIR, photoluminescence, band gap energy,zeta potential and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The cytotoxic effects on the growth offour cancer cell lines were evaluated by MTT assay. The IC50 (µg/ml) values of30, 41, 40 and 35 for KB44, MCF-7, HT29 and HeLa cells, respectively, after 48 h of nanoformulation treatment suggested the cytotoxic effect of thisnanoformulation on these cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner(p < .05). ZnO nanofluid destroyed cancer cell lines more efficiently than thenormal HFF-2 (IC50 = 105 µg/ml). The reduction in cell viability in response toZnO nanofluid treatment induced apoptosis in the cultured cells. Skinsensitization test plus antibacterial activity were also measured. Side effecttests on 70 white mice in vivo resulted in only 3-4 abnormal situations inhepatic tissue section possibly due to the idiosyncratic drug reactions.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1452023 PMID: 29565204
