Lack of data from large prospectivestudies on geriatric breast cancer patients often makes it difficult forclinicians to make treatments decisions for them. Because both benefit and riskof treatment should be taken into account, treatment is usually determinedconsidering life expectancy or comorbidities in elderly patients. Treatment ofbreast cancer is differentiated according to histologic classifications, andhormone therapy is even adopted for patients with metastatic breast cancer iftumor tissue expresses hormone receptors. Endocrine therapy can offer greatbenefit to elderly patients considering its equivalent efficacy to chemotherapywith fewer toxicities if it is appropriately used. Aromatase inhibitors areusually prescribed agents in hormone therapy for elderly breast cancer patientsdue to their physiology after menopause. Here, endocrine therapy for elderlypatients with breast cancer in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and palliative setting isreviewed along with predictive adverse events resulting from the use of hormoneagents.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6074808 PMCID: PMC5822785PMID: 29581979
