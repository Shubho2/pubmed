ER+ tumors have a worse response tochemotherapy compared to ER- tumors. BCL-2, TP53, BAX and NF-ΚB are involved indrug resistance in the ER+ tumors. Recently it was shown that Cancer Stem Cells(CSCs) play an important role in drug resistance. In this study we tested thehypothesis that CSCs of the ER+ tumors resist drug through the overexpression of BCL-2, TP53, BAX and NF-ΚB.METHODS: CSCs were isolated by anoikis resistance assay from MCF7 (ER+) andMDA-MB-231 (ER-) cell lines. Isolated CSCs were treated with doxorubicin (DOX)and the mRNA expression levels of BCL-2, TP53, BAX and NFKB were investigated by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) with and without treatment.RESULTS: BCL-2, BAX and NF-ΚB showed decreased expression in MCF7 bulk cancercells after DOX treatment whereas only BCL-2 and BAX showed decreased expression in MDA-MB-231 bulk cancer cells. Interestingly TP53 was the only gene showed aconsiderable increase in its expression in CSCs of the ER+ MCF7 cell linecompared to bulk cancer cells. Moreover, TP53 was the only gene showingexceptionally higher level of expression in MCF7-CSCs compared toMDA-MB-231-CSCs.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CSCs in the ER+ cells escape the effect ofDOX treatment by the elevation of p53 expression.Copyright © 2018 National Cancer Institute, Cairo University.
