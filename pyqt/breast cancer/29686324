Survival of 936 patients with or without isolated tumour cells (ITC) in their SNs were compared with the log-rank test and Coxregression analysis.RESULTS: Eight hundred sixty one (92.0%) patients were ITC-negative (pN0i-) and75 (8.0%) ITC-positive (pN0i+). Patients with ITC-positive cancer received morefrequently adjuvant systemic therapies than those with ITC-negative cancer. Themedian follow-up time was 9.5 years. Ten-year distant disease-free survival was95.3% in the pN0i- group and 88.8% in the pN0i+ group (P = 0.013). ITCs were anindependent prognostic factor in a Cox regression model (HR = 2.34, 95% CI1.09-5.04; P = 0.029), together with tumour Ki-67 proliferation index anddiameter. ITCs were associated with unfavourable overall survival (P = 0.005) andbreast cancer-specific survival (P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that presence of ITCs in the SNs is an adverseprognostic factor in early small node-negative breast cancer, and may beconsidered in the decision-making for adjuvant therapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0052-7 PMID: 29686324
