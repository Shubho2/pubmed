In this way DDT minimizes replication stress inflicted by a wide range ofendogenous and exogenous agents, and provides a critical first line defenseagainst alkylating and platinating chemotherapeutics. Effective DDT stronglydepends on damage-induced, site-specific PCNA-ubiquitination at Lysine (K) 164 bythe E2/E3 complex (RAD6/18). A survey of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed a high frequency of tumors presents RAD6/RAD18 bi-allelic inactivating deletions.For instance, 11% of renal cell carcinoma and 5% of pancreatic tumors haveinactivating RAD18-deletions and 7% of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumorslack RAD6B. To determine the potential benefit for tumor-specific DDT defects, wefollowed a genetic approach by establishing unique sets of DDT-proficientPcnaK164 and -defective PcnaK164R lymphoma and breast cancer cell lines. In theabsence of exogenous DNA damage, PcnaK164R tumors grew comparably to theirPcnaK164 controls in vitro and in vivo. However, DDT-defective lymphomas andbreast cancers were compared to their DDT-proficient controls hypersensitive tothe chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin (CsPt), both in vitro and in vivo. CsPtstrongly inhibited tumor growth and the overall survival of tumor bearing micegreatly improved in the DDT-defective condition. These insights open newtherapeutic possibilities for precision cancer medicine with DNA damagingchemotherapeutics and optimize Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS)-basedcancer-diagnostics, -therapeutics, and -prognosis.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24777 PMCID: PMC5922359PMID: 29721165
