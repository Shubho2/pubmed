A five-point questionnaire wasprepared and sent to 300 oncologists through a web-based survey engine. This was done in preparation for my lecture on "Ongoing Research and Potential ResearchAvenues" in IBSCON held in Chennai in August 2016. SPSS software was used for thestatistical analysis. Of a total of 300 emails that were sent out for the survey,120 replies were received, which is 40%. Among the results of various questions, (i) 65% of the oncologists felt that there were >â€‰300 ongoing studies inbrachytherapy and out of them only 10-20 were on head and neck brachytherapy;(ii) 58% of the responders felt that external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) advancesfollowed by lack of training and experience are the reasons for declining role ofbrachytherapy; (iii) among the responders, numbers of head and neck brachytherapyperformed stand third after gynecological and breast brachytherapy. This surveyshows that brachytherapy in head and neck cancers is an essential tool, butseldom practiced. If no path-breaking event happens, we may be dealing with it asa dying art.DOI: 10.1007/s13193-018-0735-9 PMCID: PMC5984854 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29887696
