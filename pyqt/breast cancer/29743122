Alterations ofdrug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters are major determinants ofchemoresistance in tumor cells. However, whether the metabolizing enzymes andtransporters are under the control of SPIN1 in breast cancer chemoresistance has not yet been defined.METHODS: SPIN1 expression in breast cancer cells and tissues was detected byquantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Chemosensitivityassays in vitro and in vivo were performed to determine the effect of SPIN1 onAdriamycin resistance. Downstream effectors of SPIN1 were screened by microarray and confirmed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Luciferase assay and Western blot wereused to identify miRNAs regulating SPIN1.RESULTS: We showed that SPIN1 was significantly elevated in drug-resistant breastcancer cell lines and tissues, compared with the chemosensitive ones. SPIN1enhanced Adriamycin resistance of breast cancer cells in vitro, anddownregulation of SPIN1 by miRNA could decrease Adriamycin resistance in vivo.Mechanistically, drug metabolizing enzymes and transporter CYP2C8, UGT2B4,UGT2B17Â and ABCB4 were proven to be downstream effectors of SPIN1. Notably, SPIN1was identified as a direct target of the miR-148/152 family (miR-148a-3p,miR-148b-3p and miR-152-3p). As expected, miR-148a-3p, miR-148b-3p or miR-152-3p could increase Adriamycin sensitivity in breast cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, high expression of SPIN1 or low expression of the miR-148/152 family predictedpoorer survival in breast cancer patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our results establish that SPIN1, negatively regulated by themiR-148/152 family, enhances Adriamycin resistance in breast cancer viaupregulating the expression of drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporter.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0748-9 PMCID: PMC5944004PMID: 29743122
