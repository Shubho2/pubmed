[Epub ahead of print]Evaluation of recurrence patterns and survival in modern series of young womenwith breast cancer.Larson KE(1), Grobmyer SR(1), Valente SA(1).Author information: (1)Division of Breast Services, Department of General Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.The data on oncologic outcomes in young women with breast cancer (BC) are datedas it relates to recurrences and mortality. Our goal was to assess these outcomesin a modern series of young women with BC. A retrospective chart reviewidentified women ≤40 years old with stage I-III BC diagnosed from 2006 to 2013 atour institution. Demographics, tumor biology, type of operation, recurrence, and survival were analyzed. Overall, 322 women were identified. Most had ER+(70%)infiltrating ductal tumors (88%) with low stage (42% T1; 41% T2; 56% N0).Follow-up was 4.2 years with 5.6% local-regional recurrence (LRR), 15.2%metastatic recurrence (MR), and 8% mortality. There was no survival differencebased on demographics, tumor biology, or type of operation. T3 tumors (P < .001) and node positivity (P < .001) were associated with worse disease-free survival. In this modern series of young women with BC, stage rather than tumor biology or surgical choice has more effect on recurrence-free survival. MR was more commonthan LRR, with most MR occurring within the first 2 years after surgery.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13041 PMID: 29687541
