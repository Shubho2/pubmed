However, implantable ports also increase the risk of deep veinthrombosis and related complications in this high-risk population. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis(UEDVT) in patients with breast cancer to determine whether the risk of UEDVT washigher with chest versus arm ports, as well as to determine the importance ofpreviously reported risk factors predisposing to UEDVT in the setting of activecancer. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 297 women with breast cancer who had ports placed in our institution between the dates of December 1,2010, and December 31, 2016. The primary outcome was the development ofradiologically confirmed UEDVT ipsilateral to the implanted port. Overall, 17 of 297 study subjects (5.7%) were found to have UEDVT. There was 1 documented caseof associated pulmonary embolism. Fourteen (9.5%) of 147 subjects with arm ports experienced UEDVT compared with only 3 (2.0%) of 150 subjects with chest ports (P= .0056). Thus, implantation of arm ports as opposed to chest ports may beassociated with a higher rate of UEDVT in patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.1177/1178223418771909 PMCID: PMC5987887PMID: 29881287
