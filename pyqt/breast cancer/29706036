Therefore, it requires a perturbation of physiologicalsignals, such as blood flow and oxygenation. In that sense, a few groups reportedthat monitoring a relative hemodynamic change during a breast tissue compression or a breath-hold to a patient can provide good contrast between tumor andnontumor. However, no longitudinal study reports the utilization of a breath-holdto predict tumor response during chemotherapy. A continuous wave near-infraredspectroscopy was employed to monitor hemodynamics in rat breast tumor during ahyperoxic to normoxic inhalational gas intervention to mimic a breath-hold duringtumor growth and chemotherapy. The reduced oxyhemoglobin concentration duringinhalational gas intervention correlated well with tumor growth, and it respondedone day earlier than the change of tumor volume after chemotherapy. Inconclusion, monitoring tumor hemodynamics during a breath-hold may serve as abiomarker to predict chemotherapeutic efficacy of tumor.(2018) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).DOI: 10.1117/1.JBO.23.4.048001 PMID: 29706036
