In thisstudy, we used the Arraystar Human circRNA Array to construct a genome-widecircRNA profile of esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) and breast cancer (BC).Patients and methods: Expression levels between cancer lesions and adjacentnormal-appearing tissues were compared. We observed 469 upregulated circRNAs and 275 downregulated circRNAs in ESCC. Hsa_circRNA_103670 was upregulated 20.3-fold,while hsa_circRNA_030162 was downregulated 12.1-fold. For BC, 715 circRNAs wereupregulated, and 440 circRNAs were downregulated. Hsa_circRNA_005230 wasupregulated 12.2-fold, while hsa_circRNA_406225 was downregulated 12.4-fold.Results: When we set the criteria as fold change in expression â‰¥2 between cancer and adjacent normal-appearing tissue with a P-value <0.01, there were 22 commoncircRNAs (11 upregulated and 11 downregulated) in relation to both ESCC and BC.Gene ontology and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analyses showedthat these circRNAs were involved in the tumorigenesis of human cancers.Conclusion: Our study revealed that circRNAs are promising candidates as valuablebiomarkers for ESCC and BC, although relevant research is still in its infancyand the functional role of specific circRNAs in tumorigenesis is just starting tobe elucidated.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S167863 PMCID: PMC6061203PMID: 30087579
