Epub 2018 May 11.The Critical, Clinical Role of Interferon-Beta in Regulating Cancer Stem CellProperties in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.Doherty MR(1), Jackson MW(1)(2).Author information: (1)1 Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.(2)2 Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Case Western ReserveUniversity , Cleveland, Ohio.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) the deadliest form of this disease currentlylacks a targeted therapy and is characterized by increased risk of metastasis andpresence of therapeutically resistant cancer stem cells (CSC). Recent evidencehas demonstrated that the presence of an interferon (IFN)/signal transducer ofactivated transcription 1 (STAT1) gene signature correlates with improvedtherapeutic response and overall survival in TNBC patients. In agreement withthese clinical observations, our recent work has demonstrated, in a cell model ofTNBC that CSC have intrinsically repressed IFN signaling. Administration of IFN-βrepresses CSC properties, inducing a less aggressive non-CSC state. Moreover, an elevated IFN-β gene signature correlated with repressed CSC-related genes and an increased presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in TNBC specimens. Wetherefore propose that IFN-β be considered as a potential therapeutic option inthe treatment of TNBC, to repress the CSC properties responsible for therapyfailure. Future studies aim to improve methods to target delivery of IFN-β totumors, to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects.DOI: 10.1089/dna.2018.4247 PMCID: PMC5985904PMID: 29750542  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
