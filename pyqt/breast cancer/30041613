The protein has been identified as a component of the LittleElongation Complex, involved in transcription of small nuclear RNAs. ZC3H8 isoverexpressed in a number of human and mouse breast cancer cell lines, andelevated mRNA levels are associated with a poorer prognosis for women with breastcancer.METHODS: We used RNA silencing to decrease levels of expression in mouse mammary tumor cells and overexpression of ZC3H8 in cells derived from the normal mousemammary gland. We measured characteristics of cell behavior in vitro, includingproliferation, migration, invasion, growth in soft agar, and spheroid growth. We assessed the ability of these cells to form tumors in syngeneic BALB/c mice.ZC3H8 protein was visualized in cells using confocal microscopy.RESULTS: Tumor cells with lower ZC3H8 expression exhibited decreasedproliferation rates, slower migration, reduced ability to invade through abasement membrane, and decreased anchorage independent growth in vitro. Cellswith lower ZC3H8 levels formed fewer and smaller tumors in animals.Overexpression of ZC3H8 in non-tumorigenic COMMA-D cells led to an oppositeeffect. ZC3H8 protein localized to both PML bodies and Cajal bodies within thenucleus. ZC3H8 has a casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation site near theN-terminus, and a CK2 inhibitor caused the numerous PML bodies and ZC3H8 tocoalesce to a few larger bodies. Removal of the inhibitor restored PML bodies to their original state. A mutant ZC3H8 lacking the predicted CK2 phosphorylationsite showed localization and numbers of ZC3H8/PML bodies similar to wild type. Incontrast, a mutant constructed with a glutamic acid in place of thephosphorylatable threonine showed dramatically increased numbers of smallernuclear foci.CONCLUSIONS: These experiments demonstrate that Zc3h8 expression contributes toaggressive tumor cell behavior in vitro and in vivo. Our studies show that ZC3H8 integrity is key to maintenance of PML bodies. The work provides a link betweenthe Little Elongation Complex, PML bodies, and the cancer cell phenotype.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4674-1 PMCID: PMC6057032PMID: 30041613
