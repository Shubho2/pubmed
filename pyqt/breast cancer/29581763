Our study aimed to evaluate survival andoutcomes of cancer patients from a HBCR in eastern China. Methods: Active andpassive follow-up methods were used to obtain information on survival status for all patients from Qidong City and Haimen City in the databases of ourhospital-based registrations from 2002 to 2014. Censor time for survival was 31stMarch, 2016. Survival probability was estimated using the life-table method with SPSS Statistics software, and comparison of significant differences in survivalrates was tested by Wilcoxon (Gehan) statistic. Results: The outcomes of 5010patients were identified in the follow-up for 5244 cases from Qidong and Haimen, with a follow-up rate of 95.65%, and a rate of lost to follow-up of 4.35%. The1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year observed survival (OS) rate in all-combined cancer sites were 59.80%, 37.70%, 30.82%, and 22.60%, respectively. The top 10 cancer sites inrank were cancers of lung, esophagus, liver, cervix, stomach, breast,colon-rectum, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharynx, and ovary, with 5-year OSrates of 12.63%, 19.62%, 11.69%, 66.61%, 21.35%, 59.43%, 36.36%, 37.03%, 48.95%and 36.17%, respectively. Females experienced better survival than males forlung, esophageal, liver, nasopharyngeal and pancreatic cancers (P<0.05), but not for other sites (P>0.05). A significant difference was also found between malesand females when all-sites were combined (P<0.01). There are significantdifferences (P<0.05) between the 2015 patients (from Qidong) and the 3001patients (from Haimen) with 5-year OS rates of 32.72% vs 29.57%; no significantdifferences were found for 5-year OS rates for individual cancer sites (P>0.05)except for liver (P=0.0005) and ovary (P=0.0460) between the two cities. Younger patients had better prognosis, but significance was only seen in cervical(P=0.0102) and nasopharyngeal (P=0.0305) cancers. Conclusion: The survival rates of each site or of all sites-combined in this setting are consistent with thoseelsewhere in China and abroad. Discrepancies in overall survival could beaffected by the proportion of sites with or without better prognosis.Hospital-based cancer survival is a better index to evaluate outcomes thatreflect the levels of comprehensive treatment and improvement of medical andhealth services.DOI: 10.7150/jca.23039 PMCID: PMC5868149PMID: 29581763
