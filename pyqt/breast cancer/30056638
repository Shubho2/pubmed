[Epub ahead of print]Screening women with a personal history of breast cancer: overview of theevidence on breast imaging surveillance.Houssami N(1), Cho N(2).Author information: (1)Sydney School of Public Health, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney,Sydney, Australia.(2)Department of Radiology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.This work reviews the evidence on breast imaging for screening (surveillance) in women with a history of breast cancer (BC). Early detection of second BCs inthese women improves their prognosis based on studies using mammography (usually with clinical examinations) for surveillance. Cohort studies have estimated that mammography surveillance has moderate sensitivity (65.4%) and good specificity(98.3%), and have shown that these women are at a higher risk of interval BC thanage- and breast density-matched women without a history of BC. Studies of adjunctimaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging) for surveillance that havereported detection and accuracy measures have generally shown that adjunctimaging detected more second BCs than mammography and added substantially to the amount of false-positive results; however, little evidence exists regardingscreening efficacy of adjunct imaging as part of routine surveillance.DOI: 10.14366/usg.18017 PMID: 30056638
