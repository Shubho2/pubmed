Propensity score matching was conducted to avoid potential confoundingfactors with ratio at 1:1. We used Kaplan-Meier to compare OS and RCSS betweenthe married patients and the unmarried, respectively. We used cox proportionhazard regressions to obtain hazard rates for OS, and proportionalsubdistribution hazard model was performed to calculate hazard rates forRCSS.Totally, 5196 patients were included. The married (2598 [50%]) aged patientshad better crude 5-year overall survival rate (64.2% vs 57.3%, P < .001) andhigher crude 5-year cancer-specific survival rate (80% vs 75.9%, P < .001) thanthe unmarried (2598 (50%)), respectively. In multivariate analyses, marriedpatients had significantly lower overall death than unmarried patients(HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.71-0.83, P < .001), while aged married patients had nocancer-specific survival benefit versus the unmarried aged patients (HR = 0.92,95% CI = 0.81-1.04, P = .17).Among old population, married patients with earlystage RC had better OS than the unmarried, while current evidence showed thatmarital status might have no protective effect on cancer-specific survival.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010637 PMID: 29718875  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
