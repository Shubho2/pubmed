Currently, nobiomarker that identifies patients for early versus late recurrence, or one that selects patients or tumors for longer versus shorter durations of endocrinetherapy (ET) is available and a crucial question is how to properly selectpatients who could be spared extended ET or those who require it. In the last 20 years more than 40,000 women were enrolled in randomized trials to answer thequestion of optimal duration of ET. According to the results of these studiesextended adjuvant ET is more effective than standard 5 years of adjuvant ET.Extended ET in patients who remain premenopausal after 5 years of adjuvanttamoxifen is still tamoxifen for another 5 years. Extended ET with aromataseinhibitors (AIs) should be offered to postmenopausal women with substantialresidual risk of relapse after completing 5 years of tamoxifen therapy. Extensionof AI treatment to 10 years resulted in significantly better 5-year disease-free survival including disease recurrence local/distant or the occurrence ofcontralateral breast cancer events. Currently, new therapeutic targets are under investigation, but the beneficial effect of prolonged treatment for high-riskpatients, identified by using multigenomic tests, remains unclear. Thus, further studies need to be performed to confirm the advantage of extended adjuvant ET in selected patients.DOI: 10.1177/1758835918777437 PMCID: PMC6024281PMID: 29977350
