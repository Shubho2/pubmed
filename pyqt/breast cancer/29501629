However, theirclinical application has been limited due to their low solubility andbioavailability. Nevertheless, independent studies have considered thesecompounds as interesting prototypes for developing new chemical structures usefulfor anticancer therapy. Here in, we report the synthesis of novel curcumin-likehydrazide analogues (3a and 3b), and a series of curcumin-resveratrol hybridcompounds (4a-f), and the evaluation of their cytotoxic potential on three tumor cell lines MCF-7 (breast), A549 (lung), and HepG2 (liver). Cell viability wassignificantly reduced in all tested cell lines when compounds 4c-4e were used.The IC50 values for these compounds on MCF-7 cells were lower than those forcurcumin, resveratrol, or curcumin combined with resveratrol. We evidenced that4c promoted a drastic increase of G2/M population. The accumulation of cells inmitosis onset in treated cultures was due to, at least in part, the ability of 4cto modulate nuclear kinase proteins, which orchestrate important events inmitosis progression. We have also observed significant reduction of the relative RNAm abundance of CCNB1, PLK1, AURKA, AURKB in samples treated with 4c, withconcomitant increase of CDKN1A (p21). Thus, compound 4c is a promisingmulti-target antitumor agent that should be considered for further in vivostudies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
