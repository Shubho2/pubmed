Although TNBC lacksexpression of ERα, the expression of ERβ and its variants are detected quitefrequently in this cancer type and can represent an avenue for treatment. We showthat two of the variants of ERβ, namely ERβ2 and ERβ5, control aggressiveness of TNBC by regulating hypoxic signaling through stabilization of HIF-1α. RNA-seq of patient derived xenografts (PDX) from TNBC shows expression of ERβ2, ERβ4 andERβ5 variants in more than half of the samples. Furthermore, expression of ERβ4in the immortalized, normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A that isresistant to tumorsphere formation caused transformation and development oftumorspheres. By contrast, ERβ1, ERβ2 or ERβ5 were unable to support tumorsphere formation. We have previously shown that all variants except ERβ1 stabilizeHIF-1α but only ERβ4 appears to have the ability to transform normal mammaryepithelial cells, pointing towards a unique property of ERβ4. We propose that ERβvariants may be good diagnostic tools and also serve as novel targets fortreatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24134 PMCID: PMC5844739PMID: 29552303
