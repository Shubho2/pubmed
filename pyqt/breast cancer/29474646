Serum levels of TS and SHBG and patient's BMI wereevaluated before surgery. The contribution of TS, SHBG, their ratio (TS/SHBG) andBMI to the predictive capability of tumor-specific biomarkers was investigated byHarrell's c statistic.Results: TS alone did not affect prognosis, whereas SHBG was protective inpostmenopausal patients, in which BMI was associated with a progressive increase in the relapse-specific hazard ratio (HR). When in combination, TS, SHBG and BMI,affected prognosis in different ways depending on menopausal status. The bestpredictive capability (c = 0.78) was observed in postmenopausal patients when at the basic model (N + TLI) were added TS, BMI, TS * BMI interaction, with orwithout SHBG. In premenopause subgroup, the best predictive capability (c = 0.67)was provided by the basic model (N + TLI) plus TS and SHBG or their ratio, BMIand TS * BMI or TS/SHBG * BMI interaction.Conclusions: Patient-associated features such as BMI and serum levels of TS andSHBG can improve the predictive capability of consolidate tumor-specificbiomarkers in both pre- and postmenopause, thus providing a relevant contributionto the decision-making process.DOI: 10.1093/jjco/hyy012 PMID: 29474646  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
