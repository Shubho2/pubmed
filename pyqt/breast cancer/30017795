The present study explored the association between G-CSF and changes in cancerantigen (CA)27.29 and circulating tumor cell (CTC) levels during therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 3754 node-positive or high-risk node-negativeearly-stage breast cancer patients were treated within the SUCCESS-A trial(simultaneous study of gemcitabine-docetaxel combination adjuvant treatment, aswell as extended bisphosphonate and surveillance-trial). CA27.29 and CTCs weredetermined before the start and within 6 weeks after the end of chemotherapy.RESULTS: Overall, 1324 of the 2646 patients (50.0%) available for analysis had ≥ 1 G-CSF applications during chemotherapy. G-CSF application was significantlyassociated with CA27.29 status before and after chemotherapy (χ2 = 30.6, df = 3; P < .001), because 238 patients (18.0%) with G-CSF treatment but only 146 (11.0%)without G-CSF treatment switched from a negative CA27.29 status before to apositive CA27.29 status after chemotherapy. In addition, patients with G-CSFapplication showed a significantly greater increase in CA27.29 levels afterchemotherapy compared with patients without any G-CSF application duringchemotherapy (Mann-Whitney U test; Z = -7.81, P < .001). No significantassociation was found between G-CSF application and CTC status before or afterchemotherapy (χ2 = 1.2, df = 3; P = .75).CONCLUSION: Cautious interpretation is needed regarding elevated levels ofMUC-1-derived tumor markers such as CA27.29 shortly after adjuvant chemotherapywhen G-CSF has been given, because G-CSF treatment was associated with increased CA27.29 levels after chemotherapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
