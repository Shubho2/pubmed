Mammographic screening aims toreduce mortality from breast cancer through early detection in asymptomaticwomen. Purpose To compare mammographic screening attendance among immigrant andminority women to that of other women. Material and Methods A literature searchof PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane identified 1369 papers published between January 1995 and March 2016. In the review, we included 33 studiesinvestigating mammographic screening attendance among immigrant and/or minoritywomen. In a meta-analysis, we included 19 of the studies that compared attendanceamong immigrant and/or minority women with that among other women, using a randomeffects model. Results The review included studies from Europe, North America,and Oceania, with 42,666,093 observations of opportunities for mammographicscreening. Attendance was generally lower among immigrant and minority womencompared to other women (46.2% vs. 55.0%; odds ratio = 0.64, 95% confidenceinterval = 0.56-0.73; P < 0.05, I2 = 99.9%). Non-Western immigrants had lowerattendance rates than other immigrants. Conclusion Immigrant and minority womenhad lower mammographic screening attendance than other women, which couldpotentially put them at increased risk for more advanced breast cancer. Thisreview emphasizes the importance of continued efforts to engage with thepreventative health needs of diverse populations in attempts to achieve equality in access to, and use of, care.DOI: 10.1177/0284185118758132 PMID: 29451023
