Previous meta-analyses demonstrate increased risks ofcomplications, but these studies largely represent one product. The purpose ofthis study is to stratify outcomes on the basis of a meta-analysis ofcomplications incorporating all new studies after 2012 and their associated newhuman-based products.METHODS: A query of the MEDLINE database for articles on HADM and breastreconstruction from January 2012 to October 2015 yielded 172 citations. Twolevels of screening identified 47 relevant studies. Thirteen studies were used incomparative meta-analysis.RESULTS: Complication rates were higher in HADM patients: total complications,17.7% versus 6.1%; seroma, 8.3% versus 5.4%; infection, 7.2% versus 5.9%; andflap necrosis, 14.7% versus 7.1%. Meta-analysis revealed a statisticallysignificant increased risk of total complications in patients who underwentreconstruction with HADM when compared with their submuscular reconstructioncohort (p = 0.03; relative risk (RR) = 1.46; confidence interval (CI):1.04-2.04). Patients who underwent reconstruction with HADM demonstrated asignificantly increased risk of flap necrosis (p < 0.01; RR = 2.39; CI: 1.8-3.16)and infection (p = 0.02; RR = 1.5; CI: 1.07-2.09) when compared with those whounderwent submuscular reconstruction. There was no significant difference inseroma, hematoma, or implant explantation between these two groups.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an increased risk of overall complications,specifically infection and flap necrosis, in patients who underwent tissueexpander/implant breast reconstruction with HADM when compared with those whounderwent submuscular placement. This must be weighed against the advantages inenhancing aesthetic outcomes, increasing intraoperative fill volume, andameliorating capsular contracture.Copyright © 2018 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and AestheticSurgeons.
