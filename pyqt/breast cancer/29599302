Primary tumor cells appear todetach from the parent tumor site, migrate, survive and pass through the bloodbrain barrier in order to establish cerebral metastases. This complex processinvolves distinct molecular and genetic mechanisms that mediate metastasis fromthese primary organs to the brain. Furthermore, an interaction between theinvading cells and cerebral milieu is shown to promote this process as well.Here, we review the mechanisms by which primary cancer cells metastasize to thebrain via a mechanism called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as well as theinvolvement of certain microRNA and genetic aberrations implicated in cerebralmetastases from the lung, breast, skin, kidney and colon. While the mechanismsgoverning the development of brain metastases remain a major hindrance intreatment, understanding and identification of the aforementioned molecularpathways may allow for improved management and discovery of novel therapeutictargets.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12424 PMID: 29599302  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
