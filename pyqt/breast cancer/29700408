Jonine.figueroa@ed.ac.uk.E-cadherin (CDH1) is a putative tumor suppressor gene implicated in breastcarcinogenesis. Yet, whether risk factors or survival differ by E-cadherin tumor expression is unclear. We evaluated E-cadherin tumor immunohistochemistryexpression using tissue microarrays of 5,933 female invasive breast cancers from 12 studies from the Breast Cancer Consortium. H-scores were calculated andcase-case odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimatedusing logistic regression. Survival analyses were performed using Cox regression models. All analyses were stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) status andhistologic subtype. E-cadherin low cases (N = 1191, 20%) were more frequently of lobular histology, low grade, >2 cm, and HER2-negative. Loss of E-cadherinexpression (score < 100) was associated with menopausal hormone use amongER-positive tumors (ever compared to never users, OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.97-1.59),which was stronger when we evaluated complete loss of E-cadherin (i.e.H-score = 0), OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.06-2.33. Breast cancer specific mortality wasunrelated to E-cadherin expression in multivariable models. E-cadherin lowexpression is associated with lobular histology, tumor characteristics andmenopausal hormone use, with no evidence of an association with breast cancerspecific survival. These data support loss of E-cadherin expression as animportant marker of tumor subtypes.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-23733-4 PMCID: PMC5920115PMID: 29700408
