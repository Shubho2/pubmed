Lymphatics undergo changes that facilitate metastasis as aresult of activation of the cells lining lymphatic vessels, lymphatic endothelialcells (LECs). Inhibition of activation by targeting VEGFR3 can reduce invasiontoward lymphatics. To best benefit patients, this approach should be coupled withstandard of care that slows tumor growth, such as chemotherapy. Little is knownabout how chemotherapies, like docetaxel, may influence lymphatics andconversely, how lymphatics can alter responses to therapy.METHODS: A novel 3D in vitro co-culture model of the human breast tumormicroenvironment was employed to examine the contribution of LECs to tumorinvasion and viability with docetaxel and anti-VEGFR3, using three cell lines,MDA-MB-231, HCC38, and HCC1806. In vivo, the 4T1 mouse model of breast carcinoma was used to examine the efficacy of combinatorial therapy with docetaxel andanti-VEGFR3 on lymph node metastasis and tumor growth. Lymphangiogenesis in thesemice was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Luminex analysiswas used to measure expression of lymphangiogenic cytokines.RESULTS: In vitro, tumor cell invasion significantly increased with docetaxelwhen LECs were present; this effect was attenuated by inhibition of VEGFR3. LECs reduced docetaxel-induced cell death independent of VEGFR3. In vivo, docetaxelsignificantly increased breast cancer metastasis to the lymph node. Docetaxel andanti-VEGFR3 combination therapy reduced lymph node and lung metastasis in 4T1 andsynergized to reduce tumor growth. Docetaxel induced VEGFR3-dependent vesselenlargement, lymphangiogenesis, and expansion of the LEC population in theperitumoral microenvironment, but not tumor-free stroma. Docetaxel caused anupregulation in pro-lymphangiogenic factors including VEGFC and TNF-Î± in thetumor microenvironment in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: Here we present a counter-therapeutic effect of docetaxelchemotherapy that triggers cancer cells to elicit lymphangiogenesis. In turn,lymphatics reduce cancer response to docetaxel by altering the cytokine milieu inbreast cancer. These changes lead to an increase in tumor cell invasion andsurvival under docetaxel treatment, ultimately reducing docetaxel efficacy. Thesedocetaxel-induced effects can be mitigated by anti-VEGFR3 therapy, resulting in asynergism between these treatments that reduces tumor growth and metastasis.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4619-8 PMCID: PMC6034223PMID: 29976154
