Electronic address: yshukla@iitr.res.in.Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies among women worldwide, which is indeed associated with metabolic reprogramming. However, BC is a verycomplex and heterogeneous disease, which can relate with the changes in metabolicprofiles during BC progression. Hence, investigating the metabolic alterationsduring BC stage progression may reveal the deregulated pathways and usefulmetabolic signatures of BC. To demonstrate the metabolic insights, we opted 1HNMR spectroscopy based metabolomics of blood plasma of early and late stage BC(N = 72) with age and gender matched healthy subjects (N = 50). Further, themetabolic profiles were analyzed to delineate the potential signatures of BC byperforming multivariate and nonparametric statistical analysis in early and late stages of BC in comparison with healthy subjects. Sixteen metabolites levels weredifferentially changed (p < 0.05) in the early and late stages of BC from healthysubjects. Among them, the levels of hydroxybutyrate, lysine, glutamate, glucose, N-acetyl glycoprotein, Lactate were highly distinguished in BC stages and showed a good biomarker potential using receiver-operating curves based diagnosticmodels. Furthermore, the significant modulation and good diagnostic performances of glutamate, N-acetyl glycoprotein and Lactate in LBC as compared to EBC givetheir significance in the BC progression. In general, our observationsdemonstrate that these panels of metabolites may act as vital component of themetabolism of early to late stage BC progression. Our results also open newavenue towards early and late stage BC diagnosis and intervention implyingmetabolomics approaches.Copyright © 2018.
