The main purpose ofthis study was to maximize the PE chemotherapeutic efficacy by loading it in anoptimized solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) formula.Materials and methods: The influence of independent variables, which were lipidconcentration (X1), surfactant concentration (X2) and cosurfactant concentration (X3), on dependent ones, which were particle size (Y1), polydispersity index(Y2), zeta potential (Y3), entrapment efficiency (Y4) and cumulative % drugrelease (Y5), were studied and optimized using the Box-Behnken design. Fifteenformulations of PE-SLNs were prepared using hot homogenization followed byultra-sonication technique. Response surface plots, Pareto charts andmathematical equations were produced to study the impact of independent variableson the dependent quality parameters. The anti-proliferative activity of theoptimized formula was then evaluated in three different cancer cell lines,namely, MCF-7, PC-3 and HepG-2, in addition to one normal cell line, HFB-4.Results: The results demonstrated that the particle sizes ranged from 407.5 to651.9 nm and the entrapment efficiencies ranged from 56.02 to 65.23%.Interestingly, the 50% inhibitory concentration of the optimized formula had morethan a 40-fold improved effect on the cell growth inhibition in comparison withits free counterpart. Furthermore, it was more selective against cancer cellsthan normal cells particularly in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.Conclusion: These data proved that nanoencapsulation of PE enhanced itsanticancer efficacy. Therefore, our results suggested that a PE-loaded SLNsoptimized-formula could be a promising chemo therapeutic agent.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S154033 PMCID: PMC5846752PMID: 29563789  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
