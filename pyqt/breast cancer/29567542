Acquisition of multi-drugresistance (MDR) during the treatment of breast cancer is still considered amajor clinical obstacle. Despite the biological functions of miRNAs becomingincreasingly apparent, the function of miRNAs in regulating drug resistance ofbreast cancer remains under investigation. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)was used to quantify the expression of miR-132/-212 (miR-132 and miR-212) indoxorubicin (DOX)-resistant and -sensitive breast cancer tumors and cells. Thefunction of miR-132/-212 in drug resistance was investigated in vitro (MTT assay,TUNEL assay, fluorescence, immunohistochemistry, luciferase reporter assay,Western blotting). We found that miR-132/-212 were commonly overexpressed inDOX-resistant breast cancer tumors and cells. Silenced miR-132/-212 expressioninduced DOX accumulation in MCF-7/ADR cells, while overexpression of miR-132/-212led to breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)-based DOX efflux in MCF-7 cells.Further study showed that up-regulation of miR-132/-212 in MCF-7/ADR cellssuppressed the expression of PTEN, a target gene of miR-132/-212, which activatedAKT phosphorylation and the NF-κB pathway and led to increased BCRP expression.Down-regulation of miR-132/-212 sensitized MCF-7/ADR cells to DOX. Mechanisticinvestigations suggested that miR-132/-212 enhancement was a result ofNF-κB-mediated transactivation of the pri-miR-132/-212 gene. Taken together, our findings are among the first to demonstrate a novel aspect of themiR-132/-212-PTEN-AKT/NF-κB-BCRP pathway in the generation of breast cancerresistance and provides a potential method to reverse drug resistance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
