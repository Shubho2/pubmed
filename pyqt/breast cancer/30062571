This retrospectivestudy compared two volumetric modalities, perometry and simulated circumferentialtape measurement (anatomic- and interval-based), for BCRL detection.METHODS: Between 2005 and 2017, 287 female patients with unilateral breast cancerwere prospectively screened for BCRL by perometry and the relative volume change (RVC) formula. Circumferential measurement was performed by sampling at fiveanatomic landmark-based points or 4-cm intervals from pairs of perometer armdiameter measurements. Volumetric conversion was by a frustum model. TheBland-Altman method was used to compare segmental volume differences. Confusionmatrix analysis was performed for each circumferential measurement techniqueagainst perometry.RESULTS: Median follow-up was 34.7 months over 4 postoperative visits. There was no difference in total arm volume comparing any of the circumferentialmeasurement techniques to perometry. Landmark-based methods significantlyunderestimated upper arm volume (mean difference - 207 mL [- 336, - 78 mL]) andoverestimated forearm volume (mean difference + 170 mL [+ 105, + 237 mL]).Landmark-based methods had greater sensitivity and specificity compared to 4-cminterval methods for detection of both RVC ≥ 10 and 5-10%. Landmark-based methodswere comparable to perometry for detection of RVC ≥ 10%, but sensitivity was only63.2-66.7% for RVC 5-10%.CONCLUSIONS: This hypothesis-generating study suggested the superiority ofanatomic landmark-based circumferential tape measurement compared tointerval-based methods, while generating questions about the underestimation ofupper arm volume and overestimation of forearm volume of circumferential tapemeasurement compared to perometry.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4902-z PMID: 30062571
