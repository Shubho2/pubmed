Radiotherapy has been applied as one of the most common and potent therapeutic strategies, which is synergistic with surgical excision,chemotherapy and targeted therapy for treating malignant tumors. However, theimpact of ionizing radiation on ER expression and ER-related signaling in cancer tissue, as well as the interaction between endocrine and irradiation therapyremains largely elusive. This review will discuss recent findings on ER andER-related signaling, which are relevant for cancer radiotherapy. In addition, wewill summarize pre-clinical and clinical studies that evaluate the consequencesof anti-estrogen and irradiation therapy in cancer, including emerging studies onhead and neck cancer, which might improve the understanding and development ofnovel therapeutic strategies for estrogen-related cancers.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19030713 PMCID: PMC5877574PMID: 29498642
