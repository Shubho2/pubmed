Previous research has shownthat patients who make the "right" decisions, such as being treated at ahigh-volume academic medical center, for example, have better outcomes. An onlinesurvey was conducted to understand awareness of and barriers to these decisionpoints among patients with multiple myeloma and pancreatic, lung, prostate, andmetastatic breast cancers. Survey respondents were identified by 5 participating foundations (multiple myeloma: n = 86, pancreatic: n = 108, lung: n = 56,prostate: n = 50, metastatic breast: n = 86) and recruited by an e-mail or socialmedia invitation. Descriptive analyses were calculated, and the proportion ofpatients from each of the 5 groups was compared for each response category foreach survey item. Consistent gaps in knowledge and actions were identified acrossall cancers evaluated in terms of finding the right doctors/team at the rightcenter; getting the right diagnostic testing done before beginning treatment;engaging in the right course of treatment, including clinical trials; and insharing data. Improving awareness of and changing behavior around these 4decision points will allow patients to receive better care and contribute to the advancement of precision medicine.DOI: 10.1097/PPO.0000000000000319 PMID: 29794540
