MMP-9 level has been suggested as abiological predictor of prognosis in CRC as well as in other types of cancer suchas breast and cervical cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate thestability over time of MMP-9 in cryopreserved plasma, colorectal tumor tissueextract and macroscopically tumor-free colon mucosa tissue extract samples.Plasma and tissue samples were taken from patients at primary CRC surgery andanalyzed for MMP-9. Aliquots of samples from the same patients were stored at- 80 °C pending analysis. These aliquots were analyzed using identical methodsafter storage periods of nine (plasma) and twelve (tissue) years. No significant difference in plasma MMP-9 concentration was seen between baseline samples andthose after 9 years of cryopreservation (median values 9.9 and 9.7 ng/mL,respectively; p > 0.05). MMP-9 levels in the tumor-free tissue extracts hadincreased to baseline (median values 7.1 and 8.1 ng/mL, respectively; p < 0.01). MMP-9 levels in the tumor tissue extracts had also increased significantly(median values 89.9 and 133.5 ng/mL, respectively; p < 0.01). We havedemonstrated that MMP-9 levels in frozen citrated plasma are stable if stored at - 80 °C, whereas MMP-9 levels in extracts from tumor tissue and tumor-freeintestinal mucosa appear to increase with time. We conclude that MMP-9 levels in cryopreserved plasma may be considered stable over time and are thus suitable forcomparison purposes in consecutive series.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1109-4 PMCID: PMC5843695PMID: 29520667
