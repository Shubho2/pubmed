Thepentacyclic triterpenoid compounds oleanolic acid (OA) and glycyrrhetinic acid(GA) are distributed widely in nature.Methods: In this study, various oleanolic acids and glycyrrhetinic acids weredesigned and synthesized by using the combination principle. The in vitroanticancer activities of new OA and GA derivatives were tested by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method withSGC-7901 (gastric cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), Eca-109 (esophageal cancer),HeLa (cervical cancer), Hep-G2 (hepatoma cancer) and HSF (normal human skinfibroblast) cells.Results and conclusion: The screening results showed that the compound 3mpresented the highest inhibitory activities against SGC-7901, MCF-7 and Eca-109cell lines with IC50 values of 7.57±0.64 μM, 5.51±0.41 μM and 5.03±0.56 μM,respectively. In addition, this compound also showed effective inhibition ofHep-G2 cells with an IC50 value of 4.11±0.73 μM. Moreover, compound 5b showed thestrongest inhibitory activity against Hep-G2 cells with an IC50 value of3.74±0.18 μM and compound 3l showed strong selective inhibition of the HeLa cellswith the lowest IC50 value of 4.32±0.89 μM. A series of pharmacology experiments indicated that compound 5b could induce Hep-G2 cells autophagy and apoptosis.These compounds will expand the structural diversity of anti-cancer targets andconfirm the prospects for further research.DOI: 10.2147/DDDT.S166051 PMCID: PMC5968802PMID: 29861624
