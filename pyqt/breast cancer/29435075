Epub 2017 Dec28.BRCA1 homozygous unclassified variant in a patient with non-Fanconi anemia: Acase report.Davide B(1), Francesca M(2), Valeria P(3)(4), Irene F(1), Bernardo B(1).Author information: (1)Division of Cancer Prevention and Genetics, European Oncologic Institute,I-20141 Milan, Italy.(2)Research and Development, Cytogenetics and Molecular Biology, TOMA AdvancedBiomedical Assays S.p.A., I-21052 Busto Arsizio, Italy.(3)Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare (IFOM), I-20139 Milan, Italy.(4)Cogentech, Cancer Genetic Test Laboratory, I-20139 Milan, Italy.The present case report discusses a woman affected by chronic lymphatic leukemia and breast cancer with a familial history of breast cancer; suspected to behereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. The patient underwent BRCA1and BRCA2 genetic testing. Sequencing of BRCA1 revealed the presence of thevariant of unknown significance (VUS) c.3082C>T (p.Arg1028Cys) at homozygousstate, whereas no mutations were detected in BRCA2. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification confirmed the presence of two alleles. Althoughconsanguineity between her parents was reported, which therefore supported themolecular data, her clinical phenotype was not suggestive of typical Fanconianemia (FA), particularly of a BRCA1-linked FA. In the two cases reported in the literature, carriers of biallelic BRCA1 mutation present a severe and quitetypical phenotype. For this reason, the patient was offered a diepoxybutane test,where neither complex rearrangements nor multiradial formation were detected. We were therefore inclined to consider that BRCA1 VUS as of little clinicalsignificance.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7711 PMCID: PMC5778837PMID: 29435075
