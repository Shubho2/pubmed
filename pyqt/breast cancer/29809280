Herein, the AmericanCancer Society provides an overview of ovarian cancer occurrence based onincidence data from nationwide population-based cancer registries and mortalitydata from the National Center for Health Statistics. The status of earlydetection strategies is also reviewed. In the United States, the overall ovarian cancer incidence rate declined from 1985 (16.6 per 100,000) to 2014 (11.8 per100,000) by 29% and the mortality rate declined between 1976 (10.0 per 100,000)and 2015 (6.7 per 100,000) by 33%. Ovarian cancer encompasses a heterogenousgroup of malignancies that vary in etiology, molecular biology, and numerousother characteristics. Ninety percent of ovarian cancers are epithelial, the mostcommon being serous carcinoma, for which incidence is highest in non-Hispanicwhites (NHWs) (5.2 per 100,000) and lowest in non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) andAsians/Pacific Islanders (APIs) (3.4 per 100,000). Notably, however, APIs havethe highest incidence of endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas, which occur atyounger ages and help explain comparable epithelial cancer incidence for APIs andNHWs younger than 55 years. Most serous carcinomas are diagnosed at stage III(51%) or IV (29%), for which the 5-year cause-specific survival for patientsdiagnosed during 2007 through 2013 was 42% and 26%, respectively. For all stages of epithelial cancer combined, 5-year survival is highest in APIs (57%) andlowest in NHBs (35%), who have the lowest survival for almost every stage ofdiagnosis across cancer subtypes. Moreover, survival has plateaued in NHBs fordecades despite increasing in NHWs, from 40% for cases diagnosed during 1992through 1994 to 47% during 2007 through 2013. Progress in reducing ovarian cancerincidence and mortality can be accelerated by reducing racial disparities andfurthering knowledge of etiology and tumorigenesis to facilitate strategies forprevention and early detection.
