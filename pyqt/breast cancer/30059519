In the current study, we investigated the anticancer effects of thenatural product plumbagin (PL) on racially different TNBC cells. The PL effectswere examined in two TNBC cell lines: MDA-MB-231 (MM-231) and MDA-MB-468(MM-468), representing Caucasian Americans and African Americans, respectively.The results obtained indicate that PL inhibited cell viability and cellproliferation and induced apoptosis in both cell lines. Notably, MM-468 cellswere 5-fold more sensitive to PL than MM-231 cells were. Testing PL and Taxol®showed the superiority of PL over Taxol® as an antiproliferative agent in MM-468 cells. PL treatment resulted in an approximately 20-fold increase in caspase-3activity with 3 μM PL in MM-468 cells compared with an approximately 3-foldactivity increase in MM-231 cells with 8 μM PL. Moreover, the results indicate a higher sensitivity to PL in MM-468 cells than in MM-231 cells. The results alsoshow that PL downregulated CCL2 cytokine expression in MM-468 cells by 30%compared to a 90% downregulation in MM-231 cells. The ELISA results confirmed thearray data (35% vs. 75% downregulation in MM-468 and MM-231 cells, respectively).Moreover, PL significantly downregulated IL-6 and GM-CSF in the MM-231 cells.Indeed, PL repressed many NF-қB-regulated genes involved in the regulation ofapoptosis, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. The compound significantlydownregulated the same genes (BIRC3, CCL2, TLR2, and TNF) in both types of cells.However, PL impacted five more genes in MM-231 cells, including BCL2A1, ICAM1,IKBKE, IL1β, and LTA. In conclusion, the data obtained in this study indicatethat the quinone compound PL could be a novel cancer treatment for TNBC inAfrican American women.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0201116 PMID: 30059519
