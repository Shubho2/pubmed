PLP is found to generate intenseCL with lucigenin higher than that of the conventional lucigenin-H2O2 system by afactor of about 9.0. This new finding is used to be in a detection method for PLPvia flow injection analysis (FIA). Response is linear in the 50 nM to 200 μM PLP concentration range with a correlation coefficient of 0.998, and the detectionlimit (at an S/N of 3) is 6.9 nM. The assay is highly selective over variousamino acids, vitamins, sugars, coenzymes and metal ions cofactors. It exhibitsadvantages over the commonly employed HPLC methods in that it is rapid, moreeconomic, eco-friendly and high throughput FIA detection of PLP without the need for toxic derivatization reagents, organic solvents, and HPLC instrumentation.The method was successfully applied to the determination of PLP in (spiked) humanblood samples with recoveries in the range from 96.2-101.6% with % RSD < 4.0. Thenew system is also employed to determine lucigenin in the linear range of 0.3 to 100.0 μM with a correlation coefficient of 0.994 and the limit of detection is0.04 μM. Graphical abstract Schematic of the chemiluminescent assay for pyridoxal5'-phosphate (PLP). Lucigenin-PLP demonstrates 9-fold stronger chemiluminescence intensity than the lucigenin-H2O2 system. The detection limit of PLP is 6.9 nM.The method can detect PLP in human serum with good recoveries.DOI: 10.1007/s00604-018-2887-2 PMID: 30030633
