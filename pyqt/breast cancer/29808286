The use of a large, multi-nationalsurgical-outcomes database may provide a better understanding of treatmentpatterns and postoperative morbidity in men who undergo oncological breastsurgery.METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted between 2007 and 2016using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality ImprovementProgram database (NSQIP), examining MBC treatment patterns and postoperativecomplication rates. All men undergoing surgery for the treatment of invasive orin situ carcinoma of the breast were identified. Clinical characteristics,demographics, and surgical treatment options most frequently used for thispopulation were described. In addition, the 30-day postoperative complicationrates in the surgical treatment of male breast cancer were evaluated.RESULTS: A total of 1773 MBC patients with a median age of 65 years (IQR56-74 years) were included in this analysis. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 29.1 (IQR 25.4-33.8). In this study population, 177 (10.0%) had a diagnosis of in situbreast cancer, while the remaining 1596 (90.0%) had invasive disease. While most men underwent mastectomy, 282 (15.9%) had breast-conserving surgery. There were74 (4.2%) patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction. In addition,118 (6.7%) patients elected to have a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.Overall, the rate of morbidity was 4.6%, comprising mostly of wound complications(3.2%).CONCLUSION: Analysis of this large, prospective multi-institutional cohortrevealed that complication rates are low and comparable to reported rates in the female breast cancer population. What is also significant about this analysis is that the cohort demonstrated the importance of cosmetic considerations in MBCpatients, as some men decide to undergo breast-conserving surgery or immediatebreast reconstruction. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy in the treatment of MBC is also performed.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4830-y PMID: 29808286
