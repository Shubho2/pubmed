Kreipe.Hans@MH-Hannover.de.In addition to amplification, point mutations of the human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 (HER2) gene (ERBB2) have been shown to activate thecorresponding signaling pathway in breast cancer. The prevalence of ERBB2/HER2mutation in bone metastasis of breast cancer and the associated phenotype are notknown. In this study, bone metastases from breast cancer patients (n = 231) were analyzed for ERBB2/HER2 mutation. In 7 patients (3%; median age 70 years, range50-83 years), gain-of-function mutations of ERBB2/HER2 were detected. The mostfrequent mutation was p.L755S (71%). In 29% of mutated cases, p.V777L was found. Lobular breast cancer was present in 71% of mutated cases (n = 5) and in 49% ofall samples (n = 231; p = 0.275). Mutation frequency was 4.4% in the lobularsubgroup and 17.4% in the pleomorphic subtype of lobular cancer (n = 23),respectively. All but one mutated lobular cancers were of the pleomorphic subtype(p = 0.006). Mutated cancers belonged either to the luminal (n = 4) or to thetriple-negative types (n = 3). With regard to protein expression and geneamplification, HER2 was negative in all mutated cases. Among the 14% ofmetastatic luminal cancers with estrogen receptor gene (ESR1) mutation, conveyingresistance against aromatase inhibitors, no concomitant ERBB2/HER2 mutationoccurred. We conclude that activating HER2 mutation is present in about 3% ofbone metastases from breast cancers, with significantly higher rates in thepleomorphic subtype of lobular cancer. Since mutated cases appear to beHER2-negative by conventional testing, the opportunity for specific anti-HER2therapy may be missed.DOI: 10.1007/s00428-018-2414-1 PMID: 30094493
