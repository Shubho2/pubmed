Here, we describe the case of a woman with breast cancer recurrenceduring pregnancy and subsequent metastases. The focus of this study is the large amount of placenta metastases, which have been analyzed immunohistochemically.Staining with trophoblast markers (placenta alkaline phosphatase, beta humanchorionic gonadotropin and human placental lactogen) showed the strictlocalization of metastases in the intervillous space without invasion into fetal tissue. They have a large spheroidal shape and are free of blood vessels.Staining with Ki-67 revealed an outer proliferative shell and inner necroticcore. At week 28, a healthy newborn was born by elective cesarean section. A few weeks later, after surgery and FEC60 (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide)cycles, the patient died. Breast cancer metastases in the placenta are rarelydescribed. The special immunological environment in pregnancy may influencephenotype, growth, and behavior of tumor and metastases.Â© 2018 APMIS.
