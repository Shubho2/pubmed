This study was conducted to determine quality of life and itsrelationship with self-confidence in women undergoing treatment for breastcancer. Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive, analytical study wasconducted in 2016 on 166 women with breast cancer undergoing treatment at Ghazi, Al-Zahra, International and/or Shams hospitals in Tabriz. The subjects wereselected through convenience sampling. A personal-demographic questionnaire, the Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), and the Rosenberg Self-EsteemScale (RSES) were completed for each patient. The data obtained were analyzedusing independent t-tests, one-way ANOVA, multivariate linear regression andPearson’s correlation coefficients. Findings: The mean total score of quality of life was 59.1±17.4, ranging from 0 to 100. The highest mean score was obtained inthe cognitive subscale (74.9±23.8) and the lowest in the emotional subscale(51.4±21.1). The mean score for self-confidence was 0.3 with a standard deviationof 0.1, ranging from -1 to +1. There was a significant positive relationshipbetween self-confidence and quality of life, except in three symptom subscalesfor diarrhea, constipation and loss of appetite (P<0.05). Self-confidence,disease duration, lifestyle, marital satisfaction and caregiver status were amongthe predictors of quality of life. Discussion: Given the significant relationshipbetween quality of life and self-confidence, health care providers may need topay special attention to women undergoing treatment for breast cancer and performtimely measures to maintain their belief in themselves.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.3.733 PMCID: PMC5980849PMID: 29582628
