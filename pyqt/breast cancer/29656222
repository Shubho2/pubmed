Bioinformatic analysis and expression screening showed thatProlactin Induced Protein (PIP) was differentially expressed in BC. The objectiveof this investigation was to characterize the expression pattern of PIP, anaspartyl proteinase, in malignant and non-malignant breast tissues.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real time quantitative PCR was employed to analyze PIP andandrogen receptor (AR) mRNA levels in BC cell lines and 190 normal tissues andtumor samples. The tumor specimens were categorized based on TNM classification, anatomic stage, histologic grade and molecular subtype and expression patternevaluated. To detect protein levels, immunohistochemistry followed by semiquantitative scoring was employed in the examination of 517 normal, benign, andinvasive BC tissues.RESULTS: We observed substantial downregulation of PIP transcription in cancersamples compared to normal breast tissue. mRNA levels were significantlydownregulated (93 fold, P < 0.005) in advanced grades compared to lower grades.Transcript levels were also significantly lower (22 fold, P < 0.05) in triplenegative tumors compared to hormone receptor positive tumors. Significantdownregulation was observed in early stage samples of triple negative and hormonereceptor positive tumors. Though PIP protein showed a wide range of expressionlevels in BC, early stage samples showed significant downregulation.CONCLUSIONS: PIP mRNA is significantly downregulated in early stage BC comparedto normal breast tissue. Consequently, low PIP mRNA expression in BC tissuescould potentially be used as a tissue based biomarker to assist pathologists inconfirmation of early stage BC diagnosis.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
