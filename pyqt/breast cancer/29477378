We identified severalnovel candidates that decrease OCT4 expression and reduce theALDH + subpopulation both of which are characteristic of stemness. Furthermore,one of the novel candidates ICAM3 up-regulates in the ALDH + subpopulation, theside population and the developed spheres. ICAM3 knockdown reduces the sidepopulation, sphere formation and chemo-resistance in MDA-MB-231 human breastcancer cells and A549 lung cancer cells. In addition, mice bearingMDA-MB-231-shICAM3 cells develop smaller tumors and fewer lung metastases versus control. Interestingly, ICAM3 recruits and binds to Src by the YLPL motif in its intracellular domain which further activates the PI3K-AKT phosphorylationcascades. The activated p-AKT enhances SOX2 and OCT4 activity and therebymaintains cancer cell stemness. Meanwhile, the p-AKT facilitated p50 nucleartranslocation/activation enhances p50 feedback and thereby promotes ICAM3expression by binding to the ICAM3 promoter region. On this basis, Src and PI3Kinhibitors suppress ICAM3-mediated signaling pathways and reduce chemo-resistancewhich results in tumor growth suppression in vitro and in vivo. In summary, weidentify a potential CSC regulator and suggest a novel mechanism by which ICAM3governs cancer cell stemness and inflammation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
