It has to be emphasized that the figures areuncertain due to the limited number of patients. The variation is huge and thegreatest improvements are seen not least among the three major tumor diseases(breast, colorectal and prostate cancer), where the society, industry andresearch bodies made the biggest investments over the years. The causes ofimproved survival can be sought in several areas, such as earlier detection andbetter treatments. In addition to survival estimates, it is also always ofimportance to consider aspects around patient related outcome, such as quality oflife.PMID: 29738056
