SBeebe@odu.edu.A Pancreatic cancer is a notorious malignant neoplasm with an extremely poorprognosis. Current standard of care is rarely effective against late-stagepancreatic cancer. In this study, we assessed nanopulse stimulation (NPS) as alocal treatment for pancreatic cancer in a syngeneic mouse Pan02 pancreaticcancer model and characterized corresponding changes in the immune profile. Asingle NPS treatment either achieved complete tumor regression or prolongedoverall survival in animals with partial tumor regression. While this is veryencouraging, we also explored if this local ablation effect could also result in immune stimulation, as was observed when NPS led to the induction ofimmune-mediated protection from a second tumor challenge in orthotopic mousebreast and rat liver cancer models. In the Pan02 model, there were insufficientabscopal effects (1/10) and vaccine-like protective effects (1/15) suggestingthat NPS-induced immune mechanisms in this model were limited. To evaluate thisfurther, the immune landscape was analyzed. The numbers of both T regulatorycells (Tregs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in blood weresignificantly reduced, but memory (CD44‚Å∫) T-cells were absent. Furthermore, thenumbers of Tregs and MDSCs did not reduce in spleens compared to tumor-bearingmice. Very few T-cells, but large numbers of MDSCs were present in the NPStreated tumor microenvironment (TME). The number of dendritic cells in the TMEwas increased and multiple activation markers were upregulated following NPStreatment. Overall, NPS treatments used here are effective for pancreatic tumorablation, but require further optimization for induction of immunity or the need to include effective combinational NPS therapeutic strategy for pancreaticcancer.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10070217 PMCID: PMC6070875PMID: 29954062
