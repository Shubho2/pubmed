Median follow-up was 9months. Both groups had similar background variables. More all-grade adverseevents were seen in the TACE group (71% vs. 44%; p=0.02). Median overall survivalin the TACE group was 4.6 months compared to 12.9 months in the TARE group(p=0.2349). Treatment type was not an independent prognostic factor.CONCLUSION: TARE is better tolerated than TACE for the treatment ofliver-dominant breast cancer metastasis. There was a trend towards improvedsurvival with TARE; however, it did not approach statistical significance. Largerstudies are needed to validate these findings.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12563 PMID: 29715141  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
