Electronic address: daniel.strand@chem.lu.se.The polyether ionophore salinomycin has recently captured much interest due toits potent activity against multi-drug resistant cancer cells and cancer stemcells. Previous studies have shown that either acylation of the C20 position oresterification/amidation of the C1 carboxylate moiety is beneficial in terms ofbiological properties. In this paper, we present the first analogs combining suchmodifications. Evaluation of the anti-proliferative activity against a series of cancer cell lines showed that acylation of the C20 hydroxyl group improves theactivity of salinomycin C1 amides but not of the corresponding C1 esters.Importantly, the activity of several of the doubly modified analogs surpassesthat of commonly used cytostatic drugs cisplatin and doxorubicin in the LoVo/DXmulti-drug resistant cell line. All analogs were tested against primary acutelymphoblastic leukemia cells in standard cell viability assays; three were morepotent than salinomycin. Further studies revealed that selected analogs inducedcharacteristics of apoptotic cell death and increased expression of p53.Additionally, using an ex vivo model of breast tumor, tumor cell viabilitysignificantly decreased after treatment with salinomycin or its double-modifiedderivative (3a) in a time-dependent manner. The present findings indicate thatdouble-modified salinomycin derivatives constitute promising lead compounds fortargeting various types of cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
