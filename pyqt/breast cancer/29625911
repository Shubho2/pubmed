Our study measures the frequency of discrepancy between initial andsecond opinion breast imaging recommendations and evaluates the impact on patientmanagement.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on 504consecutive patients with second opinion breast radiology interpretationsperformed by 6 sub-specialized breast radiologists at a dedicated cancer centerfrom January 1, 2014 through September 1, 2014. Outside imaging reports werecompared with second opinion reports to categorize discrepancies. Interpretationswere considered discrepant in cases with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System(BI-RADS) category changes, recommendation for additional imaging, oridentification of previously undiagnosed additional extent of disease greaterthan 5 cm. The frequencies of discrepancy, alterations in surgical management,and incremental cancer detection were measured. Statistical analysis ofassociated factors was performed with the Fisher exact test, with a P-value < .05considered significant.RESULTS: Second opinion evaluation discrepancies were seen in 287 (57%) patients and resulted in percutaneous image-guided biopsies in 92 (18%). Forty-fiveadditional sites of cancer were biopsy-detected in 41 (8%) patients, including 20breast malignancies and 25 axillary metastases. Another 9 biopsies yieldedhigh-risk pathology. Second opinion interpretations altered surgical managementin 66 (13%) patients. Factors associated with increased discrepancy frequencywere cancer diagnosis at presentation (P = .004), dense breasts (P = .005), andthe absence of prior studies for comparison (P = .007).CONCLUSION: Although additional imaging and resources are required, secondopinion radiology review by subspecialized breast radiologists increases cancerdetection and results in clinically relevant changes in patient management.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
