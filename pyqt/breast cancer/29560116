To assess the prognostic role of a panel of miRNAsin breast cancer, we collected plasma prospectively at the time of initialdiagnosis from 1,780 patients with stage I-III breast cancer prior to definitive treatment. We identified plasma from 115 patients who subsequently developeddistant metastases and 115 patients without metastatic disease. Both groups were matched by: age at blood collection, year of blood collection, breast cancersubtype, and stage. The median follow up was 3.4 years (range, 1-9 years). Weextracted RNA from plasma and analyzed the expression of 800 miRNAs usingNanostring technology. We then assessed the expression of miRNAs in primary andmetastatic breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We foundthat, miR-24-3p was upregulated in patients with metastases, both in plasma andin breast cancer tissues. Patients whose primary tumors expressed high levels of miR-24-3p had a significantly lower survival rate compared to patients with lowmir-24-3p levels in the TCGA cohort (n=1,024). RNA-Seq data of the samples withthe highest miR-24-3p expression versus those with the lowest miR-24-3p in theTCGA cohort identified a specific gene expression signature for those tumors withhigh miR-24-3p. Possible target genes for miR-24-3p were predicted based on gene expression and binding site, and their effects on cancer pathways were evaluated.Cancer, breast cancer and proteoglycans were the top three pathways affected bymiR-24-3p overexpression.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24403 PMCID: PMC5849180PMID: 29560116
