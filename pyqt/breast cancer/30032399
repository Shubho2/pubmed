The Cochrane Library, PubMed,EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and four Chinese databases were searched forstudies published until January 2018. The review included all randomizedcontrolled trials that evaluated the effect of exercise on quality of lifecompared with that of usual care for people with breast cancer. Two reviewersindependently assessed the quality of all the included studies using the CochraneHandbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.RESULTS: In total, 36 studies (3914 participants) met the inclusion criteria. We divided the exercise into three modes: aerobic, resistance, and a combination of aerobic and resistance. All three modes of exercise intervention showed asignificant effect on quality of life between groups.CONCLUSIONS: Exercise is a safe and effective method of improving the quality of life in patients with breast cancer. In particular, combined training wasassociated with a significant improvement in quality of life. In future research,more high-quality, multicenter trials evaluating the effect of exercise in breastcancer patients are needed.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4363-2 PMID: 30032399
