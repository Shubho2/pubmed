The purpose of this study is to describe how health literacy is related to perceived coordination of carereported by breast cancer patients.METHODS: Data were retrieved from the Patient-Centered Outcomes ResearchInstitute-sponsored "Share Thoughts on Breast Cancer" Study including demographicfactors, perceived care coordination and responsiveness of care, andself-reported health literacy obtained from a mailed survey completed by 62% ofeligible breast cancer survivors (N = 1221). Multivariable analysis of variancewas used to characterize the association between presence of a single healthcare professional that coordinated care ("care coordinator") and perceived carecoordination, stratified by health literacy level.RESULTS: Health literacy was classified as low in 24% of patients, medium in 34%,and high in 42%. Women with high health literacy scores were more likely toreport non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, private insurance, higher education andincome, and fewer comorbidities (all p < 0.001). The presence of a carecoordinator was associated with 17.1% higher perceived care coordination scoresamong women with low health literacy when compared to those without a carecoordinator, whereas a coordinator modestly improved perceived care coordination among breast cancer survivors with medium (6.9%) and high (6.2%) health literacy.CONCLUSION: The use of a single designated care coordinator may have a stronginfluence on care coordination in patients with lower levels of health literacy.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4370-3 PMID: 30062586
