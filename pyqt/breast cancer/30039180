Here we reported that treatment with Adr upregulated CD155expression on several in vitro cultured breast cancer cells and in breast cancer cell 4T1 xenografts. We also found that CD155 knockdown or Adr treatment induced apoptosis of in vitro cultured cancer cells and cancer cells in 4T1 xenografts,and a combination of CD155 knockdown with Adr treatment induced more cell deaththan either of them. Furthermore, we revealed that the combination of CD155knockdown with Adr treatment suppressed the growth of 4T1 xenografts moresignificantly than them alone. In summary, our results demonstrate that CD155downregulation synergizes with Adr to induce breast cancer cell apoptosis,thereby to suppress tumor growth. Our results also suggest that CD155upregulation may be a mechanism underlying Adr resistance by breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1007/s10495-018-1473-8 PMID: 30039180
