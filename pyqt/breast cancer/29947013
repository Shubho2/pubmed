For development of targeted cancer therapy,attention is given to kinases rather than phosphatases inhibitors. Src homologyregion 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase2 (SHP2) is overexpressed in different types of cancers. We investigated the SHP2-inhibitory effects of twonew 5-aminosalicylate-4-thiazolinones in human cervical (HeLa) and breast (MCF-7 & MDA-MB-231) cancer cells. In-silico molecular docking showed preferentialaffinity of the two compounds towards the catalytic over the allosteric site ofSHP2. An enzymatic assay confirmed the docking results whereby 0.01 Î¼M of bothcompounds reduced SHP2 activity to 50%. On cellular level, the two compoundssignificantly reduced the expression of SHP2, KRAS, p-ERK and p-STAT3 in HeLa butnot in the other two cell lines. Phosphorylation of AKT and JNK was enhanced inHeLa and MCF7. Both compounds exhibited anti-proliferative/anti-migratory effectson HeLa and MCF7 but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results indicate thatinhibition of SHP2 and its downstream pathways by the two compounds might be apromising strategy for cancer therapy in some but not all cancer types.DOI: 10.1007/s10637-018-0626-5 PMID: 29947013
