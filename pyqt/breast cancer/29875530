The study thus aimed to analyze theimpact of combined medical and psychological (psychoeducation, relaxationtechnique-guided imagery, and cognitive therapy) interventions on stress and QoL of cancer patients - head and neck, breast, and lung cancers.Methods: The study was conducted in cancer hospitals employing one-grouppretest-posttest-preexperimental design. Descriptive statistics, paired t-test,Cohen's d, and bar graphs were used to analyze the data.Results: Findings showed high impact of the combined MPIs in reducing both theoverall stress as well as the various components of the stress scale-fear,psychosomatic complaints, information deficit, and everyday life restrictions.Significant changes were also seen in QoL and its domains - global health status,besides functional and symptom scales. Results showed a significant improvementin physical, role and emotional functioning scale, while decrement in fatigue,pain, insomnia, appetite loss, diarrhea, and constipation of symptoms scales.Conclusions: It can be concluded that combined MPI has a positive impact -decreasing stress and improving QoL in cancer patients, which can further enhancetheir prognosis.DOI: 10.4103/IJPSYM.IJPSYM_512_17 PMCID: PMC5968644PMID: 29875530
