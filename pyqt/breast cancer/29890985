Unfortunately, nearly half of women taking AIs report AI-associatedarthralgia (AIA), leading to therapy abandon in on third of patients, which couldlead to cancer recurrence. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate theeffectiveness of Neuromuscular Taping (NMT) in the treatment of AIA in women who have been treated of BC.METHODS: This study included 40 BC survivors receiving endocrine therapy (either AIs or TMX) from Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria (Málaga, Spain)suffered from AIA. Patients were randomized to one of the two groups that madethis pilot study: A. Placebo intervention B. Real NMT. Clinical data werecollected from medical history, grip strength, algometry measured, questionnairesand VAS scale. There have been three interventions prior to the completion of thestudy, 5 weeks later. The primary objective of this pilot study was to achieve animprovement of pain by 20% decrease of VAS.RESULTS: Significant differences in measures of VAS (p = 0.009), global healthstatus/QoL (p = 0.005), fatigue (p = 0.01) and pain (p = 0.04) were observed postintervention with NMT.CONCLUSIONS: An intervention by NMT to MSCM under treatment with AIs improvestheir subjective sensation of pain. In addition, this taping had an impact onvariables related to the quality of life. This pilot study may be the basis forothers to support the use of NMT for the treatment of AIAs, thereby improvingtheir well-being and reducing the dropout rate.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02406794 .
