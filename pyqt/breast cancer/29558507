A total of 112 men (125 breast masses) withpreoperative breast ultrasonography (US) were included (median age, 59.50 years; age range, 15-96 years). Data extracted included patient age, if the lesions werebilateral, palpable, and tender, and the presence of nipple discharge. Breastlesion features on static US images were reviewed by three experiencedradiologists without knowledge of physical examination or pathology results,original breast US image interpretations, or surgical outcomes. The US featureswere documented according to the BI-RADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and DataSystem) US lexicons. A forth radiologist compiled the data for analysis.RESULTS: Of the 125 breast masses, palpable tender lumps and bilateralsynchronous masses were more likely to be benign than malignant (both, 100% vs0%, P < 0.05). Advanced age and bloody discharge from nipples were common inmalignant lesions (P <0.05). A mass eccentric to a nipple, irregular shape, thepresence of an echogenic halo, predominantly internal vascularity, and rich colorflow signal on color Doppler ultrasound were significantly related to malignancy (all, P < 0.05). An echogenic halo and the presence of rich color flow signalwere independent predictors of malignancy.CONCLUSION: Specific clinical and US characteristics of male breast tumors mayhelp guide treatment, and determine if surgery or conservative treatment ispreferable.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0194651 PMCID: PMC5860767PMID: 29558507  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
