However, the function and underlying mechanisms ofmiR-150 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain unknown.Patients and methods: miR-150 expression was detected by qRT-PCR and ISH in TNBC tumor and adjacent normal breast tissues. miR-150 function was analyzed by wound healing and transwell assay in vitro and mouse lung metastasis model in vivo.mRNA microarray, qRT-PCR, western blotting and luciferase assay were used toidentify the target gene of miR-150. HMGA2 over-expression plasmid wasco-transfected with miR-150 to study the role of miR-150 through regulatingHMGA2.Results: We found that miR-150 was down-regulated in TNBC tumor tissues compared to corresponding adjacent, normal breast tissues, and was correlated withdecreased lymph-node metastasis. Ectopic expression of miR-150 suppressed TNBCcell migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistic study revealed thatmiR-150 down-regulates HMGA2 by directly targeting its mRNA. Moreover, thesuppression of cell migration caused by miR-150 is relieved by over-expression ofHMGA2, suggesting that miR-150 inhibits migration of TNBC cells bydown-regulating HMGA2.Conclusion: This work indicates that the miR-150/HMGA2 axis may serve as atreatment marker in TNBC.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S161996 PMCID: PMC5923219PMID: 29731640
