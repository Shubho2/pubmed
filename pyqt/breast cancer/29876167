This procedure had been developed to optimizethe esthetic outcome and reduce feeling mutilation after mastectomy. Risks ofnecrotic complications and diminishing nipple-areola complex (NAC) sensation are common complications affecting the patient's satisfaction after the surgery. The evaluation of NAC sensation should be also investigated.Methods: We prospectively analyzed 55 NSMs that were performed on 52 patients forboth therapeutic and prophylactic indications in Ramathibodi Hospital from May2007 to September 2015. Patients' demographics, operative details, oncologicoutcome, and postoperative complications, focusing on NAC sensation and necrotic complications, were analyzed.Results: Forty-seven NSMs (87%) were performed for therapeutic indications, andanother 7 NSMs (13%) were risk-reducing operations. Of the 43 patients performingNSM for breast cancer treatment, 33 patients (77%) had invasive cancer and 11patients (23%) had ductal carcinoma in situ. One subareola base tissue was found an occult cancer, and the NAC was then removed. There were 3 locoregionalrecurrences after a median follow-up time of 24 months (range, 2-104 months). TheNAC sensation was evaluated in a total of 35 patients. Twenty-five patients (46%)underwent serial evaluation after 6 months of operation, and 10 patients wereevaluated at more than 1 year after operation. In the first 6 months, 11 patients(44%) showed partial sensation recovery, and 3 more patients had partial recoveryafter 1-year follow-up. Only 1 patient (2%) had complete sensation recovery inall area of the NAC. In late evaluation group, 7 out of 10 patients had partialrecovery. Most pain sensation remained in the lower aspect of the areola awayfrom surgical incision.Conclusions: NSM is technically feasible in selected patients with low rates ofNAC removal. Some patients can preserve the NAC sensation. Long-term outcomeshould receive follow-up.DOI: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000001716 PMCID: PMC5977969PMID: 29876167
