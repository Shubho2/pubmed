Ewa.Huszcza@upwr.edu.pl.Synthesis of minor prenylflavonoids found in hops and their non-naturalderivatives were performed. The antiproliferative activity of the obtainedcompounds against some human cancer cell lines was investigated. Usingxanthohumol isolated from spent hops as a lead compound, a series of minor hopprenylflavonoids and synthetic derivatives were obtained by isomerization,cyclisation, oxidative-cyclisation, oxidation, reduction and demethylationreactions. Three human cancer cell lines-breast (MCF-7), prostate (PC-3) andcolon (HT-29)-were used in antiproliferative assays, with cisplatin as a control compound. Five minor hop prenyl flavonoids and nine non-natural derivatives ofxanthohumol have been synthetized. Syntheses of xanthohumol K, its dihydro- andtetrahydro-derivatives and 1″,2″,α,β-tetrahydroxanthohumol C were described forthe first time. All of the minor hops prenyl flavonoids exhibited strong tomoderate antiproliferative activity in vitro. The minor hops flavonoidsxanthohumol C and 1″,2″-dihydroxanthohumol K and non-natural2,3-dehydroisoxanthohumol exhibited the activity comparable to cisplatin. Resultsdescribed in the article suggest that flavonoids containing chromane- andchromene-like moieties, especially chalcones, are potent antiproliferativeagents. The developed new efficient, regioselective cyclisation reaction of thexanthohumol prenyl group to 1″,2″-dihydroxantohumol K may be used in thesynthesis of other compounds with the chromane moiety.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23040776 PMID: 29597299
