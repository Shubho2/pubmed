[Epub ahead of print]Information Needs Expressed During Patient-Oriented Oncology Consultations:Quantity, Variation, and Barriers.Ahamad A(1)(2), Wallner P(3), Salenius S(4), Ross R(4), Fernandez E(5).Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, 21st Century Oncology, 3426 North Roosevelt Boulevard, Key West, FL, 33040, USA. axa2011@med.miami.edu.(2)University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Lennar Foundation Medical Center, 5555 Ponce de Leon Blvd. Suite 140,Coral Gables, FL, 33146, USA. axa2011@med.miami.edu.(3)Department of Radiation Oncology, 21st Century Oncology, Inc. 146 SarazenDrive, Moorestown, NJ, 08057, USA.(4)Department of Research and Education, 21st Century Oncology, 2234 ColonialBoulevard, Fort Myers, FL, 33907, USA.(5)Department of Radiation Oncology, 21st Century Oncology, 350 NW 84th Ave #102, Plantation, FL, 33324, USA.High-quality oncology consultation includes patient-oriented communicationtailored to patients' individualized needs. Common methods used in studies toincrease question-asking are prompt lists and coaching pre-consultations.However, our patients were encouraged to ask questions by the physician duringtheir visit. We aimed to estimate the quantity, nature, and variation of theirquestions when they were invited to ask by their oncologist. During radiotherapy consultations from 2012 to 2016, patient's questions were deliberately elicitedand physician-transcribed. We derived mean and median number of questions perpatient, variance by patient factors, and a taxonomy of subjects using thematicanalysis. Three hundred ninety-six patients asked 2386 questions, median askedper patient = 6 (interquartile range = 4). We found significant variance with age(mean = 6.9 questions for < 60 years, 5.4 for ≥ 70 years) p = 0.018, insurancetype (mean = 4.7 for Medicaid, 7.2 for private insurance) p = 0.0004, and tumorsite (mean number of questions: skin = 4.6, lymphoma = 5.2, lung = 5.8,breast = 6.1, prostate = 6.3, rectum = 6.7 head and neck = 6.9, brain = 7.0,bladder = 7.2, anus = 8.8, others = 5.8) p = 0.0440. Of the diverse set of 57topics, the commonest were 1. logistics, 2. radiotherapy details, 3. sideeffects, 4. diagnosis, and 5. stage and prognosis. Only 17 topics were asked bymore > 10% of patients and 40 topics were asked by < 10% of patients. With medianof 6 questions, it is practicable to routinely elicit and address individualized information needs. Potential barriers may be older and underinsured patients. Thewide variety of topics, often pertaining to individuals' case, suggests thatcancer clinicians should take time-out during consultation to elicit patients'questions to accomplish best-practice communication.DOI: 10.1007/s13187-018-1329-5 PMID: 29435742
