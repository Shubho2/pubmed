However,the expression and function of LINP1 in cervical cancer is not yetwell-understood. In this study, we evaluated the expression levels of LINP1 intumor tissues and cell lines of cervical cancer. We found that LINP1 associateswith NHEJ proteins (Ku80 and DNA-PKcs). LINP1 translocates from cytosol tonucleus in response to irradiation. In addition, LINP1 knockdown significantlyincreases the levels of cleaved caspase3 and PARP, leading to enhanced cellapoptosis after ionizing radiation (IR). LINP1-knockdown cells showed delayedrepairs of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) after IR. Finally, LINP1 knockdownincreases radiosensitivity of Hela S3 cells. These results suggest that LINP1facilitates DSBs repair through NHEJ pathway and may thus serve as a prognosticmarker and a potential target for the therapy of cervical cancer.DOI: 10.1080/15384101.2018.1442625 PMCID: PMC5927633PMID: 29527968
