Delivery of PMRT was nonrandomized and performed according to institutional preferences. The presentanalysis was performed on participants with T1-T2 breast cancer and 1 to 3positive lymph nodes who had undergone mastectomy and axillary nodal dissection. The primary objective of the present study was to examine the effect of PMRT onrisk of locoregional recurrence (LRR), breast cancer-specific survival, andoverall survival.RESULTS: We identified 684 patients who met the inclusion criteria and wereincluded in the analysis, of whom 337 (49%) had received PMRT. At 10 years, LRRrisk was 2.5% in the PMRT group and 6.5% in the no-PMRT group (hazard ratio 0.29,95% confidence interval 0.12-0.73; P = .005). Lower LRR after PMRT was noted for patients randomized to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with no taxane (10-year LRR:3.4% vs 9.1%; P = .02). No significant differences in breast cancer-specificsurvival (84.3% vs 83.9%) or overall survival (81.7% vs 78.3%) were observedaccording to receipt of PMRT.CONCLUSION: Our analysis of the BIG 02-98 trial shows excellent outcomes in womenwith T1-T2 tumors and 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes found in axillary dissection.Although PMRT improved LRR in this cohort, the number of events remained low at10 years. In all groups, 10-year rates of LRR were relatively low compared withhistorical studies. As such, the use of PMRT in women with 1 to 3 positive nodes should be tailored to individual patient risks.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
