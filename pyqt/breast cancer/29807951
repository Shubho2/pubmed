Recent studies have shown thatperipheral soluble CD147 (sCD147) is increased in hepatocellular tumour andmultiple myeloma patients and correlated with disease severity. The primary aimof our study was to assess the level, as well as the biological and clinicalsignificance of sCD147 in breast cancer.METHODS: We tested plasma sCD147 levels in 308 breast cancer patients byenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay between February 2014 and February 2017. Asubset of 165 cases of benign breast diseases was included as a control group at the same period. We analysed the clinical significance of plasma sCD147 withrelevance to clinicopathological factors of breast cancer patients.RESULTS: Plasma sCD147 levels were significantly higher in patients with primary breast cancer than those with benign breast diseases (P=0.001), in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (T3-T4 tumour) than those in early breast cancer(T1-T2 tumour; P=0.001), in patients with lymph node metastasis than in thosewithout (P<0.001), and in patients with high recurrence risk than those withmedium recurrence risk (P<0.001). Plasma sCD147 levels were also significantlyhigher in the chemotherapy-resistant group than in the chemotherapy-sensitivegroup (P=0.040). Plasma sCD147 was an independent predictor for lymph nodemetastasis in breast cancer patients (P=0.001).CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that plasma sCD147 levels are elevated in breast cancer patients. Soluble CD147 is also associated with tumour size, lymph node metastasis, high recurrent risk, and chemoresistance. Ourfindings support that plasma sCD147 is an independent predictive factor for lymphnode metastasis.DOI: 10.12809/hkmj176865 PMID: 29807951
