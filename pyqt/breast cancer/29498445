This studyevaluates the impact of preoperative genetic testing on surgical decision making in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Women with newly diagnosed breastcancer were classified into preoperative or postoperative genetic testing group, depending on whether they received their genetic testing results prior to orafter their first surgery. Demographics, tumor characteristics, surgicaltreatment, and results of genetic testing were retrospectively collected. A totalof 997 patients were evaluated, 531 (53.3%) in the preoperative genetic testinggroup and 466 (46.7%) in the postoperative group. Majority (87.2%) ofBRCA-positive women in the preoperative group underwent bilateral mastectomy asfirst surgery. Majority (70.6%) of BRCA-positive women in postoperative groupunderwent partial mastectomy as first surgery prior to receiving their genetictesting result. Nearly half (41.2%) of these women in the postoperative groupwith partial mastectomy underwent bilateral mastectomy after receiving theirBRCA-positive result. Time from diagnosis to first surgery was longer in thepreoperative genetic testing group. Younger age, bilateral cancer,BRCA1/2-positive results, and preoperative genetic testing were significantpredictors of bilateral mastectomy at first surgery. Preoperative genetic testingimpacts initial surgical treatment in BRCA1/2-positive patients and reduces theneed for additional surgeries.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13007 PMID: 29498445
