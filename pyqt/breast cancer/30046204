The present study aimed to evaluate the classic and non-classiccharacteristics of MBC and its differences with IDC. The present review studyincorporates 22 years of practical experience from a breast disease researchcenter-based series of cases.Methods: Retrospectively, the medical records of 3,246 patients were reviewed in the Breast Disease Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Science (Shiraz,Iran), from December 1993 to December 2015. The tumor size, lymph nodemetastasis, pathologic stage, nuclear and histological grade, hormonal receptorstatus, recurrence, disease-free, and overall survival were reviewed. Differencesbetween medullary breast carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma were analyzedstatistically using the Chi-square, Fischer, independent-sample t test, andKaplan-Meier analysis (SPSS version 19.0). P<0.05 were considered statisticallysignificant.Results: A total of 179 patients were identified with MBC and 3,067 patients wereidentified with IDC. The MBC group had a significant association with a higherhistological grade (P<0.001) as well as negative estrogen receptor (P<0.001),progesterone receptor (P<0.001), and HER-2 (P=0.004) status. The MBC patientspredominantly had triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) according to the molecularsubtype (P<0.001). In local invasion, MBC was less invasive compared to IDC(P<0.001). The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) differedsignificantly between the MBC and IDC groups (5-year DFS: 94.2% vs. 86.3%,P=0.008; 5-year OS: 98.1% vs. 92.8%, P=0.004).Conclusion: Despite the poor and aggressive pathological features of MBC, itsclinical outcome is more favorable compared to IDC. Our findings can be useful inimprovement of diagnosis and treatment of less known breast cancer subtypes, suchas MBC.PMCID: PMC6055214PMID: 30046204
