Apostmenopausal woman with a medical history of stage 2 invasive ductal carcinoma,oestrogen receptor/progesterone receptor positive and human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 negative, in remission for 9 years, presented to her primarycare physician with concerns of increased urinary urgency, frequency andincontinence. The patient underwent cystoscopy with biopsy of an area ofgranulation tissue. Biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma consistent with breastprimary. The common sites of metastases from breast cancer are lung, bone andliver. This case is unique where breast cancer was found to metastasise to thebladder. It is important for physicians to consider further investigation when a breast cancer survivor develops urinary symptoms even without haematuria.© BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article)2018.
