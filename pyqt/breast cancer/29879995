InNorth Africa, many specific epidemio-genetic characteristics have been observedin breast cancer families when compared to Western populations. Despite thesespecificities, the majority of breast cancer genetics studies performed in North Africa remain restricted to the investigation of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Thus,comprehensive data at a whole exome or whole genome level from local patients arelacking.METHODS: A whole exome sequencing (WES) of seven breast cancer Tunisian families have been performed using a family-based approach. We focused our analysis onBC-TN-F001 family that included two affected members that have been sequencedusing WES. Relevant variants identified in BC-TN-F001 have been confirmed usingSanger sequencing. Then, we conducted an integrative analysis by combining ourresults with those from other WES studies in order to figure out the genetictransmission model of the newly identified genes. Biological network constructionand protein-protein interactions analyses have been performed to decipher themolecular mechanisms likely accounting for the role of these genes in breastcancer risk.RESULTS: Sequencing, filtering strategies, and validation analysis have beenachieved. For BC-TN-F001, no deleterious mutations have been identified on known breast cancer genes. However, 373 heterozygous, exonic and rare variants havebeen identified on other candidate genes. After applying several filters, 12relevant high-risk variants have been selected. Our results showed that thesevariants seem to be inherited in a family specific model. This hypothesis hasbeen confirmed following a thorough analysis of the reported WES studies.Enriched biological process and protein-protein interaction networks resulted in the identification of four novel breast cancer candidate genes namely MMS19,DNAH3, POLK and KATB6.CONCLUSIONS: In this first WES application on Tunisian breast cancer patients, wehighlighted the impact of next generation sequencing technologies in theidentification of novel breast cancer candidate genes which may bring newinsights into the biological mechanisms of breast carcinogenesis. Our findingsshowed that the breast cancer predisposition in non-BRCA families may be ethnicand/or family specific.DOI: 10.1186/s12967-018-1504-9 PMCID: PMC5992876PMID: 29879995
