Occasionally, the discovery of atumor-to-meningioma metastasis may herald the diagnosis of an occult primarymalignancy. Careful histopathological assessment of the resected meningiomaspecimen is pivotal to the management of these patients, as this will alter thetreatment plan and prognosis considerably. Intracranial meningioma with collisionbreast cancer as primary presentation of an undiagnosed metastatic breast cancer is extremely rare. The current study presents a case of intracranial meningiomawith collision breast cancer as a primary presentation, and reviews the availableevidence for this unusual disease entity.DOI: 10.3892/mco.2018.1589 PMCID: PMC5920372PMID: 29725531
