Electronicaddress: wgfang@bjmu.edu.cn.Our previous work has demonstrated that extracellular ATP is an importantpro-invasive factor, and in this study, we tapped into a possible mechanisminvolved. We discovered that ATP could upregulate both the intracellularexpression and secretion of S100A4 in breast cancer cells and fibroblasts. Apart from stimulating breast cancer cell motility via intracellular S100A4, ATPenhanced the ability of breast cancer cells to transform fibroblasts intocancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like cells, which in turn secreted S100A4 tofurther promote cancer cell motility. Both apyrase and niclosamide treatmentscould inhibit metastasis of inoculated tumors to lung, liver and kidney in micemodel, and CAFs from these treated tumors exhibited weakenedmigration-stimulating capacity for breast cancer cells. Collectively, our dataindicate that extracellular ATP promotes the interactions between breast cancercells and fibroblasts, which work collaboratively via production of S100A4 toexacerbate breast cancer metastasis.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
