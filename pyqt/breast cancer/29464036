Ourstudy showed that breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) mediated HER2 subtypeconversion and radioresistance in HER2-negative breast cancer cells and evaluatedserum HER2 as a clinical biomarker for HER2 subtype conversion. We found that theCD44+/CD24-/low BCSCs from HER2-negative breast cancer MCF7 cells overexpressedHER2 and EGFR and showed the radioresistant phenotype. In addition, we showedthat trastuzumab treatment sensitized the radioresistant phenotype of theCD44+/CD24-/low cells with decreased levels of HER2 and EGFR, which suggestedthat HER2-targeted therapy in HER2-negative breast cancer could be useful fortargeting BCSCs that overexpress HER2/EGFR. Importantly, our clinical data showedthat serial serum HER2 measurement synchronously reflected the disease relapseand the change in tumor burden in some patients who were initially diagnosed asHER2-negative breast cancer, which indicated that serum HER2 could be a clinical biomarker for the evaluation of HER2 subtype conversion in patients withrecurrent HER2-negative breast cancer. Therefore, our data have provided in vitroand in vivo evidence for the molecular subtype conversion of HER2-negative breastcancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23528 PMCID: PMC5814176PMID: 29464036
