The relationshipbetween RT and local recurrence is unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis thatrecurrence in some instances is due to the attraction of circulating tumor cells to irradiated tissues. To evaluate the effect of absolute lymphocyte count onlocal recurrence after RT in patients with TNBC, we analyzed radiation effects ontumor and immune cell recruitment to tissues in an orthotopic breast cancermodel. Recurrent patients exhibited a prolonged low absolute lymphocyte countwhen compared with nonrecurrent patients following RT. Recruitment of tumor cellsto irradiated normal tissues was enhanced in the absence of CD8+ T cells.Macrophages (CD11b+F480+) preceded tumor cell infiltration and were recruited to tissues following RT. Tumor cell recruitment was mitigated by inhibitingmacrophage infiltration using maraviroc, an FDA-approved CCR5 receptorantagonist. Our work poses the intriguing possibility that excessive macrophageinfiltration in the absence of lymphocytes promotes local recurrence after RT.This combination thus defines a high-risk group of patients withTNBC.Significance: This study establishes the importance of macrophages indriving tumor cell recruitment to sites of local radiation therapy and suggeststhat this mechanism contributes to local recurrence in women with TNBC that arealso immunosuppressed.Graphical Abstract:http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/15/4241/F1.large.jpg CancerRes; 78(15); 4241-52. ©2018 AACR.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-3623 PMCID: PMC6072588 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29880480
