Accumulating evidence indicates that LL-37 also plays a significantrole in human cancer. LL-37 induces tumorigenic effects in cancers of the ovary, lung, breast, prostate, pancreas, as well as in malignant melanoma and skinsquamous cell carcinoma. In contrast, LL-37 displays an anti-cancer effect incolon cancer, gastric cancer, hematologic malignancy and oral squamous cellcarcinoma. Mechanistically, LL-37-induced activation of membrane receptors andsubsequent signaling pathways lead to alteration of cellular functions. Differentmembrane receptors on various cancer cells appear to be responsible for thetissue-specific effects of LL-37. Meanwhile, the findings that vitaminD-dependent induction of cathelicidin in human macrophages activates theanti-cancer activity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and enhancesantibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) support critical roles of vitaminD-dependent induction of cathelicidin in cancer progression. This reviewdescribes novel advances involving the roles and mechanisms of human cathelicidinLL-37 in cancer.Â© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.
