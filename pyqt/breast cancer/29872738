PODXL is expressed in some types of human cancer tissues including oral, breast, and lung cancer tissues and may promote tumor growth, invasion, andmetastasis. We previously produced PcMab-47, a novel anti-PODXL monoclonalantibody (mAb) which reacts with endogenous PODXL-expressing cancer cell linesand normal cells independently of glycosylation in Western blot, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical analysis. In this study, we used enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical analysis to determine the epitope of PcMab-47. The minimum epitope of PcMab-47 was found tobe Asp207, His208, Leu209, and Met210. A blocking peptide containing this minimumepitope completely neutralized PcMab-47 reaction against oral cancer cells byflow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis. These findings could lead to theproduction of more functional anti-PODXL mAbs, which are advantageous forantitumor activities.DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrep.2018.04.003 PMCID: PMC5986553PMID: 29872738
