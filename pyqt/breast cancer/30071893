One biologic hypothesisunderlying this relationship may be via endogenous sex hormone levels. It isunclear if changes in dietary intake, physical activity, or both, are mosteffective in changing these hormone levels.OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the effect ofreduced caloric dietary intake and/or increased exercise levels on breastcancer-related endogenous sex hormones.METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, andCochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to March 2017. Mainoutcome measures were breast cancer-related endogenous sex hormones. Randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs) reporting effects of reduced caloric intake and/orexercise interventions on endogenous sex hormones in healthy, physically inactivepostmenopausal women were included. Studies including women using hormone therapywere excluded. The methodological quality of each study was assessed by theCochrane's risk of bias tool.RESULTS: From the 2599 articles retrieved, seven articles from six RCTs wereincluded in this meta-analysis. These trials investigated 1588 healthypostmenopausal women with a mean age ranging from 58 to 61 years. A combinedintervention of reduced caloric intake and exercise, with durations ranging from 16 to 52 weeks, compared with a control group (without an intervention to achieveweight loss) resulted in the largest beneficial effects on estrone treatmenteffect ratio (TER) = 0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83-0.97), totalestradiol TER = 0.82 (0.75-0.90), free estradiol TER = 0.73 (0.66-0.81), freetestosterone TER = 0.86 (0.79-0.93), and sex hormone biding globulin (SHBG)TER = 1.23 (1.15-1.31). A reduced caloric intake without an exercise interventionresulted in significant effects compared with control on total estradiolTER = 0.86 (0.77-0.95), free estradiol TER = 0.77 (0.69-0.84), free testosterone TER = 0.91 (0.84-0.98), and SHBG TER = 1.20 (1.06-1.36). Exercise without dietarychange, versus control, resulted in borderline significant effects onandrostenedione TER = 0.97 (0.94-1.00), total estradiol TER = 0. 97 (0.94-1.00), and free testosterone TER = 0. 0.97 (0.95-1.00).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This meta-analysis of six RCTs demonstrated that thereare beneficial effects of exercise, reduced caloric dietary intake or,preferably, a combination of exercise and diet on breast cancer-relatedendogenous sex hormones in physically inactive postmenopausal women.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1009-8 PMID: 30071893
