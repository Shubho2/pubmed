Although mostcases of gastric cancers are sporadic, one of its inherited forms, hereditarydiffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), constitutes about 1-3% of cases. Interestingly,females in families with HDGC are also predisposed to developing lobular breastcancer (LBC). Recent analyses have identified loss-of-function germline mutationsin cadherein-1 (CDH1) as a culprit in HDGC and LBC. This discovery fueled severalsequencing analyses and case series reports analyzing the pattern of inheritance of CDH1 and its propensity to induce HDGC. In 2015, a multinational andmultidisciplinary task force updated the guidelines and criteria for screening,diagnosing, and managing HDGC.CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present a case series of three siblings with familyhistory of HDGC who tested positive for the CDH1 mutation and describe theirsurgical treatment course, post-operative management, and follow-up as theypertain to the updated guidelines.CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent updates in guidelines in the diagnosis and managementof HDGC, the disease remains challenging to address with patients given the high level of uncertainty and the comorbidities associated with prophylacticintervention. We strongly recommend that an interdisciplinary team inclusive ofclinical and surgical oncologists, along with geneticists, social work, andpsychological support, should follow the patients in a longitudinal andcomprehensive manner in order to achieve full recovery and return to normalcy, aswith our patients.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1415-5 PMCID: PMC6046101PMID: 30007404
