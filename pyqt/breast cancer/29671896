[Epub ahead of print]Subgroups from regression trees with adjustment for prognostic effects andpostselection inference.Loh WY(1), Man M(2), Wang S(3).Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, U.S.A.(2)Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN 46285, U.S.A.(3)BioStat Solutions, Inc, Frederick, MD 21703, U.S.A.Identification of subgroups with differential treatment effects in randomizedtrials is attracting much attention. Many methods use regression tree algorithms.This article addresses 2 important questions arising from the subgroups: how toensure that treatment effects in subgroups are not confounded with effects ofprognostic variables and how to determine the statistical significance oftreatment effects in the subgroups. We address the first question by selectively including linear prognostic effects in the subgroups in a regression tree model. The second question is more difficult because it falls within the subject ofpostselection inference. We use a bootstrap technique to calibrate normal-theory t intervals so that their expected coverage probability, averaged over all thesubgroups in a fitted model, approximates the desired confidence level. It canalso provide simultaneous confidence intervals for all subgroups. The firstsolution is implemented in the GUIDE algorithm and is applicable to data withmissing covariate values, 2 or more treatment arms, and outcomes subject to rightcensoring. Bootstrap calibration is applicable to any subgroup identificationmethod; it is not restricted to regression tree models. Two real examples areused for illustration: a diabetes trial where the outcomes are completelyobserved but some covariate values are missing and a breast cancer trial wherethe outcome is right censored.Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/sim.7677 PMID: 29671896
