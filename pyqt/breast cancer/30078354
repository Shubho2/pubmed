To support this malignant phenotype, cells acquire molecularalterations that abrogate or bypass control mechanisms in signaling pathways and cellular checkpoints that normally function to prevent genomic instability anduncontrolled cell proliferation. Consequently, therapeutic targeting of the cell cycle has long been viewed as a promising anti-cancer strategy. Until recently,attempts to target the cell cycle for cancer therapy using selective inhibitorshave proven unsuccessful due to intolerable toxicities and a lack of targetspecificity. However, improvements in our understanding of malignantcell-specific vulnerabilities has revealed a therapeutic window for preferential targeting of the cell cycle in cancer cells, and has led to the development ofagents now in the clinic. In this review, we discuss the latest generation ofcell cycle targeting anti-cancer agents for breast cancer, including approvedCDK4/6 inhibitors, and investigational TTK and PLK4 inhibitors that are currentlyin clinical trials. In recognition of the emerging population of ER+ breastcancers with acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors we suggest new therapeutic avenues to treat these patients. We also offer our perspective on the directionof future research to address the problem of drug resistance, and discuss themechanistic insights required for the successful implementation of thesestrategies.DOI: 10.1080/15384101.2018.1502567 PMID: 30078354
