Changes inmammographic density after tamoxifen discontinuation were assessed qualitatively (decrease, no change, or increase) by two readers and measured quantitatively by semi-automated software. The association between % density change andclinicopathological factors was evaluated using univariate and multivariateregression analyses.RESULTS: After tamoxifen discontinuation, a mammographic density increase wasobserved in 31.9% (68/213, reader 1) to 22.1% (47/213, reader 2) by qualitativeassessment, with a mean density increase of 1.8% by quantitative assessmentcompared to density before tamoxifen discontinuation. In multivariate analysis,younger age (≤ 39 years) and greater % density decline after tamoxifen treatment (≥ 17.0%) were independent factors associated with density change after tamoxifendiscontinuation (p < .001 and p = .003, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen discontinuation was associated with mammographic densitychange with a mean density increase of 1.8%, which was associated with youngerage and greater density change after tamoxifen treatment.KEY POINTS: • Increased mammographic density after tamoxifen discontinuation can occur in premenopausal women. • Mean density increase after tamoxifendiscontinuation was 1.8%. • Density increase is associated with age and densitydecrease after tamoxifen.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-017-5293-y PMID: 29626240
