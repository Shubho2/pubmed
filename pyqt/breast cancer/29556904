There is an urgent need to develop a simple method to detect the MT1-MMP expression level on cells. In this current study, we demonstrated a red emission Au cluster probes with the specific targeting of MT1-MMP on human dopaminergicneuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells. More importantly, utilizing the intrinsicenzyme-like activity of the Au cluster probes, the expression level of MT1-MMP onthe SH-SY5Y cells could be assessed by the naked eye without cell lysis andprotein extraction process. Furthermore, SH-SY5Y, human breast cancer (MCF-7),and human bronchial epithelial (16-HBE) cell lines with different MT1-MMPexpression level could be distinguished using the Au cluster probes by the naked eye. Meanwhile, fluorescence intensity and Au count determined by inductivelycoupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were used to verify the feasibility of this simple analytical method. Our proposed method is rapid, convenient, andaccurate and could be assessed by the naked eye. This visual assessment method oftumor-associated proteins has immense implications in sorting tumor cells.DOI: 10.1007/s11427-017-9261-9 PMID: 29556904
