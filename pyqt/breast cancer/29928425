China.The aim of the present study is to study the expressions of suppressor ofcytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 in the tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues ofpatients with breast cancer. The study was also planned to investigate theassociation of SOCS-1 gene expression with patients' clinical pathology,molecular subtype and prognosis. A total of 60 cases of frozen andparaffin-embedded specimens of tumor tissues and corresponding adjacent normaltissues of patients with breast cancer were selected. Reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detectthe expression levels of SOCS-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in the patients' tumortissues and adjacent normal tissues. The immunohistochemical method was appliedto detect the expressions of SOCS-1 proteins in the patients' breast cancertissues and adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, the correlations of SOCS-1 proteinexpressions in breast cancer tissues with patients' pathological parameters,molecular subtypes and prognosis were analyzed in combination with the clinicaldata. The results of RT-qPCR showed that the SOCS-1 mRNA expression in breastcancer tissues was significantly lower than that in adjacent normal tissues(p<0.01). The immunohistochemical results indicated that the positive expression rate of the SOCS-1 proteins in breast cancer tissues (23.33%) was remarkablylower than that in adjacent normal tissues (88.33%) (p<0.01). The low expression of SOCS-1 in breast cancer tissues was related to lymph node metastasis andclinical staging. The positive expression rates of the luminal A SOCS-1 proteins were the highest (47.62%) (p<0.01). The 5-year overall survival rate of thebreast cancer patients was 63.33% (38/60). The univariate survival analysisrevealed that the patients with low expression of SOCS-1 had poorer prognosis. Inconclusion, the low expression of SOCS-1 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer; in particular, it is associated with the lymph node metastasis andclinical staging of the tumor; so, the SOCS-1 expression in breast cancer tissuescan be regarded as an important reference for the prognostic estimation of breastcancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8675 PMCID: PMC6006450PMID: 29928425
