HER2 amplification/overexpression, which has beenassociated with an increased risk of brain metastasis in breast cancer, is found in about 20% of patients with GAD. The aim of this study was to evaluate theeffect of HER2 status on brain metastasis in GAD. The database of a tertiarycancer center was searched for patients with GAD diagnosed in 2011-2015, and datawere collected on clinical characteristics, brain metastasis, HER2 status, andoutcome. We identified 404 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of GAD. HER2results were available for 298: 69 (23.2%) positive and 227 negative. Brainmetastasis developed in 15 patients with GAD (3.7%); HER2 results, available in13, were positive in 6, negative in 6, and equivocal in 1. The brain metastasisrate was significantly higher in HER2-positive than HER2-negative patients withGAD (6/69, 8.7% vs. 6/227, 2.6%; RR = 3.3, 95% CI 1.1-9.9, p = 0.034). Medianoverall survival from diagnosis of brain metastasis was 2.3 months, with nosignificant difference by HER2 status. HER2 positive GAD patients may be atincreased risk to develop BM. Clinicians should maintain a lower threshold forperforming brain imaging in patients with HER2-positive GAD given their increasedrisk of brain metastasis. The role of anti-HER2 agents in the development andtreatment of brain metastasis in GAD warrants further study.DOI: 10.1007/s11060-018-2798-4 PMID: 29429124
