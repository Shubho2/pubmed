However, the possibility of stopping dexamethasone premedication has been investigated in previous studies to reduce the steroid's adverse events;however, either the result or the particular protocol was limited. Thus, ourstudy aimed to evaluate the incidence of HSR after dexamethasone premedicationdiscontinuation after lack of HSR in two previous weekly paclitaxel infusions.METHOD: Early breast cancer patients who received adjuvant weekly paclitaxel in aretrospective cohort from January 2012 through February 2016 at the KingChulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were reviewed. All patients received a standardpremedication protocol prior to the first and second paclitaxel infusion.Dexamethasone was omitted in later cycles in all patients who did not undergoinfusion HSR. Patients who developed HSR during the first or second cycles ofpaclitaxel infusion were excluded. The incidence of HSR during the later cycle ofpaclitaxel administration and factors associated with this adverse reaction were collected.RESULTS: Eighty-one of 85 patients who did not undergo infusion HSR after2 cycles of weekly paclitaxel administration were retrospectively reviewed. Themedian age was 51 years (range 27-74 years). Only 16% of the patients had a BMIgreater than 30 kg/m2, 57.8% were premenopausal, 67.9% had no comorbidity, nonehad a history of allergy or asthma, 65.4% received weekly paclitaxel as a single agent, and 34.6% received weekly paclitaxel in combination with trastuzumab. Fiveof 81 patients reported grade I-II HSR (6.25%), which occurred mostly during the first 6 cycles (60%). Temporary discontinuation of paclitaxel infusion wasobserved in all HSR patients. No differences regarding age, BMI, menopausalstatus, and underlying disease between the HSR and no HSR groups were identified.Concerning the safety profile, peripheral neuropathy (gr I 60%, gr II 13.5%, and gr III 2.4%), myalgia (43.4%), and edema (10.5%) were commonly reported, whereas dyspepsia (5.3%) and insomnia (14.5%) were rarely described in withholdingpatients.CONCLUSION: Withholding dexamethasone premedication in non-experiencing HSRpatients after two previous cycles of weekly paclitaxel administration was safeand did not impact the higher incidence of HSR. A discontinuing dexamethasoneprotocol should be recommended generally in these patients, especially those witha high risk for steroid-induced side effects.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4087-3 PMID: 29435713
