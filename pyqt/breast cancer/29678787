Electronic address:arun.iyer@wayne.edu.Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive tumor subtype,lacking estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER-2)receptors. Thus, early detection and targeted therapy of TNBC is an urgent need. Herein, we have developed a CD44 targeting Hyaluronic Acid (HA) decoratedbiocompatible oligomer, containing FDA approved vitamin E TPGS and Styrene MaleicAnhydride (SMA) (HA-SMA-TPGS) for targeting TNBC. The self-assembling HA-SMA-TPGSwas encapsulated with poorly water soluble, potent curcumin analogue (CDF) toform nanomicelles (NM), HA-SMA-TPGS-CDF has demonstrated excellent nanoparticlecharacteristics for parenteral delivery. The targeted NM can selectively killTNBC cells through CD44 mediated apoptosis pathway. Tumor imaging using phase-2clinical trial near infrared (NIR)-fluorescent dye (S0456) conjugate,HA-SMA-TPGS-S0456 showed excellent TNBC tumor accumulation with minimum liver andspleen uptake. To our best of knowledge, for the first time, we are reporting apromising platform for CD44 mediated multimodal NIR imaging and cytotoxindelivery to TNBC.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
