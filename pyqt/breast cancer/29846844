In this commentary, we use examples in breast cancer risk assessmentand survivorship to demonstrate how the failure to appropriately incorporatesocial factors into the design, recruitment, and analysis of research studies hasresulted in missed opportunities to reduce persistent cancer disparities. Theconclusion offers recommendations for how to better document and use information on social factors in cancer research and care by (1) increasing education andawareness about the importance of inclusion of social factors in clinicalresearch; (2) improving testing and documentation of social factors byincorporating them into journal guidelines and reporting stratified results; and (3) including social factors to refine extant tools that assess cancer risk andassign cancer care. Implementing the recommended changes would enable moreeffective design and implementation of interventions and work toward eliminating cancer disparities by accounting for the social and environmental contexts inwhich cancer patients live and are treated.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1043-y PMCID: PMC5999161PMID: 29846844
