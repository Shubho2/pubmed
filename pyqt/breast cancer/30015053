Electronic address:he53@mail.aub.edu.Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), which occurs when malignant cells spread to thecentral nervous system, is becoming an increasingly common complication inpatients with breast cancer. Diagnosis and treatment of LM is challenging.Moreover, prognosis of patients with LM is poor, with a median survival of 6months after diagnosis. This review highlights the strengths and limitations ofcurrently available diagnostic tools and therapies for LM. The current treatmentsfor LM, including radiotherapy, systemic therapy, and intrathecal treatment, aim to maintain the quality of life of patients by correcting neurological deficitsand arresting neurological degeneration. However, there is no standardizedtherapy for LM because of a lack of randomized trials on this condition.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
