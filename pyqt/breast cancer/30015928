China.Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is typically fatal if untreated. It ischaracterized by early and widespread metastases, and has the ability to rapidly develop resistance to chemotherapy. Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7), a memberof the BMP family of signaling molecules, has been implicated in various types ofcancer, particularly prostate cancer and breast cancer. However, there is little knowledge of the function of BMP7 in SCLC. The aim of the present study was toinvestigate the biological function of recombinant human (rh)BMP7 on SCLC cellsand the underlying molecular basis for this regulatory mechanism. The effect ofrhBMP7 on SCLC cell lines and associated signaling pathways was investigated.Results suggested that rhBMP7 significantly inhibited the proliferation, motilityand invasion of SBC-3 and SBC-5 cells. However, rhBMP7 exhibited no effect on theapoptosis of SBC-5 cells, but promoted apoptosis of SBC-3 cells. Furthermore,cell cycle analysis revealed that rhBMP7 was able to increase the proportion ofcells in G1 phase and decrease the S phase proportion. Total and membrane BMPreceptor (BMPR)IA and BMPRIB were highly expressed in SBC-5 cells, whereascytoplasmic BMPRIA and BMPRIB expression was higher in SBC-3 cells. However,activin A receptor type I expression was higher in SBC-3 cells in total andcytoplasmic proteins. Furthermore, following stimulation with rhBMP7, Smad2,Smad4 and p21 were downregulated. We hypothesized that rhBMP7 inhibited theprogressiveness of SCLC cells by inducing G1 phase arrest and inhibiting S phase entry. The results of the present study indicated that BMP7 serves a key functionin regulating the progression of SCLC.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4469 PMID: 30015928
