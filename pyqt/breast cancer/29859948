The purpose of the current work isto investigate sources of error in T2* measurements and the relationship between T2* and DCE and DWI functional parameters in breast cancer.METHODS: Five female volunteers and thirty-two women with biopsy proven breastcancer were scanned at 3 T, with Research Ethics Committee approval. T2* valuesof the normal breast were acquired from high-resolution, low-resolution andfat-suppressed gradient-echo sequences in volunteers, and compared. In breastcancer patients, pre-treatment T2*, DCE MRI and DWI were performed at baseline.Pathologically complete responders at surgery and non-responders were identified and compared. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) wereperformed.RESULTS: There were no significant differences between T2* values fromhigh-resolution, low-resolution and fat-suppressed datasets (p > 0.05). Therewere not significant differences between baseline functional parameters inresponders and non-responders (p > 0.05). However, there were differences in the relationship between T2* and contrast-agent uptake in responders andnon-responders. Voxels of similar characteristics were grouped in 5 clusters, andlarge intra-tumoural variations of all parameters were demonstrated.CONCLUSION: Breast T2* measurements at 3 T are robust, but spatial resolutionshould be carefully considered. T2* of breast tumours at baseline is unrelated toDCE and DWI parameters and contribute towards describing functional heterogeneityof breast tumours.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
