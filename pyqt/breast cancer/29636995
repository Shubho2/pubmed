However, its effect against breast cancer israrely reported. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of As2S2 in human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and further elucidatedits underlying mechanisms. As2S2 significantly inhibited cell viabilities,induced apoptosis, and led to cell cycle arrest in both cell lines with a dose-and time-dependent manner. As2S2 upregulated pro-apoptotic proteins like p53 and PARP in MCF-7 cells. Besides, As2S2 downregulated anti-apoptotic proteins likeBcl-2 and Mcl-1, as well as cell cycle-related proteins cyclin A2 and cyclin D1in both cell lines. Of note, the expression level of cyclin B1 was downregulated in MCF-7 cells, whereas, upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, As2S2significantly inhibited the pro-survival signals in PI3K/Akt pathway in both celllines. In conclusion, As2S2 inhibited cell viabilities, induced apoptosis andcell cycle arrest in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines by regulating theexpression of key proteins involved in related pathways. These results providefundamental insights into the clinical application of As2S2 for treatment ofpatients with breast cancer.PMCID: PMC5883090PMID: 29636995
