THIQs are cytotoxic agents with potential anticancer activities. Theaim of this in vitro study was to investigate the modes of cell death induced by four nonsteroidal THIQ-based analogs, such as STX 2895, STX 3329, STX 3451 andSTX 3450, on MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast and A549 epithelial lung carcinomacells.Materials and methods: Cytotoxicity studies determined the half-maximal growthinhibitory concentration of the analogs to be at nanomolar concentrations withoutthe induction of necrosis. Light and fluorescent microscopy determined thatcompounds caused microtubule depolymerization and displayed morphologicalhallmarks of apoptosis.Results: Flow cytometric analyses confirmed apoptosis induction as well as anincreased G2/M phase on cell cycle analysis. Furthermore, intrinsic pathwaysignaling was implicated due to increased cytochrome c release and a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Potential involvement of autophagy wasobserved due to increased acidic vacuole formation and increased aggresomeactivation factor.Conclusion: Thus, it can be concluded that these four THIQ-based analogs exertanti-proliferative and antimitotic effects, induce apoptosis and involveautophagic processes. Further investigation into the efficacy of these potential anticancer drugs will be conducted in vitro and in vivo.DOI: 10.2147/DDDT.S152718 PMCID: PMC6025772PMID: 29983544
