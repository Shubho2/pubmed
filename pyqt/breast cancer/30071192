Electronic address:lfliegel@ualberta.ca.The mammalian Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is an integral membrane proteinthat regulates intracellular pH (pHi) by removing a single intracellular protonin exchange for one extracellular sodium ion. It is involved in cardiachypertrophy and ischemia reperfusion damage to the heart and elevation of itsactivity is a trigger for breast cancer metastasis. NHE1 has an extensive 500amino acid N-terminal membrane domain that mediates transport and consists of 12 transmembrane segments connected by intracellular and extracellular loops.Intracellular loops are hypothesized to modulate the sensitivity to pHi. In this study, we characterized the structure and function of intracellular loop 5 (IL5),specifically amino acids 431-443. Mutation of eleven residues to alanine causedpartial or nearly complete inhibition of transport; notably, mutation of residuesL432, T433, I436, N437, R440 and K443 demonstrated these residues had criticalroles in NHE1 function independent of effects on targeting or expression. Thenuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution spectra of the IL5 peptide in amembrane mimetic sodium dodecyl sulfate solution revealed that IL5 has a stablethree-dimensional structure with substantial alpha helical character. NMRchemical shifts indicated that K438 was in close proximity with W434. Overall,our results show that IL5 is a critical, intracellular loop with a propensity to form an alpha helix, and many residues of this intracellular loop are critical toproton sensing and ion transport.Copyright Â© 2018.
