In this study, we identified a pro-survivalsignalling protein BCL2- associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) to be highly expressed ina subset of TNBC cell lines and tumour tissues. High mRNA expression of BAG3 inTNBC patient cohorts significantly associated with a lower recurrence freesurvival. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is amplified in TNBC andEGFR signalling dynamics impinge on cancer cell survival and disease recurrence. We found a correlation between BAG3 and EGFR expression in TNBC cell lines anddetermined that BAG3 can regulate tumour cell proliferation, migration andinvasion in EGFR expressing TNBC cells lines. We identified an interactionbetween BAG3 and components of the EGFR signalling networks using massspectrometry. Furthermore, BAG3 contributed to regulation of proliferation inTNBC cell lines by reducing the activation of components of the PI3K/AKT andFAK/Src signalling subnetworks. Finally, we found that combined targeting of BAG3and EGFR was more effective than inhibition of EGFR with Cetuximab alone in TNBC cell lines. This study demonstrates a role for BAG3 in regulation of distinctEGFR modules and highlights the potential of BAG3 as a therapeutic target inTNBC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24590 PMCID: PMC5884656PMID: 29644001
