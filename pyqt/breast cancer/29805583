Its upregulation in various types of cancer has been linked tonumerous genetic factors; however, the nature of the involvement of epigeneticmechanisms, including DNA methylation, remains elusive. In the present study,E2F4 expression profiles were determined in 100 paired breast tumor and controlsamples, through RT-qPCR using the SYBR® green method. Furthermore, the E2F4promoter methylation status in each of these samples was assessed usingmethylation specific PCR, in order to evaluate its impact on gene expression. Atwo-fold increase in E2F4 gene expression was observed in the breast tumorscompared with in their respective controls (P=0.022); of these tumors, ~72% were under-methylated. The change in methylation status was also significantly higher (P<0.001) in the tumor samples. Methylation status was negatively correlated(r=-30) with E2F4 expression profiles, indicating that a decrease in methylation may promote higher expression of E2F4. The two study cohorts (>45 and ≤45 years) had comparable methylation profiles, though they had significantly decreasedmethylation status compared with controls. Various histo-pathological types also have different methylation profiles, indicating the presence of a tissue specificmethylation signature. The results of the present study demonstrated that E2F4methylation status can have a notable influence on its expression, and that itmay have prognostic value in breast carcinogenesis.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8382 PMCID: PMC5950537PMID: 29805583
