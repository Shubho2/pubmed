In the current study, wefirst demonstrated that the expression of Airn was reduced in TNBC tissues andcells. Our data showed that the level of Airn was reduced in TNBC tissues andcell lines compared with that of normal control. Furthermore, silencing of Airnmarkedly enhanced MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Meanwhile, knockdown of Airnsignificantly increased MDA-MB-231 cell invasion. Western blot analysis showedthat knockdown of Airn markedly enhanced the activation ofWnt/β-catenin/mTOR/PI3K in both MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, real time PCRanalysis showed that the mRNA level of IGF2R was significantly enhanced when Airnwas silenced in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, overexpression of IGF2Rsignificantly increased MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion. To furtherexplore whether Airn activated Wnt/β-catenin/mTOR/PI3K signaling independent ofIGF-2R, a specific siRNA targeting IGF2R was selected. Western blot analysisshowed that Wnt/β-catenin/mTOR/PI3K signaling could be largely activated inMDA-MB-231 cells transfected with siRNA targeting Airn, even when the proteinlevel of IGF2R was silenced. In summary, decreased expression of lncRNA Aimenhanced the malignant invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells mainly by activating Wnt/β-catenin/mTOR/PI3K signaling independent of Igf2R.DOI: 10.1691/ph.2017.7547 PMID: 29441885
