Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2018 Apr 25;19(4):885-889.Association of BRCA1 Promoter Methylation with Breast Cancer in Asia: A Meta-AnalysisNindrea RD(1), Harahap WA, Aryandono T, Lazuardi L.Author information: (1)Doctoral Program, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia.Email: ricvandana7@gmail.comObjective: The aim of this study was to determine the degree of association ofBRCA1 promoter methylation with breast cancer in Asia. Methods: The study sample for the present meta-analysis was provided by published research articles onassociations of BRCA1 promoter methylation with breast cancer in Asia accessedthrough databases on PubMed, ProQuest and EBSCO published between 1997 andNovember 2017. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated with fixed andrandom-effect models. Data were processed using Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3). Results: Of a total of 475 articles, 11 studies were included in our systematicreview with meta-analysis of relevant data. The results showed a highlysignificant association between BRCA1 promoter methylation with breast cancer in Asia (OR = 8.78 [95% CI 4.15-18.56, p < 0.00001]). Conclusion: This analysisconfirmed association between BRCA1 promoter methylation and breast cancer inAsia. BRCA1 promoter assessment might be a predictive or diagnostic aid forbreast cancer prediction.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.885 PMCID: PMC6031799PMID: 29693332
