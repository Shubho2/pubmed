Acute post-operative pain following mastectomy remains a challenge forthe anaesthesiologist despite a range of treatment options available. The presentstudy aimed to compare the post-operative analgesic efficacy of pectoral nerve(Pecs) block performed under ultrasound with our standard practice of opioids andnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for mastectomy.Methods: This randomised controlled study was conducted at a tertiary careteaching hospital in India, after obtaining ethical clearance. Fifty adult femalepatients posted for elective unilateral modified radical mastectomy were divided into two groups as follows: Group I (general anaesthesia only) and Group II(general anaesthesia plus ultrasound-guided Pecs block), each comprising 25patients. Post-randomisation, patients in Group I received general anaesthesia,while Group II patients received ultrasound-guided Pecs block followed by generalanaesthesia after 20 min. The primary outcome was measured as patient-reportedpain intensity using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at rest. Statistical analysiswas performed using Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test. Data were enteredinto MS Excel spreadsheet and analysis was performed using the StatisticalPackage for the Social Sciences version 23.0.Results: VAS score was significantly lower in Group II at rest and on abductionpost-operatively at all time intervals (P < 0.001). The 24-h tramadol consumptionwas significantly less in Group II compared to Group I (114.4 ± 4.63 mg vs.402.88 ± 74.22, P < 0.0001).Conclusion: Pecs block provided excellent post-operative analgesia in the first24 h.DOI: 10.4103/ija.IJA_523_17 PMCID: PMC6004763PMID: 29962525
