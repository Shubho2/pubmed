This study describes healthcare utilization (HRU)and costs among premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC in real-world settingsfrom a payer's perspective.METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, premenopausal women with HR+/HER2-mBC who received ET or chemotherapy were identified from the Truven HealthAnalytics MarketScan database (1 January 2006-31 December 2015). The main HRUoutcomes per patient per 6 months (PPP6 M) were measured during each line oftherapy and included number of days in inpatient (IP) and outpatient (OP)services. Healthcare costs per patient per month (PPPM) included medical andpharmacy costs.RESULTS: A total of 3203 patients received first-line, 2194 received second-line,and 1242 received third-line therapy for mBC. Mean number of IP days PPP6 M were 1.6, 1.3, and 1.5 days in the first, second, and third lines, respectively. Mean number of days with OP services PPP6 M was 31.4, 30.9, and 23.3 in the first,second, and third lines, respectively. Among patients receiving ET, mean totalhealthcare costs were $6521, $4440, and $4555 PPPM in the first, second, andthird line, respectively. Among patients receiving chemotherapy, mean totalhealthcare costs were $16,842, $12,868, and $16,129 PPPM in the first, second,and third line, respectively. These costs were mainly driven by treatment and OP costs.CONCLUSION: Real-world HRU and costs among premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBCare extensive. Patients who received chemotherapy incurred approximately twicethe costs of patients treated with ET.FUNDING: Novartis Pharmaceutical Corp.DOI: 10.1007/s12325-018-0689-x PMID: 29556908
