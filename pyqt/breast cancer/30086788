Up to 80% of individuals with a Li-Fraumeni-like phenotype do notharbor detectable causative germline TP53 variants. Yet, no systematic panelanalyses for a wide range of cancer predisposition genes have been conducted oncohorts of women with breast cancer fulfilling Li-Fraumeni(-like) clinicaldiagnostic criteria.METHODS: To specifically help explain the diagnostic gap of TP53 wild-typeLi-Fraumeni(-like) breast cancer cases, we performed array-based CGH (comparativegenomic hybridization) and panel-based sequencing of 94 cancer predispositiongenes on 83 breast cancer patients suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome who hadpreviously had negative test results for causative BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53germline variants.RESULTS: We identified 13 pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants inten patients and in nine genes, including four copy number aberrations and ninesingle-nucleotide variants or small indels. Three patients presented asdouble-mutation carriers involving two different genes each. In five patients (5 of 83; 6% of cohort), we detected causative pathogenic variants in establishedhereditary breast cancer susceptibility genes (i.e., PALB2, CHEK2, ATM). Fivefurther patients (5 of 83; 6% of cohort) were found to harbor pathogenic variantsin genes lacking a firm association with breast cancer susceptibility to date(i.e., Fanconi pathway genes, RECQ family genes, CDKN2A/p14ARF, and RUNX1).CONCLUSIONS: Our study details the mutational spectrum in breast cancer patients suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome and indicates the need for intensifiedresearch on monoallelic variants in Fanconi pathway and RECQ family genes.Notably, this study further reveals a large portion of still unexplainedLi-Fraumeni(-like) cases, warranting comprehensive investigation of recentlydescribed candidate genes as well as noncoding regions of the TP53 gene inpatients with Li-Fraumeni(-like) syndrome lacking TP53 variants in codingregions.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1011-1 PMCID: PMC6081832PMID: 30086788
