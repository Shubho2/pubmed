[Epubahead of print]ZFX acts as a transcriptional activator in multiple types of human tumors bybinding downstream of transcription start sites at the majority of CpG islandpromoters.Rhie SK(1), Yao L(1), Luo Z(1), Witt H(1), Schreiner S(1), Guo Y(1), Perez AA(1),Farnham PJ(2).Author information: (1)University of Southern California.(2)University of Southern California peggy.farnham@med.usc.edu.High expression of the transcription factor ZFX is correlated with proliferation,tumorigenesis, and patient survival in multiple types of human cancers. However, the mechanism by which ZFX influences transcriptional regulation has not beendetermined. We performed ChIP-seq in four cancer cell lines (representing kidney,colon, prostate, and breast cancers) to identify ZFX binding sites throughout thehuman genome. We identified ~9,000 ZFX binding sites and found that the majority of the sites are in CpG island promoters. Moreover, genes with promoters bound byZFX are expressed at higher levels than genes with promoters not bound by ZFX. Todetermine if ZFX contributes to regulation of the promoters to which it is bound,we performed RNA-seq analysis after knockdown of ZFX by siRNA in prostate andbreast cancer cells. Many genes with promoters bound by ZFX were downregulatedupon ZFX knockdown, supporting the hypothesis that ZFX acts as a transcriptional activator. Surprisingly, ZFX binds at +240 bp downstream of the TSS of theresponsive promoters. Using Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome Sequencing(NOMe-seq), we show that ZFX binds between the open chromatin region at the TSSand the first downstream nucleosome, suggesting that ZFX may play a critical rolein promoter architecture. We have also shown that a closely related zinc fingerprotein ZNF711 has a similar binding pattern at CpG island promoters, but ZNF711 may play a subordinate role to ZFX. This functional characterization of ZFXprovides important new insights into transcription, chromatin structure, and the regulation of the cancer transcriptome.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.DOI: 10.1101/gr.228809.117 PMCID: PMC5848610PMID: 29429977
