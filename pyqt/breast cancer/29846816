Epub2018 May 30.Impact of various lipophilic substituents on ruthenium(II), rhodium(III) andiridium(III) salicylaldimine-based complexes: synthesis, in vitro cytotoxicitystudies and DNA interactions.Cassells I(1), Stringer T(1), Hutton AT(1), Prince S(2), Smith GS(3).Author information: (1)Department of Chemistry, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, 7701, SouthAfrica.(2)Department of Human Biology, University of Cape Town, Medical School,Observatory, 7925, South Africa.(3)Department of Chemistry, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, 7701, SouthAfrica. Gregory.Smith@uct.ac.za.A series of bidentate salicylaldimine ligands was prepared and reacted witheither [RuCl(µ-Cl)(p-cymene)]2, [RhCl(µ-Cl)(Cp*)]2 or [IrCl(µ-Cl)(Cp*)]2. All of the compounds were characterised using an array of spectroscopic and analyticaltechniques, namely, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) wasused to confirm the bidentate coordination mode of the salicylaldimine ligand to the metal centre. The platinum group metal (PGM) complexes were screened against the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. The ruthenium and iridium salicylaldiminecomplexes showed comparable or greater cytotoxicity than cisplatin against theMCF7 cancer cells, as well as greater cytotoxicity than their rhodiumcounterparts. Three of the salicylaldimine complexes showed potent activity inthe range 18-21 µM. Two of these complexes had a greater affinity for cancerouscells than for CHO non-cancerous cells (SI > 4). Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the ruthenium complexes undergo solvation prior to 5'-GMP binding,whereas the iridium complexes were inert to the solvation process.DOI: 10.1007/s00775-018-1567-3 PMID: 29846816
