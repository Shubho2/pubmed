Cancer patients have a high incidence rate of venous thrombosiscomplication and increase the mortality of cancer patients for 2-8 times. Themechanisms involved in human cancers and venous thrombosis remains unclear. Inthis study, we determined miR-21 expressed higher in human breast cancer, coloncancer and hepatocellular cancer tissues compared with normal tissues andexpressed higher in exosomes of breast cancer and hepatocellular cancer celllines compared with normal cells. MiR-21 dramatically suppressed proliferation,migration and invasion of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which performedpromoting role in thrombus repairment and resolution. High levels of miR-21 inexosomes of human cancers dramatically inhibited behaviors of EPCs, and depletionof miR-21 abrogated the decreased proliferation, migration and invasion of EPCsinduced by human cancer cells. Moreover, IL6R (interleukin 6 receptor) wasidentified to be a direct target of miR-21 and promoted cell proliferation,migration and invasion of EPCs. Therefore, the miR-21-IL6R pathway contributed tobehaviors of EPCs and consequently mediated the vein thrombosis in patients with cancer. MiR-21-IL6R pathway based therapeutic methods would be beneficial todecrease the complicated venous thrombosis in cancer patients and promotethrombus resolution.Copyright Â© 2018.
