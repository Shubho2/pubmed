[Epub ahead of print]Estrogen Metabolism in Postmenopausal Women Exposed In-utero toDiethylstilbestrol.Troisi R(1), Hatch EE(2), Palmer JR(3), Titus L(4), Sampson JN(5), Xu X(6),Hoover RN(7).Author information: (1)Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NIH troisir@mail.nih.gov.(2)Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Healthcine.(3)Section of Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology, Boston University School ofMedicine.(4)Departments of Epidemiology and Pediatrics, Geisel School of Medicine atDartmouth, Norris Cotton Cancer Center.(5)Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute.(6)Cancer Research Technology Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.,Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research.(7)Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute;National Institute of Health.BACKGROUND: Prenatal diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure is associated with adversereproductive outcomes and cancer of the breast and vagina/cervix in adult women. DES effects on estrogen metabolism have been hypothesized, but reproductivehormone concentrations and metabolic pathways have not been comprehensivelydescribed.METHODS: Blood samples were provided by 60 postmenopausal women (40 exposed,20unexposed) who were participants in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Combined DES Cohort Study, had never used hormone supplements or been diagnosed withcancer, had responded to the most recent Cohort Study questionnaire, and livedwithin driving distance of Boston University Medical School. Parent estrogens andtheir metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Age-adjusted % changes in geometric means andassociated 95% confidence intervals (CI) between the exposed and unexposed werecalculated.RESULTS: Concentrations of total estrogens (15.3%; CI: -4.1%, 38.5%) and parentestrogens (27.1%; CI: -8.2, 76.1) were slightly higher in the DES-exposed thanunexposed. Ratios of path2:parent estrogens (-36.5%; CI: -53.0%, -14.3%) andpath2:path16 (-28.8%; CI: -47.3%, 3.7%) were lower in the DES-exposed. Theseassociations persisted with adjustment for total estrogen, years since menopause,body mass index, parity and recent alcohol intake.CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that postmenopausal women who wereprenatally DES exposed may have relatively less 2 than 16 pathway estrogenmetabolism compared with unexposed women.IMPACT: Lower 2 pathway metabolism has been associated with increasedpostmenopausal breast cancer risk and could potentially offer a partialexplanation for the modest increased risk observed for prenatally DES exposedwomen.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0135 PMID: 30049842
