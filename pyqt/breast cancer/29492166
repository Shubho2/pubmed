Sulindac sulfide amide (SSA), an amide analog of sulindac sulfide,shows insignificant COX-related activity and toxicity while enhancing anticancer activity in vitro and demonstrating in vivo xenograft activity.Objective: Develop structure-activity relationships in the sulindac amine series and identify analogs with promising anticancer activities.Method: A series of sulindac amine analogs were designed and synthesized and thenfurther modified in a "libraries from libraries" approach to produce amide,sulfonamide and N,N-disubstituted sulindac amine sub-libraries. All analogs were screened against three cancer cell lines (prostate, colon and breast).Results: Several active compounds were identified viain vitro cancer cell linescreening with the most potent compound (26) in the nanomolar range.Conclusion: Compound 26 and analogs showing the most potent inhibitory activitymay be considered for further design and optimization efforts as anticancer hitscaffolds.DOI: 10.2174/1874104501812010001 PMCID: PMC5817852PMID: 29492166
