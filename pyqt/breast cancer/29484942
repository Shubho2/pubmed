A 36-year-old woman presents with a large symptomatic left flankmass that had been slowly increasing in size. Multiple synchronous subcutaneousmasses were found at presentation on the left breast, right auricle and rightcheek. After diagnosis of granular cell tumour by core needle biopsy, the masses were excised with histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of bothspecimens confirming the presence of non-malignant granular cell tumours.Granular cell tumours are rare Schwann cell derived tumours that are typicallyasymptomatic and benign. These tumours are most often located in the head andneck, with multifocal disease present in approximately 5-16% of patients. Finalpathology is necessary for diagnosis and frozen section is rarely helpful.Malignancy is present in approximately 2% of cases and can be diagnosed by thepresence of a high mitotic rate, large nucleoli, necrosis, spindling andpleomorphism are other suspicious features. Granular cell tumours do notgenerally require adjuvant treatment. The mainstay of therapy is surgicalresection with surveillance.DOI: 10.1308/rcsann.2018.0016 PMCID: PMC5958858 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29484942  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
