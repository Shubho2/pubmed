Epub 2018Feb 10.The importance of histological assessment after neoadjuvant therapy and the need for standardisation.Naidoo K(1), Pinder SE(2).Author information: (1)Department of Histopathology, St Thomas' Hospital, Westminster Bridge Rd,London SE1 7EH, UK; Institute of Cancer Research, 237 Fulham Road, London SW36JB, UK.(2)Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London, Innovation Hub, Guy'sComprehensive Cancer Centre, Guy's Hospital, Great Maze Pond, London SE1 9RT, UK.Electronic address: Sarah.pinder@kcl.ac.uk.Neoadjuvant therapy is increasingly being recognised as a management option forpatients with primary invasive breast carcinoma; this may take the form ofprimary endocrine treatment or primary chemotherapy. Surgical specimens fromwomen treated with neoadjuvant treatments, particularly primary chemotherapy, maycause a challenge for the histopathologist in handling and interpretation andhave, in the past, been sampled, evaluated, and reported in a non-standardisedway. This limits comparison between clinical trials and potentially providesclinicians and patients with suboptimal prognostic information. We describe here some of the difficulties faced and the recommendations and standards now applied.Copyright © 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
