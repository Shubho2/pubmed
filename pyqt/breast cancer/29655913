Electronic address: jponcology@sina.com.(2)Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, PRChina.Multidrug resistance (MDR) usually causes chemotherapy failure of chronicmyelogenous leukemia (CML). Germacrone is a terpenoid compound and has beenreported to reverse MDR in breast cancer cells. However, the effect of germacroneon MDR in CML cells was unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate theeffect of germacrone on MDR in adriamycin resistance of CML cells. Treatment witha combination of germacrone and adriamycin synergistically inhibited theviability and increased LDH release in K562/ADM cells. Adriamycin induced theapoptosis and caspase-3 activity of K562/ADM cells, and the germacrone treatment significantly enhanced the induction. Adriamycin treatment inhibited theexpression of Bcl-2 and induced the expression of Bax, and germacrone enhancedthe effect of adriamycin. Germacrone decreased adriamycin-induced expression ofMDR1 mRNA and P-gp protein. Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) reversed the effect of germacrone on adriamycin resistance in K562/ADM cells. In conclusion,germacrone reversed adriamycin resistance in human chronic myelogenous leukemiaK562/ADM cells by suppressing MDR1 gene/P-gp expression. The results indicatedthat germacrone might be a new MDR reversal agent for CML chemotherapy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
