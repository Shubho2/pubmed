In response to the mandate that all cells should be authenticated, we discovered that the MDA-MB-231 cells that were in use in ourlab, did not validate based on the alleles of 9 different markers (STR Profile). We had been using this line as a model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)that has the ability to form tumors in immuno-compromised mice. Based on markeranalysis, these cells most closely resembled the MCF10A line, which are a neardiploid and normal mammary epithelial line. Yet, the original cells expresscarbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) both constitutively and in response to hypoxia andare features that likely drive the aggressive nature of these cells. Thus, wesought to sub-purify CAIX-expressing cells using Fluorescence Activated CellSorting (FACS). These studies have revealed a new line of cells that we have nameUFH-001, which have the TNBC phenotype, are positive for CAIX expression, bothconstitutively and in response to hypoxia, and behave aggressively in vivo. Thesecells may be useful for exploring mechanisms that underlie progression,migration, and metastasis of this phenotype. In addition, constitutive expressionof CAIX allows its evaluation as a therapeutic target, both in vivo and in vitro.DOI: 10.1080/15384047.2018.1449612 PMCID: PMC5989806 [Available on 2019-04-13]PMID: 29561695
