In 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, thepretreatment with TNF-α increased tumor Dox concentration. The accumulation ofDox was even higher when systemically injected with a micellar formulation ofDox. This work provides a rationale for testing the combination on breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.4155/tde-2017-0101 PMID: 29681232
