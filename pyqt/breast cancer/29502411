Nanobodies (Nbs) are the smallest antibody-derived fragments withbeneficial characteristics for molecular imaging and radionuclide therapy.Therefore, HER2-targeting nanobodies could offer a valuable platform forradioimmunotherapy, especially when labeled with α-particle emitters, whichprovide highly lethal and localized radiation to targeted cells with minimalexposure to surrounding healthy tissues. In this study, the anti-HER22Rs15d-nanobody was conjugated with2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraaceticacid ( p-SCN-Bn-DOTA) and radiolabeled with an α-emitter 225Ac with a high yield (>90%) and a radiochemical purity above 95%. The 225Ac-DOTA-Nb binding affinitywas 4.12 ± 0.47 nM with an immunoreactive fraction above 80%. Binding to lowHER2-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells was negligible, whereas HER2-overexpressingSKOV-3 cells could be blocked with an excess of unlabeled nanobody, confirmingthe specificity of binding. Noncompeting binding to HER2 was observed in thepresence of an excess of trastuzumab. The cell-associated fraction of225Ac-DOTA-Nb was 34.72 ± 16.66% over 24 h. In vitro, the radioconjugate wastoxic in an HER2-mediated and dose-dependent manner, resulting in IC50 values of 10.2 and 322.1 kBq/mL for 225Ac-DOTA-Nb and the 225Ac-DOTA control, respectively,on SKOV-3 cells, and 282.2 kBq/mL for 225Ac-DOTA-Nb on MDA-MB-231 cells. Ex vivo biodistribution studies, performed in mice bearing subcutaneousHER2-overexpressing and low HER2-expressing tumors, showed a fast uptake inSKOV-3 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 (4.01 ± 1.58% ID/g vs 0.49 ± 0.20% ID/gafter 2 h), resulting also in high tumor-to-normal tissue ratios. In addition,coinjection of 225Ac-DOTA-Nb with Gelofusine reduced kidney retention by 70%.This study shows that 225Ac-DOTA-Nb is a promising new radioconjugate fortargeted α-particle therapy and supports its further development.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00985 PMID: 29502411
