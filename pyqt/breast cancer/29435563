During a mean (SD) follow-up of 6.3 (3.2) years,10 929 invasive breast cancers were diagnosed in a cohort of 403 268 women 65years and older with data from 472 220 mammography examinations. We estimated the5-year cumulative incidence of invasive breast cancer by first-degree familyhistory, breast density, and age groups. Cox proportional hazards models were fitto estimate the association of first-degree family history with risk of invasive breast cancer (after adjustment for breast density, BCSC registry,race/ethnicity, body mass index, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, and benignbreast disease for age groups 65 to 74 years and 75 years and older, separately).Data analyses were performed between June 2016 and June 2017.Exposure: First-degree family history of breast cancer.Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident breast cancer.Results: In 403 268 women 65 years and older, first-degree family history wasassociated with an increased risk of breast cancer among women ages 65 to 74years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.35-1.61) and 75 years and older (HR,1.44; 95% CI, 1.28-1.62). Estimates were similar for women 65 to 74 years withfirst-degree relative's diagnosis age younger than 50 years (HR, 1.47; 95% CI,1.25-1.73) vs 50 years and older (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.17-1.51) and for women ages75 years and older with the relative's diagnosis age younger than 50 years (HR,1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.63) vs 50 years and older (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.33-1.81).Among women ages 65 to 74 years, the risk associated with first-degree familyhistory was highest among those with fatty breasts (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.27-2.21),whereas in women 75 years and older the risk associated with family history washighest among those with dense breasts (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.29-1.87).Conclusions and Relevance: First-degree family history was associated withincreased risk of invasive breast cancer in all subgroups of older womenirrespective of a relative's age at diagnosis.DOI: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2017.8642 PMCID: PMC5876845 [Available on 2019-02-12]PMID: 29435563
