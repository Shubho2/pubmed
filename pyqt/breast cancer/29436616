The present in vitro study evaluated theirantitumor synergistic effects on MDA‑MB‑231 breast cancer cells characterized by the triple‑negative phenotype (TNP). The anti-proliferative effects of these two agents were evaluated by MTT and clonogenic assays. Cell cycle progression wasexamined using propidium iodide staining. Apoptosis was investigated by Annexin Vlabeling, and by examining caspase 3 activity and DNA fragmentation. Autophagicvesicles and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were monitored by flowcytometry. Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate molecular targets. Ourresults revealed that when used alone, PTX and SIM exerted antitumor effects.Nevertheless, used in combination, the inhibition of cell proliferation wassynergistically superior (80% vs 42%) than that observed following treatment witheach agent alone after 48 h. PTX alone (0.5 mM) induced both apoptosis (25%) and autophagy (25%); however, when used in combination with SIM (0.5 µM), the balancebetween these processes was disrupted and the cells underwent apoptosis (>65%) asopposed to autophagy (<13%). This imbalance was associated with an increase inERK1/2 and AKT activation, but not with an increase in mTOR phosphorylation, and with the suppression of the NF-κB pathway. In addition, in the cells treated withboth agents, almost 78% of the cells were arrested at the G0/G1 phase and losttheir colony-forming ability (38±5%) compared to the cells treated with PTX alone(115±5%). On the whole, these results suggest that the induction of autophagy maybe a protective mechanism preventing MDA‑MB‑231 cancer cell death. The combineduse of PTX and SIM may drive dormant autophagic cancer cells to undergo apoptosisand thus this may be a novel treatment strategy for breast cancer characterizedby the TNP.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4272 PMID: 29436616
