We previously identified a novel peptide SA12 which showed significantactivity in the inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in SKBr-3 cells.Methods: The present study investigated the potential antitumor role of SA12 inbreast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 through Cell Counting Kit-8 assayand colony formation assay, and examined the cell cycle distribution using flowcytometry analysis. Furthermore, the expression of cell cycle-related genescyclin D1, CDK4, and tumor suppressor gene p16 were examined by real-timepolymerase chain reaction and Western blot to explore the molecular mechanism.Results: We determined that peptide SA12 suppressed the proliferation ofMDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines through the G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest.Moreover, the expressions of cell cycle-associated genes cyclin D1 and CDK4 were downregulated and the expression of tumor suppressor gene p16 was upregulatedafter treatment with SA12. MECP2 was required for the enhanced expression of p16 gene induced by SA12, which further inhibits CDK4/CDK6 activation and arrests thecell cycle progression from G0/G1 to S phase.Conclusion: We concluded that SA-12 inhibits the proliferation of MCF-7 andMDA-MB-231 cells through G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle related genes cyclinD1, CDK4, and p16 participate in the process, and MECP2 is essential for theenhanced expression of p16 gene induced by SA-12.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S154337 PMCID: PMC5935185PMID: 29750041
