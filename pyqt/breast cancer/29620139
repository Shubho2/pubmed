Cellular processes, includingdifferentiation, proliferation and survival are regulated by these receptors. Thepresent study aimed to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of imatinibmesylate, and its effects on apoptotic induction and cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cell lines. In addition, the study aimed to determine whether the effects of this drug were associated with the mRNA and protein expression levels ofPDGFR‑β, c‑Kit, and their corresponding ligands PDGF‑BB and stem cellfactor (SCF), which may potentially modulate cell survival and proliferation. To assess the antiproliferative effects of imatinib mesylate, an MTS assay wasconducted following treatment of cells with 2‑10 µM imatinib mesylate for 96, 120and 144 h; accordingly the half maximal inhibitory concentration of imatinibmesylate was calculated for each cell line. In addition, the proapoptotic effectsand cytostatic activity of imatinib mesylate were investigated. To evaluate theexpression of imatinib‑targeted genes, PDGFR‑β, c‑Kit, PDGF‑BB and SCF, underimatinib mesylate treatment, mRNA expression was detected using semi‑quantitativepolymerase chain reaction and protein expression was detected by western blotanalysis in ZR‑75‑1 and MDA‑MB‑231 breast carcinoma cell lines. Treatment withimatinib mesylate suppressed cell proliferation, which was accompanied byapoptotic induction and cell cycle arrest in the investigated cell lines. Inaddition, PDGFR‑β, PDGF‑BB, c‑Kit and SCF were expressed in both breast carcinomacell lines; PDGFR‑β and c‑Kit, as imatinib targets, were downregulated inresponse to imatinib mesylate treatment. The present results revealed that atleast two potential targets of imatinib mesylate were expressed in the two breastcarcinoma cell lines studied. In conclusion, the antiproliferative, cytostaticand proapoptotic effects of imatinib mesylate may be the result of a reduction inthe expression of c‑Kit and PDGFR tyrosine kinase receptors, thus resulting insuppression of the corresponding ligand PDGF‑BB. Therefore, imatinib mesylate maybe considered a promising target therapy for the future treatment of breastcancer.DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.2018.3590 PMID: 29620139
