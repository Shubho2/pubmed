Current treatments such as chemotherapy are associated with several drawbacks that limit their effectiveness. Several anticancer remedies have beenfound with natural products in the past and the search continues for moreexamples. Cytotoxic natural compounds may have considerable benefits for cancertherapy either in potentiating the impact of chemotherapy or curtailment ofharmful effects. Therefore, discovery and identification of new drugs for breast and cervical cancer treatment are of high priority. The present study addressedthe potential role of the ALD (Aucklandia lappa Decne) in suppressingproliferation of T-47D, HeLa and HEp-2 cells in comparison with the non-cancerHCC1937 BL cell line. Treatment with an ALD extract of T-47D, HeLa, and HEp-2cells resulted in reduction in cell viability in MMT assays. Furthermore,lyophilized ALD principally suppressed cancer cell line growth and proliferation through induction of either intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic pathways asdemonstrated by significantly suppressed release of LDH, and NO production in adose-dependent manner, and activation of death receptors in T-47D and HeLa cells but not the HEp-2 cell line. Interestingly, lyophilized ALD significantly(p<0.005) repressed the growth of HEp-2 and T-47D cells after treatment for 48hrswhile 24hrs treatment significantly suppressed T-47D and HeLa cells. We reportfor the first time that lyophilized ALD selectively influences apoptosis through alternative apoptotic pathways in both breast and cervical human cancer cells.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.7.1917 PMID: 30051673
