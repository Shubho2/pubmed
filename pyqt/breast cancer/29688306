The Connectivity Map has beenwidely used to explore novel indications of existing drugs. However, theprediction accuracy of the existing methods, such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov statisticremains low. Here we present a novel high-performance drug repositioning approachthat improves over the state-of-the-art methods.Results: We first designed an expression weighted cosine method (EWCos) tominimize the influence of the uninformative expression changes and then developedan ensemble approach termed EMUDRA (Ensemble of Multiple Drug RepositioningApproaches) to integrate EWCos and three existing state-of-the-art methods.EMUDRA significantly outperformed individual drug repositioning methods whenapplied to simulated and independent evaluation datasets. We predicted usingEMUDRA and experimentally validated an antibiotic rifabutin as an inhibitor ofcell growth in triple negative breast cancer. EMUDRA can identify drugs that moreeffectively target disease gene signatures and will thus be a useful tool foridentifying novel therapies for complex diseases and predicting new indicationsfor existing drugs.Availability: The EMUDRA R package is available at doi:10.7303/syn11510888.Contact: bin.zhang@mssm.edu or zhangb@hotmail.com.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformaticsonline.DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty325 PMID: 29688306
