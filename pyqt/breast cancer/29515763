Both AgNPs-EPS matrices were tested by MTTassay for cytotoxic activity against human breast (SKBR3 and 8701-BC) and colon(HT-29, HCT 116 and Caco-2) cancer cell lines, revealing AgNPs-EPSaer as the mostactive, in terms of IC50, with a more pronounced efficacy against breast cancercell lines. Therefore, colony forming capability, morphological changes,generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induction of apoptosis andautophagy, inhibition of migratory and invasive capabilities and proteomicchanges were investigated using SKBR3 breast cancer cells with the aim toelucidate AgNPs-EPSaer mode of action. In particular, AgNPs-EPSaer induced asignificant decrease of cell motility and MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity and asignificant increase of ROS generation, which, in turn, supported cell deathmainly through autophagy and in a minor extend through apoptosis. Consistently,TEM micrographs and the determination of total silver in subcellular fractionsindicated that the Ag+ accumulated preferentially in mitochondria and in smaller concentrations in nucleus, where interact with DNA. Interestingly, theseevidences were confirmed by a differential proteomic analysis that highlightedimportant pathways involved in AgNPs-EPSaer toxicity, including endoplasmicreticulum stress, oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment triggering celldeath trough apoptosis and/or autophagy activation.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23859 PMCID: PMC5839394PMID: 29515763
