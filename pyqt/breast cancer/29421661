Due to itscentral role in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis, most research recentlyhas focused on its role associated with neurodegeneration disease, research onneuron and glial cell showed that pathological TDP-43 is associated with cellapoptosis which lead to loss of functional neurons and glial cells. However,little is known about its role on cancer cells, here we report a 35kD fragment ofTDP-43 also plays a key role in apoptosis of breast cancer cells, and may beserved as a potential therapeutic target to cure cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
