CD44 is a type I transmembrane glycoproteinthat regulates cell adhesion and cell-cell, as well as cell-extracellular matrix interactions. CD24 is expressed in benign and malignant solid tumors and is also involved in cell adhesion and metastasis. The aim of the present study was toinvestigate the effects of curcumin on the surface expression of CD44 and CD24 inbreast epithelial cell lines. An established breast cancer model derived from theMCF-10F cell line was used. The results revealed that curcumin decreased CD44 andCD24 gene and protein expression levels in MCF-10F (normal),Alpha5 (premalignant) and Tumor2 (malignant) cell lines compared with the levels in their counterpart control cells. Flow cytometry revealed that the CD44+/CD24+ cell subpopulation was greater than the CD44+/CD24- subpopulation in these three cell lines. Curcumin increased CD44+/CD24+ to a greater extent and decreasedCD44+/CD24- subpopulations in the normal MCF-10F and the pre-tumorigenic Alpha5cells, but had no significant effect on Tumor2 cells compared with thecorresponding control cells. Conversely, curcumin increased CD44 and decreasedCD24 gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and decreased CD44 geneexpression in MDA-MB-231 cell line, while CD24 was not present in these cells.Curcumin did not alter the CD44+/CD24+ or CD44+/CD24- subpopulations in the MCF-7cell line. However, it increased CD44+/CD24+ and decreased CD44+/CD24-subpopulations in MDA-MB-231 cells. In breast cancer specimens from patients,normal tissues were negative for CD44 and CD24 expression, while benign lesionswere positive for both markers, and malignant tissues were found to be negativefor CD44 and positive for CD24 in most cases. In conclusion, these resultsindicated that curcumin may be used to improve the proportion of CD44+/CD24+cells and decrease the proportion of CD44+/CD24- cells. Therefore, it may besuggested that curcumin decreased cancerous types of breast cells.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6386 PMID: 29693159
