Its adhesive properties areregulated by post-translational processing, such as tyrosine phosphorylation atsite Y685 in its cytoplasmic domain, and cleavage of its extracellular domain(sVE). In hormone-refractory metastatic breast cancer, we recently demonstratedthat sVE levels correlate to poor survival. In the present study, we determinewhether kidney cancer therapies had an effect on VE-cadherin structuralmodifications and their clinical interest to monitor patient outcome.METHODS: The effects of kidney cancer biotherapies were tested on an endothelial monolayer model mimicking the endothelium lining blood vessels and on a homotypicand heterotypic 3D cell model mimicking tumour growth. sVE was quantified byELISA in renal cell carcinoma patients initiating sunitinib (48 patients) orbevacizumab (83 patients) in the first-line metastatic setting (SUVEGIL andTORAVA trials).RESULTS: Human VE-cadherin is a direct target for sunitinib which inhibits itsVEGF-induced phosphorylation and cleavage on endothelial monolayer andendothelial cell migration in the 3D model. The tumour cell environment modulatesVE-cadherin functions through MMPs and VEGF. We demonstrate the presence ofsoluble VE-cadherin in the sera of mRCC patients (n = 131) which level atbaseline, is higher than in a healthy donor group (n = 96). Analysis of sVE levelafter 4 weeks of treatment showed that a decrease in sVE level discriminates the responders vs. non-responders to sunitinib, but not bevacizumab.CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the interest for the sVE bioassay in futurefollow-up of cancer patients treated with targeted therapies such astyrosine-kinase inhibitors.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0054-5 PMID: 29563634
