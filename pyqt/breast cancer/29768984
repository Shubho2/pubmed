[Epub ahead of print]Anti-cancer study and whey protein complexation of new lanthanum(III) complexwith the aim of achieving bioactive anticancer metal-based drugs.Shahraki S(1), Shiri F(1), Heidari Majd M(2), Dahmardeh S(2).Author information: (1)a Department of Chemistry , University of Zabol , P.O. Box 98615-538, Zabol , Iran.(2)b Faculty of Pharmacy , Zabol University of Medical Sciences , Zabol , Iran.In this study a new lanthanum (III)-amino acid complex utilizing cysteine hasbeen synthesized and characterized. The anticancer activities of the preparedLa(III) complex against MCF-7 cell lines were studied. Results of MTT assayshowed that at all three incubation times, the cytotoxic effect of preparedLa(III) complex on MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines displays a time- anddose-dependent inhibitory effects. The interactions of the La(III) complex withtwo whey proteins (bovine serum albumin, BSA, and Bovine β-lactoglobulin, βLG)have been explored by using spectroscopic and molecular dicking methods. Theobtained results indicated that La(III) complex strongly quenched thefluorescence of two carrier proteins in static quenching mode and also, BSA hahstronger binding affinity toward studied complex than βLG whit binding constantvalues of KBSA-La Complex ~ 0.11 ×104 M-1 and K βLG-La Complex ~ 0.63 ×103 M-1 at300 K. The thermodynamic parameters revealed the contribution of hydrogen bondand Vander Waals interactions in both systems. The distances of the La(III)complex whit whey proteins were calculated using Förster energy transfer theoryand proved existence of the energy transfer between two proteins and preparedLa(III) complex with a high probability. FT-IR and UV-Vis absorption measurementsindicated that the binding of the La(III) to BSA and βLG may induceconformational and micro-environmental changes of the proteins. The dockingresults indicate that the La(III) complex bind to residues located in the site IIof BSA and second site of βLG.DOI: 10.1080/07391102.2018.1476266 PMID: 29768984
