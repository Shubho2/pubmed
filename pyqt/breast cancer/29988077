Here weanalyzed 34 genes in 5131 suspected HBOC index cases by next-generationsequencing.METHODS: Using the Exome Aggregation Consortium data sets plus 571 individualsfrom the French Exome Project, we simulated the probability that an individualfrom the Exome Aggregation Consortium carries a PV and compared it to theestimated frequency within the HBOC population.RESULTS: Odds ratio conferred by PVs within BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, ATM, BRIP1, CHEK2, and MSH6 were estimated at 13.22 [10.01-17.22], 8.61[6.78-10.82], 8.22 [4.91-13.05], 4.54 [2.55-7.48], 5.23 [1.46-13.17], 3.20[2.14-4.53], 2.49 [1.42-3.97], 1.67 [1.18-2.27], and 2.50 [1.12-4.67],respectively. PVs within RAD51C, RAD51D, and BRIP1 were associated with ovariancancer family history (OR = 11.36 [5.78-19.59], 12.44 [2.94-33.30] and 3.82[1.66-7.11]). PALB2 PVs were associated with bilateral breast cancer (OR = 16.17 [5.48-34.10]) and BARD1 PVs with triple-negative breast cancer (OR = 11.27[3.37-25.01]). Burden tests performed in both patients and the French ExomeProject population confirmed the association of PVs of BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, andRAD51C with HBOC.CONCLUSION: Our results validate the integration of PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D in the diagnosis of HBOC and suggest that the other genes are involved in anoligogenic determinism.DOI: 10.1038/s41436-018-0005-9 PMID: 29988077
