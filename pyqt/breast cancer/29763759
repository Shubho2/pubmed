The current study consists ofclean and green synthesis of Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Phytoconstituents fromLongan (Euphorbia longana Lam.) fruit peel were used to reduce Ag+ into AgNPs.Different analytical techniques i.e. UV-vis Spectroscopy, X-ray diffractionspectroscopy (XRD), electron dispersive X-ray (EDX), High-resolution transmissionelectron microscopy (HRTEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)were used to analyze the synthesized AgNPs. AgNPs have localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak at 445 nm which is confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy. HRTEM showed that the prepared AgNPs are spheroid in shape and well dispersed while XRDresults showed that the AgNPs are face centered cubic crystalline. EDX confirmed the elemental composition of AgNPs. The antiproliferative response of AgNPs wasassayed by an exhaustive MTT assay. AgNPs showed potent anticancer activity (88%)against breast cancer cells MCF-7. Moreover, the green produced AgNPs effectivelyscavenged 91% of the stable and harmful 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)free radical which confirms its' efficient antioxidant nature. AgNPs haveprofound photocatalytic degradation (99%) of methylene blue in a short period of time (7 min). The noteworthy biological and photocatalytic responses of the greenand cleanly produced AgNPs are encountered to their well dispersion, petitevolume and round shaped structure.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
