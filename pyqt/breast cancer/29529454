However, potential implementation of this newparadigm could present considerable challenges which the present review aims toexplore.METHODS: Bibliographic databases were searched to identify studies evaluatingpotential implications of the implementation of personalised risk-based screeningand primary prevention for breast cancer. Identified themes were evaluated using thematic analysis.RESULTS: The search strategy identified 5699 unique publications, of which 59were selected for inclusion. Significant changes in policy and practice arewarranted. The organisation of breast cancer screening spans several healthcaredelivery systems and clinical settings. Feasibility of implementation depends on how healthcare is funded and arranged, and potentially varies between countries. Piloting risk assessment and prevention counselling in primary care settings has highlighted implications relating to the need for extensive additional trainingon risk (communication) and prevention, impact on workflow, and professionals'personal discomfort breaching the topic with women. Additionally, gaps in riskestimation, psychological, ethical and legal consequences will need to beaddressed.CONCLUSION: The present review identified considerable unresolved issues andchallenges. Potential implementation will require a more complex framework, inwhich a country's healthcare regulations, resources, and preferences related toscreening and prevention services are taken into account. However, with theinsights gained from the present overview, countries expecting to implementrisk-based screening and prevention can start to inventory and address the issuesthat were identified.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
