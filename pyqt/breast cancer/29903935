[Epubahead of print]O-linked mucin-type glycosylation in breast cancer.Burchell JM(1), Beatson R(2), Graham R(2), Taylor-Papadimitriou J(2),Tajadura-Ortega V(2).Author information: (1)Breast Cancer Biology, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King'sCollege London, Innovation Hub, Guy's Hospital London, London, U.K.joy.burchell@kcl.ac.uk.(2)Breast Cancer Biology, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King'sCollege London, Innovation Hub, Guy's Hospital London, London, U.K.Changes in mucin-type O-linked glycosylation are seen in over 90% of breastcancers where increased sialylation is often observed and a change from branched glycans to linear glycans is often seen. There are many mechanisms involvedincluding increased/altered expression of glycosyltransferases and relocalisationto the endoplasmic reticulum of the enzymes responsible for the addition of thefirst sugar, N-acetyl-d-galactosamine. It is now becoming clear that thesechanges can contribute to tumour growth and progression by modulating themicro-environment through glycan-sensing lectins expressed on immune cells, bymodulating interactions with tumour surface receptors and by binding toselectins. The understanding of how changes in mucin-type O-linked glycosylation influence tumour growth and progression reveals new potential targets fortherapeutic intervention in the treatment of breast cancer.Â© 2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BST20170483 PMID: 29903935
