This study aimsto investigate the positional reproducibility of heart edge (HE) and thoracicwall (TW) during repeated DIBHs.MATERIAL AND METHODS: At three occasions, 11 left-sided breast cancer patientswere CT imaged during 6 minutes of repeated DIBHs with 60 cine CT series. Theseries were evenly distributed over three bed positions and for each bedposition, the heart edge associated maximum heart distance (MHD) and thoracicwall-associated maximum lung distance (MLD) from a reference line wereretrospectively analyzed. The high temporal resolution of the CT series enabledintrinsic heart movements to be resolved from breath hold variations. A bodysurface laser scanning system continuously extracted the thorax height anddisplayed it in a pair of goggles for patient feedback. To check for'fake-breathing' movements, e.g. that the patient lifts its back from the couchto reach DIBH, the couch-to-spine distance was also measured in all CT series.RESULTS: The analysis was done for 1432 cine CTs captured during 292 breathholds. The DIBH moved the heart on average 15 mm in medial direction comparedwith free breathing. For the three bed positions studied, the mean value of themax range, across all patients, was between 11-13 mm for the MHD and 4-8 mm forthe MLD. The MHD variation due to breath hold variation was twice as large as theMHD variation due to intrinsic heart movement. The couch-to-spine distance variedless than 3 mm for all fractions, i.e., no fake-breathing was discovered.CONCLUSIONS: The heart edge and thoracic wall reproducibility was high inrelation to the medial heart displacement induced by the DIBH.DOI: 10.1080/0284186X.2018.1490027 PMID: 30074438
