Several techniques have been implemented to achieve a reproducible, fast and friendly treatment. The aim of the present study is to implement vDIBHusing the ExacTrac (BrainLAB AG, Germany) monitoring system.METHODS: Women with left-sided breast cancer, younger than 50 years or withcardiac disease, underwent whole breast RT with vDIBH using the ExacTrac(BrainLAB AG, Germany) monitoring system. Simulations were performed withpatients positioned supine on a breast board with both arms raised above thehead. Five optical markers were placed on the skin around the border of the left breast gland and their position was referenced with ink marking. Each patientreceived a training session to find the individual deep inspiration level.Finally, a vDIBH CT was taken. All patients were also studied in free breathing(FB) in order to compare the dose distribution for PTV, heart and left anteriordescending coronary artery (LAD). Pre-treatment verification was carried outthrough the ExacTrac (BrainLAB AG, Germany) system and verified with electronicportal imaging (EPI). Moreover, daily real time EPIs in during modality (capturedduring the beam delivery) were taken in order to check the reproducibility.RESULTS: 34 patients have been evaluated and 30 were eligible for vDIBH. Mostpatients showed small setup errors during the treatment course of below 5 mm in94.9% of the recorded fields. Mean Displacement was less in cranio-caudaldirection. Mean intra-fraction displacement was below 3 mm in all directions.vDIBH plans provided better cardiac dosimetry.CONCLUSIONS: vDIBH technique using ExacTrac (BrainLAB AG, Germany) monitoringsystem was applied with good reproducibility.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0195506 PMCID: PMC5945040PMID: 29746482  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
