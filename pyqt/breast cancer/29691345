Themammographers also reported that it took less than 1 minute to fill in thepatient information, and that they were willing to integrate MammoRisk into theirdaily practice.DISCUSSION: MammoRisk has several strengths as a risk-assessment tool, including that, when combined with complementary software, it incorporates breast densityand that patients must answer fewer questions than are required for otherrisk-assessment tools. The software also is easy and efficient for mammographers to use.CONCLUSION: The mammographers demonstrated that MammoRisk is an easy-to-usesoftware tool for breast cancer risk assessment, suggesting that it can beintegrated readily into routine clinical settings. MammoRisk also might assistthe radiologist in providing personalized screening recommendations because ofits ease of use and minimal effect on workflow. Future research is needed toevaluate whether other professionals will accept the use of MammoRisk in theclinical setting.Â© 2018 American Society of Radiologic Technologists.PMID: 29691345
