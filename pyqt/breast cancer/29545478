The carcinogenic potential of USP28 wasinvestigated in a comprehensive manner using patients, animal models, and cellculture. The findings demonstrate that overexpression of USP28 correlates with a better survival in patients with invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Mousexenograft experiments with USP28-deficient breast cancer cells also support this view. Furthermore, lack of USP28 promotes a more malignant state of breast cancercells, indicated by an epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition, elevatedproliferation, migration, and angiogenesis as well as a decreased adhesion. Inaddition to breast cancer, lack of USP28 in mice promoted an earlier onset and a more severe tumor formation in a chemical-induced liver cancer model.Mechanistically, the angio- and carcinogenic processes driven by the lack ofUSP28 appeared to be independent of HIF-1α, p53, and 53BP1.Implications: Thefindings of this study are not limited to one particular type of cancer but arerather applicable for carcinogenesis in a more general manner. The obtained data support the view that USP28 is involved in tumor suppression and has thepotential to be a prognostic marker.
