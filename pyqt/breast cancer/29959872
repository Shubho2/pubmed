[Epub aheadof print]Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 Polymorphic Variants Significantly AffectClearance of Tamoxifen and Clomiphene.Catucci G(1), Bortolussi S(1), Rampolla G(1), Cusumano D(1), Gilardi G(1),Sadeghi SJ(1).Author information: (1)Department of Life Sciences and Systems Biology, University of Torino, Torino,Italy.Human flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (hFMO3) is a drug-metabolising enzymethat oxygenates many drugs and xenobiotics in the liver. This enzyme is alsoknown to exhibit single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can alter the rates of monooxygenation of therapeutic agents. The purpose of this study was toinvestigate the effect of the three common polymorphic variants of hFMO3 (V257M, E158K and E308G) on the metabolism and clearance of three structurally similarcompounds: tamoxifen (breast cancer medication), clomiphene (infertilitymedication) and GSK5182 (antidiabetic lead molecule). For GSK5182, none of thethree variants showed any significant differences in its metabolism when comparedto the wild-type enzyme. In the case of clomiphene, two of the variants, V257Mand E308G, exhibited a significant increase in all the kinetic parametersmeasured with nearly two times faster clearance. Finally, for tamoxifen, a mixed behaviour was observed; E158K variant showed a significantly higher clearancecompared to the wild type, whereas V257M mutation had the opposite effect.Overall, the data obtained demonstrate that there is no direct correlationbetween the SNPs and the metabolism of these three hFMO3 substrates. Themetabolic capacity is both variant-dependent and substrate-dependent andtherefore when testing new drugs or administering already approved therapies,these differences should be taken into consideration.Â© 2018 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former NordicPharmacological Society).DOI: 10.1111/bcpt.13089 PMID: 29959872
