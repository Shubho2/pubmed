However, the significance of golgin-97 in human diseases such as cancer remains unclear.METHODS: We searched for a potential role of golgin-97 in cancers usingKaplan-Meier Plotter ( http://kmplot.com ) and Oncomine ( www.oncomine.org )datasets. Specific functions of golgin-97 in migration and invasion were examinedin golgin-97-knockdown and golgin-97-overexpressing cells. cDNA microarray,pathway analysis and qPCR were used to identify gene profiles regulated bygolgin-97. The role of golgin-97 in NF-κB signaling pathway was examined by usingsubcellular fractionation, luciferase reporter assay, western blot analysis andimmunofluorescence assay (IFA).RESULTS: We found that low expression of golgin-97 correlated with poor overallsurvival of cancer patients and was associated with invasiveness in breast cancercells. Golgin-97 knockdown promoted cell migration and invasion, whereasre-expression of golgin-97 restored the above phenotypes in breast cancer cells. Microarray and pathway analyses revealed that golgin-97 knockdown induced theexpression of several invasion-promoting genes that were transcriptionallyregulated by NF-κB p65. Mechanistically, golgin-97 knockdown significantlyreduced IκBα protein levels and activated NF-κB, whereas neither IκBα levels nor NF-κB activity was changed in TGN46- or GCC185-knockdown cells. Conversely,golgin-97 overexpression suppressed NF-κB activity and restored the levels ofIκBα in golgin-97-knockdown cells. Interestingly, the results of Golgi-disturbingagent treatment revealed that the loss of Golgi integrity was not involved in theNF-κB activation induced by golgin-97 knockdown. Moreover, both TGN-bound andcytosolic golgin-97 inhibited NF-κB activation, indicating that golgin-97functions as an NF-κB suppressor regardless of its subcellular localization.CONCLUSION: Our results collectively demonstrate a novel and suppressive role of golgin-97 in cancer invasiveness. We also provide a new avenue for exploring the relationship between the TGN, golgin-97 and NF-κB signaling in tumor progression.DOI: 10.1186/s12964-018-0230-5 PMCID: PMC5923015PMID: 29703230
