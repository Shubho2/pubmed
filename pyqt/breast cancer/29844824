China.E2Fs, as a family of pivotal transcription factors, have been implicated inmultiple biological functions in human cancer; however, the expression andprognostic significance of E2Fs in breast cancer remains unknown. In the present study, the mRNA expression patterns of E2Fs in breast cancer were investigatedwith Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas data. Prognostic values of E2Fs forpatients with breast cancer were determined using the Kaplan-Meier plotterdatabase. The results strongly indicated that E2F1, E2F2, E2F3, E2F5, E2F7 andE2F8 were overexpressed in patients with breast cancer, whereas E2F4 and E2F6exhibited no expression difference between patients with cancer and healthycontrols. In survival analyses, elevated E2F1, E2F3, E2F5, E2F7 and E2F8expression levels were significantly associated with lower overall survival,relapse-free survival (RFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) orpost-progression survival for patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, highexpression of E2F4 indicated improved RFS but reduced DMFS. Subgroup analysesbased on four clinicopathological factors further revealed that E2Fs wereassociated with the prognosis of patients with breast cancer in an estrogenreceptor-, progesterone receptor-, human epidermal growth factor 2- and lymphnode status-specific manner. These data indicated that E2Fs may serve aspromising biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8514 PMCID: PMC5958806PMID: 29844824
