Proxyphylline possessing 1-(10H-phenothiazin-10-yl)propan-2-yl (6) andpolybrominated benzimidazole (41) or benzotriazole moiety (42) remainedselectively cidal against Candida albicans (lg R ≥ 3 at conc. of 31, 36 and20 μM, respectively) however not against normal mammalian Vero cell line in vitro(IC50 ≥ 280 μM) and Galleria mellonella in vivo. These compounds also displayedmoderate antineoplastic activity against human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cellline (EC50 = 80 μM) and high against peripheral blood T lymphoblast (CCRF-CEM)(EC50 = 6.3-6.5 μM). In addition, 6 and 42 exerted: (1) dual activity againstfungal adhesion and damage mature biofilm; (2) necrosis of planktonic cells dueto loss of membrane function and of structural integrity; (3) biochemical(inhibition of sessile cell respiration) and morphological changes in cell wallpolysaccharide contents. Therefore, leading proxyphylline derivatives can beemployed to prevent cancer-associated biofilm Candida infections.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
