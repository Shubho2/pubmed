Electronic address: sunqiang_pumc@163.com.Although mammography (MG) has been widely used for breast cancer screening in thewestern world, over-diagnosis remains controversial. Milestone studies showedthat ultrasound (US) was an effective primary screening test for breast cancerboth in the western world and in China. US improves the sensitivity of screening in Chinese women who have denser breasts and develop breast cancer earlier thanCaucasian counterparts, and is used as the primary imaging test in thehospital-based opportunistic screening among asymptomatic self-referred women.Our previous work showed that US result might further differentiate theMG-detected breast cancers into low risk (US+) and ultra-low risk (US-). Indeed, most of the MG+/US- breast cancers would be ultra-low risk cancers and almostalways present as MG micro-calcifications. Furthermore, majority of the commonestMG+/US- abnormal finding of micro-calcification is usually benign. Biopsy ofbenign breast disease increases not only the risk of breast cancer, but theexpenses of screening and healthcare. Our hypothesis proposes thatmammography-positive ultrasound-negative (MG+/US-) asymptomaticmicro-calcifications might not need immediate invasive procedures and be safe to observe until the micro-calcifications increase significantly or becomeUS-positive. If this hypothesis is proved, US would serve as the primary imaging test for breast cancer screening in China, with MG as the selective screeningtest and diagnostic tool for surgical plan. Unnecessary biopsy or surgery mightbe avoided with screening expenses considerably decrease.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.mehy.2018.06.012 PMID: 30037622
