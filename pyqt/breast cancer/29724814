However, the role of AHNAK in lung tumordevelopment and progression remains unknown. Here, the Ahnak gene was disruptedto determine its effect on lung tumorigenesis and the mechanism by which ittriggers lung tumor development was investigated. First, AHNAK protein expressionwas determined to be decreased in human lung adenocarcinomas compared withmatched nonneoplastic lung tissues. Then, Ahnak -/- mice were used to investigatethe role of AHNAK in pulmonary tumorigenesis. Ahnak -/- mice showed increasedlung volume and thicker alveolar walls with type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. Most importantly, approximately 20% of aged Ahnak -/- mice developed lung tumors, and Ahnak -/- mice were more susceptible to urethane-induced pulmonary carcinogenesisthan wild-type mice. Mechanistically, Ahnak deficiency promotes the cell growthof lung epithelial cells by suppressing the TGFβ signaling pathway. In addition, increased numbers of M2-like alveolar macrophages (AM) were observed in Ahnak -/-lungs, and the depletion of AMs in Ahnak -/- lungs alleviated lung hyperplasticlesions, suggesting that M2-like AMs promoted the progression of lunghyperplastic lesions in Ahnak-null mice. Collectively, AHNAK suppresses type IIpneumocyte proliferation and inhibits tumor-promoting M2 alternative activationof macrophages in mouse lung tissue. These results suggest that AHNAK functionsas a novel tumor suppressor in lung cancer.Implications: The tumor suppressorfunction of AHNAK, in murine lungs, occurs by suppressing alveolar epithelialcell proliferation and modulating lung microenvironment.
