Methods: This prospectivestudy included 50 women with primary invasive, non-metastatic BC. The serum levelof 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D was measured by ELISA at diagnosis, before anycancer treatment. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH) D<20 ng/mL. Patientswere followed up for a median of 30 months (range: 18-48). Results: The medianlevel of 25(OH)D was 29.0 ng/mL (range: 10.0-55.0 ng/mL). Fifteen patients (30%) had vitamin D deficiency, which was positively associated with larger tumor size (p < 0.001), higher grade (p = 0.014), advanced stage (p = 0.001), lymph nodepositivity (p = 0.012), and HER2/neureceptor expression (p = 0.002). It was also linked with worse overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) (p =0.026, and p = 0.004, respectively). On multivariate analysis, DFS wasindependently affected by vitamin D deficiency with an HR of 2.8 (95% CI:1.6-7.0, p = 0.022) and advanced stage, i.e. stage II had worse survival comparedto stage I with an HR of 4.8 (95%CI: 1.1-21.7, p = 0.042). Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency had a negative effect on overall and disease-free survival in ourbreast cancer cases, being related to tumor size, stage, grade, nodal status and HER2/neu receptor expression.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.2.571 PMCID: PMC5980952PMID: 29481024
