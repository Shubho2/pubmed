All women who died from gynecologic, breast, lung, and colorectal cancerswere identified according to International Classification of Diseases, 10Revision, cause of death from 2003 to 2015. Regression analyses with ordinaryleast-squares linear probability modeling were used to test for differences inlocation of death over time, and differences in trends by cancer type, whilecontrolling for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, and education status.RESULTS: From 2003 to 2015, 2,133,056 women died from gynecologic, lung, breast, and colorectal malignancies in the United States. A total of 359,340 died fromgynecologic malignancies, including ovarian cancer (n=188,366 [52.4%]), uterinecancer (n=106,454 [29.6%]), cervical cancer (n=52,320 [14.6%]), and vulvar cancer(n=12,200 [3.4%]). Overall, 49.2% (n=176,657) of gynecologic cancer deathsoccurred at home or in hospice. The relative increase from 2003 to 2015 in therate of deaths at home or in hospice was 47.2% for gynecologic cancer deaths(40.5% in 2003 to 59.5% in 2015). In adjusted analyses, the trend in thepercentage of deaths at home or in hospice increased at a rate of 1.6 percentage points per year for gynecologic cancer deaths (95% CI 1.5-1.6) vs 1.5 (95% CI1.4-1.5, P<.001), 1.4 (95% CI 1.4-1.5, P<.001), and 1.5 (95% CI 1.4-1.5, P=.09)percentage points per year for lung, breast, and colorectal cancer deaths,respectively.CONCLUSION: Between 2003 and 2015, there was a 47.2% increase (40.5-59.5%) in therates of gynecologic cancer deaths occurring at home or in hospice. This trendmay represent an increase in advance care planning and value-based treatmentdecisions.DOI: 10.1097/AOG.0000000000002614 PMID: 29742673
