In this study, we constructed deformable torsophantoms that can be deformed to match the personal anatomy of Chinese male andfemale adults. The phantoms were created based on a training set of 79 trunkcomputed tomography (CT) images (41 males and 38 females) from normal Chinesesubjects. Major torso organs were segmented from the CT images, and thestatistical shape model (SSM) approach was used to learn the inter-subjectanatomical variations. To match the personal anatomy, the phantoms wereregistered to individual body surface scans or medical images using the activeshape model method. The constructed SSM demonstrated anatomical variations inbody height, fat quantity, respiratory status, organ geometry, male muscle size, and female breast size. The masses of the deformed phantom organs were consistentwith Chinese population organ mass ranges. To validate the performance ofpersonal anatomy modelling, the phantoms were registered to the body surface scanand CT images. The registration accuracy measured from 22 test CT images showed amedian Dice coefficient over 0.85, a median volume recovery coefficient (RCvlm ) between 0.85 and 1.1, and a median averaged surface distance (ASD) < 1.5 mm. Wehope these phantoms can serve as computational tools for personalized anatomymodelling for the research community.© 2018 Anatomical Society.DOI: 10.1111/joa.12815 PMID: 29663370
