Stage II-III BC patients withimplant-based immediate breast reconstruction received PMRT to the chest wall(CW) and to the infra/supraclavicular nodal region (NR) using a 15-fractionschedule (2.67 Gy/fraction) and helical IMRT (Tomotherapy® System, AccurayIncorporated, Sunnyvale, CA). A score was assigned to each treatment plan interms of planning target volume (PTV) coverage of CW and NR and the sparing ofthe organs at risk (OARs). The total score for each plan was calculated. Toxicitywas prospectively assessed according to validated scales. Data from 120consecutive patients treated in the period 2012-2015 were analysed with a median follow-up from the end of radiotherapy of 13.2 months (range 0.0-35 months).70.8% (85/120) of the plans had high total scores as a result of an optimalcoverage of both CW and RN and optimal sparing of all OARs. The maximum acutetoxicity was of grade 2 in 36.7% of the cases. Early late toxicity was mild inthe majority of cases. In the study population, helical tomotherapy-based IMRTproduced optimal treatment plans in most cases. Acute and late toxicity wasmild/moderate. Hypofractionated helical IMRT appears to be safe and feasible inthe moderate term for PMRT.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1095-6 PMID: 29442173
