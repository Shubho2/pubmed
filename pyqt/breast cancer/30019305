CPM with autologousreconstruction (AR) has major morbidity and resource implications.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the impact of PREDICT survivalestimates and lifetime CLBCR scores on decision making for CPM in patients withunilateral BC.METHODS: Of n = 272 consecutive patients undergoing mastectomy and AR, 252 wereincluded. Five- and 10-year survival was computed with the PREDICT(V2) onlineprognostication tool, using age and clinicopathological factors. Based on family history (FH) and tumor biology, CLBCR was calculated using validated BODICEAweb-based software. Survival scores were correlated against CLBCR estimates toidentify patients receiving CPM with 'low' CLBCR (< 30% lifetime risk) and poorprognosis (5-year survival < 80%). Patients with 'high' CLBCR receivingunilateral mastectomy (UM) were similarly identified (UK National Institute ofHealth and Care Excellence [NICE] criteria for CPM, ≥ 30% lifetime BC risk).Justifications motivating CPM were investigated.RESULTS: Of 252 patients, 215 had UM and 37 had bilateral mastectomy and AR. Only23 (62%) patients receiving CPM fulfilled the NICE criteria. Of 215 patients, 5(2.3%) failed to undergo CPM despite high CLBCR and good prognosis. CPMs wereperformed, at the patient's request, for no clear justification (n = 8),contralateral non-invasive disease, and/or FH (n = 5), FH alone (n = 4) andipsilateral cancer recurrence-related anxiety (n = 3).CONCLUSION: In the absence of prospective risk estimates of CLBCR and prognosis, certain patients receive CPM and reconstruction despite modest CLBCR, yet aproportion of patients with good prognoses and substantial risk are notundergoing CPM.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6593-4 PMID: 30019305
