The primary data source was the CancerResearch Network Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW). Sixteen potential indicators ofrecurrence were considered for model development. The final recurrence detection and timing models were determined, respectively, by maximizing the area under theROC curve (AUROC) and minimizing average absolute error. Detection and timingalgorithms were validated using VDW data in comparison with a gold standardrecurrence capture from a third site in which recurrences were validated through chart review. Performance of this algorithm, stratified by stage at diagnosis,was compared with other published algorithms. All statistical tests weretwo-sided.Results: Detection model AUROCs were 0.939 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.917 to 0.955) in the training data set (n = 3370) and 0.956 (95% CI = 0.944 to 0.971)and 0.900 (95% CI = 0.872 to 0.928), respectively, in the two validation datasets (n = 3370 and 3961, respectively). Timing models yielded average absoluteprediction errors of 12.6% (95% CI = 10.5% to 14.5%) in the training data and11.7% (95% CI = 9.9% to 13.5%) and 10.8% (95% CI = 9.6% to 12.2%) in thevalidation data sets, respectively, and were statistically significantly lower by12.6% (95% CI = 8.8% to 16.5%, P < .001) than those estimated using previouslyreported timing algorithms. Similar covariates were included in both detectionand timing algorithms but differed substantially from previous studies.Conclusions: Valid and reliable detection of recurrence using data derived fromelectronic medical records and insurance claims is feasible. These tools willenable extensive, novel research on quality, effectiveness, and outcomes forbreast cancer patients and those who develop recurrence.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djx200 PMCID: PMC5972574 [Available on 2018-10-05]PMID: 29873757
