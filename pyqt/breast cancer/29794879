Thismeta-analysis evaluates efficacy of PVB, compared with Control group, inpreventing CPSP after BCS, in light of the Initiative on Methods, Measurement,and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) recommendations. Electronicdatabases were searched for randomized trials comparing PVB with Control groupfor CPSP prevention after BCS. Eligible trials were assessed for adherence toIMMPACT recommendations. The primary outcomes were CPSP at 3 and 6 months,whereas secondary outcomes were PVB-related complications. Data were pooled andanalyzed using random-effects modelling. Trial sequential analysis was used toevaluate evidence conclusiveness. Data from 9 studies (604 patients) wereanalyzed. The median (range) of IMMPACT recommendations met in these trials was 9(5, 15) of 21. Paravertebral block was not different from Control group inpreventing CPSP at 3 months, but was protective at 6 months, with relative riskreduction (95% confidence interval) of 54% (0.24-0.88) (P = 0.02).Meta-regression suggested that the relative risk of CPSP was lower whensingle-injection (R = 1.00, P < 0.001) and multilevel (R = 0.71, P = 0.01) PVBwere used. Trial sequential analysis revealed that 6-month analysis wasunderpowered by at least 312 patients. Evidence quality was moderate according tothe GRADE system. Evidence suggests that multilevel single-injection PVB may beprotective against CPSP at 6 months after BCS, but methodological limitations arepresent. Larger trials observing IMMPACT recommendations are needed to confirmthis treatment effect and its magnitude.DOI: 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001292 PMID: 29794879
