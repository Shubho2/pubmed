This studyexamined the performance of 2 BC risk models that integrate clinical andhistologic findings in this population.METHODS: The BC risk at 5 and 10 years was estimated with the Breast CancerSurveillance Consortium (BCSC) and Benign Breast Disease to Breast Cancer(BBD-BC) models for women diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) at the Mayo Clinic from 1997 to 2001. Women with BBD were eligible for the BBD-BC model, but the BCSC model also required a screening mammogram. Calibration anddiscrimination were assessed.RESULTS: Fifty-six cases of BC were diagnosed among the 2142 women with BBD(median age, 50 years) within 5 years (118 were diagnosed within 10 years). TheBBD-BC model had slightly better calibration at 5 years (0.89; 95% confidenceinterval [CI], 0.71-1.21) versus 10 years (0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-1.00) but similardiscrimination in the 2 time periods: 0.68 (95% CI, 0.60-0.75) and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.60-0.71), respectively. In contrast, among the 1089 women with screeningmammograms (98 cases of BC within 10 years), the BCSC model had bettercalibration (0.94; 95% CI, 0.85-1.43) and discrimination (0.63; 95% CI,0.56-0.71) at 10 years versus 5 years (calibration, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.94-2.25;discrimination, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.46-0.71) where discrimination was not differentfrom chance.CONCLUSIONS: The BCSC and BBD-BC models were validated in the Mayo BBD cohort,although their performance differed by 5-year risk versus 10-year risk. Furtherenhancement of these models is needed to provide accurate BC risk estimates forwomen with BBD.
