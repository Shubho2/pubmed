[Epubahead of print]Randomized controlled clinical trial of polyethylene glycol recombinant humangranulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the treatment of neutropenia afterchemotherapy for breast cancer.Huang W(1), Liu J(1), Zeng Y(2), Wu F(1), Li N(1), Chen K(1), Hong Y(1), WangL(1), Zhen H(1), Lin L(1).Author information: (1)Department of Medical Oncology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian MedicalUniversity Cancer Hospital, The Teaching Hospital, Fujian University ofTraditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, 350014, Fujian, China.(2)Department of Surgical Oncology, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian MedicalUniversity Cancer Hospital, The Teaching Hospital, Fujian University ofTraditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou, 350014, Fujian, China.zeng_yi39@outlook.com.PURPOSE: To explore the efficacy and safety of daily administration ofrecombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), and a singlesubcutaneous injection of polyethylene glycol recombinant human granulocytecolony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF, a sustained-duration rhG-CSF) inneutropenia induced after chemotherapy.METHODS: Each patient received two cycles of chemotherapy. In the trial cycle,the patients received a single subcutaneous injection of PEG-rhG-CSF 100 µg/kg72 h after completion of chemotherapy; and in the control cycle, rhG-CSF5 µg/kg/day was subcutaneous injected once a day which began 72 h aftercompletion of chemotherapy for continued 14 days or until the absolute neutrophilcount (ANC) was ≥ 10.0 × 109/l twice. Therapeutic effect on primary endpoint was the incidence and duration of grade IV ANC neutropenia: comparing the incidenceand the mean time of duration of PEG-rhG-CSF with those of rhG-CSF under thecircumstance of ANC < 0.5 × 109/l. The immune populations evaluated included,CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells.RESULTS: After chemotherapy, comparing to PEG-rhG-CSF, the CD4/CD8 ratio(0.84 ± 0.19 vs.1.06 ± 0.25) and the number of NK cells of rhG-CSF group(12.18 ± 2.13 vs. 15.78 ± 2.57) decreased significantly. The number of NK cells(12.18 ± 2.13 vs. 13.78 ± 2.57) of rhG-CSF group after chemotherapy issignificantly less than that before chemotherapy, and the number of CD3+(54.31 ± 7.51 vs. 57.96 ± 5.55), CD4+ (26.28 ± 6.25 vs. 29.48 ± 6.44), CD8+(29.97 ± 6.47 vs. 31.68 ± 5.96) is lower than that before chemotherapy in rhG-CSFgroup, but the difference is not significant.CONCLUSION: The efficacy and side effects of a single subcutaneous injection ofPEG-rhG-CSF were similar to that of rhG-CSF multiple administrations. PEG-rhG-CSFmay have the effect of promoting immune function repairing.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3639-z PMID: 30043207
