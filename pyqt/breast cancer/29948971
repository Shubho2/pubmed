In particular, long-termassociations with overall cancer incidence and the potential interplay with otherlifestyle factors remain undetermined. In a population-based prospective cohort, 29,152 women aged 50-64 years at entry (1993-1997) were followed through 2013 forincidence of cancer (99% complete follow-up). Cox' proportional hazards modelswere used to estimate cancer incidence according to baseline HT alone and incombination with lifestyle factors including alcohol intake, BMI, physicalactivity, diet, and smoking. Among 5484 women diagnosed with cancer, baseline HT was associated with an overall higher risk of cancer (HR 1.28; 95%CI,1.21-1.36)-in particular, a higher risk of breast (HR 1.77; 95%CI, 1.61-1.95),ovarian (HR 1.68; 95%CI, 1.26-2.26), and endometrial (HR 1.86; 95%CI, 1.45-2.37) cancer. Combination with other lifestyle risk factors largely displayed additive associations. The risk of colorectal cancer was significantly lower (HR 0.79;95%CI, 0.66-0.95). However, in the interaction analysis, only "healthy" subgroupsof women using HT had a lower risk of colorectal cancer. With an overall higherrisk of cancer among women on HT, this study underlined the importance ofconsidering all female cancer risks in menopausal treatment guidelines. Thelargely additive associations between HT and the investigated lifestyle factorssupport the notion that high levels of hormones in itself play an importantetiological role in female reproductive cancers, whereas the possible protective impact in colorectal cancer might be limited to women with an otherwise healthylifestyle.DOI: 10.1007/s12672-018-0338-5 PMID: 29948971
