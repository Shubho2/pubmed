We first introducebehavioral risk and protective factors in follow-up care by presenting currentresearch outcomes modulating individual risk for recurrence. We argue thatalthough increased self-awareness is undoubtedly beneficial for BC survivors, it may also trigger adverse effects in vulnerable individuals such as overarousaland impaired emotional regulation. Indeed, research shows that many BC survivors are often confronted with clinical levels of fear of recurrence and anxiety anddepressive symptoms. Research on awareness about the impact of behavior on healthand fear of recurrence also offers interesting insights which can help to better understand non-compliant responses of BC survivors to medical recommendationsregarding lifestyle or screening in follow-up care. Given the high rate ofclinically relevant symptoms such as fear of recurrence and anxiety that may berelated to dysfunctional levels of self-monitoring, we review the effects of atherapeutic intervention called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) thatappears promising in reintegrating self-observation with patient well-being.DOI: 10.1159/000488716 PMCID: PMC5981773 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29887786
