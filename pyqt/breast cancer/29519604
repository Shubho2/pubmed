Theresulting looser state of chromatin DNA may increase the accessibility of DNAdrug targets and consequently improve the efficiency of anticancer drugstargeting DNA, such as Topo II inhibitors. A novel class of nucleoside-SAHAderivatives has been designed and synthesized based on the synergistic antitumor effects of topoisomerase II and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Their inhibitory activities toward histone deacetylases and Topo II, and their cytotoxicities incancer cell lines, were evaluated. Among the synthesized hybrid compounds,compound 16b showed the potent HDAC inhibitory activity at a low nanomolar level and exhibited antiproliferative activity toward cancer cell lines including MCF-7(breast), HCT-116 (colon), and DU-145 (prostate) cancer cells at a low micromolarlevel. Moreover, compound 16a showed HDAC6-selectivity 20-fold over HDAC1.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2018.02.042 PMID: 29519604
