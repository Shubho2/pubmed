Nobiletin is a flavonoid derived from citrus peel that has anticanceractivity. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) is a member of the class Bscavenger receptor family that is involved in importing fatty acids into cells.CD36 plays a role in tumor angiogenesis by binding to its ligand,thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), and then interacting with transforming growth factorbeta 1 (TGFβ1). CD36 is implicated in tumor metastasis through its roles in fattyacid metabolism. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlyingnobiletin's anticancer activity by characterizing its interactions with CD36 asthe target molecule. We hypothesize that the anti-angiogenic activity ofnobiletin involving its regulation of CD36 via signal transducer and activator oftranscription 3 (STAT3) rather than through TSP-1. Gene analysis identified aGamma interferon activation site (GAS) element in the CD36 gene promoter thatacts as a STAT3 binding site, an interaction that was confirmed by ChIP assay.STAT3 interacts with nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated Bcells (NF-κB), suggesting that nobiletin also acts through the CD36/(STAT3)/NF-κB signaling axis. Nobiletin inhibited CD36-dependent breast cancercell migration and invasion as well as CD36-mediated tumor sphere formation.Taken together, these results suggest that nobiletin inhibits cancer stem cellsin multiple ways.DOI: 10.3390/nu10060772 PMCID: PMC6024609PMID: 29914089
