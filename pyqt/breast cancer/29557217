SWE parameters including quantitativefactors [maximum elasticity (Emax), mean elasticity (Emean), elasticity ratio(Eratio) and standard deviation (SD)] and qualitative factor (color pattern) werecorrelated with clinicoradiologic and pathological features using univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses.RESULTS: Presence of symptoms and larger tumor size on ultrasound weresignificantly associated with higher Emax, Emean, Eratio, and SD (all p < 0.05)on univariate analysis. Older age was significantly correlated with higher Emaxand Emean (p = 0.026, 0.018). Lymphovascular invasion and larger pathologic size were significantly associated with higher Emax (p = 0.036, 0.043) and SD (p <0.001, 0.019). No immunohistochemical biomarkers were significantly correlatedwith SWE parameters. There was no significant correlation between color patternand any variable. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that thesymptom, tumor size on ultrasound and lymphovascular invasion were independentfactors that influenced the SWE values.CONCLUSION: Tumor stiffness as measured by SWE and B-mode ultrasound could helppredict cancer prognosis. Advances in knowledge: Clinicoradiologic factors hadcorrelation with quantitative and qualitative SWE parameters. Using SWEparameters and B-mode ultrasound, we can predict breast cancer prognosis.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20170830 PMID: 29557217  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
