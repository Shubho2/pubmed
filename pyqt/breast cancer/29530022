D.C is used mostly in some parts of the Asianregion by traditional practitioners to treat certain diseases associated withoxidative stress and inflammation including cancer and rheumatism. In Malaysia,it is popularly known as 'Mata Ayam' and local traditional practitioners believedthat the root of the plant is therapeutically beneficial.METHODS: The cytotoxic effect of hydromethanolic extract of A. crispa and itssolvents partitions (ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts) against breast cancercells were evaluated by using MTT assay. The cells were treated withconcentration of extracts ranging from 15.63 μg/mL- 1000 μg/mL for 72 h. Thequantification of phenolic and flavonoid contents of the extracts were carriedout to determine the relationship between of phytochemical compounds responsible for cytotoxic and antioxidative activities. The antioxidant capacity was measuredby DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging assay and expressed as milligram (mg)Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity per 1 g (g) of tested extract.RESULTS: The hydromethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts showed moderate cytotoxiceffect against MCF-7 with IC50 values of 57.35 ± 19.33 μg/mL, and54.98 ± 14.10 μg/mL, respectively but aqueous extract was inactive against MCF-7.For MDA-MB-231, hydromethanolic, ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts exhibitedweak cytotoxic effects against MDA-MB-231 with IC50 values more than 100 μg/mL.The plant revealed high total phenolic content, total flavonoid and antioxidantcapacity.CONCLUSION: The response of different type of breast cancer cell lines towards A.crispa extract and its partitions varied. Accordingly, hydromethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts appear to be more cytotoxic to oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer than oestrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer. However,aqueous extract appears to have poor activity to both types of breast cancer.Besides that, hydromethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts exhibit higher TPC, TFC and antioxidant capacity compared to aqueous extract. Synergistic effect ofanticancer and antioxidant bioactives compounds of A. crispa plausiblycontributed to the cytotoxic effects of the extract.DOI: 10.1186/s12906-018-2153-5 PMCID: PMC5848562PMID: 29530022  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
