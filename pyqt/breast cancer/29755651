However, their clinicalutility in guiding patients' treatment remains unknown. Here, we assessed whethermolecular profiling helps physicians in therapeutic decision making by analysing the molecular profiles of 1057 advanced cancer patient samples after failing atleast one standard of care treatment using a combination of next-generationsequencing (NGS), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and other specific tests. Theresulting information was interpreted and personalized treatments for eachpatient were suggested. Our data showed that NGS alone provided the oncologistwith useful information in 10-50% of cases (depending on cancer type), whereasthe addition of IHC/other tests increased extensively the usefulness of theinformation provided. Using internet surveys, we investigated how therapyrecommendations influenced treatment choice of the oncologist. For patients whowere still alive after the provision of the molecular information (76.8%), 60.4% of their oncologists followed report recommendations. Most treatment decisions(93.4%) were made based on the combination of NGS and IHC/other tests, and anapproved drug- rather than clinical trial enrolment- was the main treatmentchoice. Most common reasons given by physicians to explain the non-adherence torecommendations were drug availability and cost, which remain barriers topersonalised precision medicine. Finally, we observed that 27% of patientstreated with the suggested therapies had an overall survival > 12 months. Ourstudy demonstrates that the combination of NGS and IHC/other tests provides themost useful information in aiding treatment decisions by oncologists in routineclinical practice.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24757 PMCID: PMC5945513PMID: 29755651
