Epub 2018 Apr 10.Effect of resveratrol on doxorubicin resistance in breast neoplasm cells bymodulating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.Chen JM(1), Bai JY(2), Yang KX(1).Author information: (1)Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, The First People's Hospital ofYunnan Province, Kunming, Yunnan, 650032, China.(2)Department of Geriatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming MedicalUniversity, Kunming, Yunnan, 650032, China.In the study, we probed into the effect of Resveratrol (RES) on Doxorubicin(DOX)-resistant breast neoplasm cell line MCF-7/DOX as well as the mechanism ofRES underlying the DOX-resistant breast cancer. CCK-8 assay was utilized toassess the survival rates and sensitivity of breast neoplasm cell lines MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 to DOX and RES. DOX-resistant MCF-7 cell line was successfullycultivated with DOX dose increasing and was named MCF-7/DOX. Afterwards, woundhealing and Transwell assays were performed to measure the migration and invasioncapabilities of MCF-7/DOX cells, while cell propagation and apoptosis weredetermined by colony formation assay and flow cytometry analysis. Both westernblotting and immunohistochemistry were conducted to examine the expression ofproteins involved in PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Nude mice xenograft model wasconstructed to further verify the effects of DOX and RES on breast neoplasm invivo. RES restored DOX sensitivity in MCF-7/DOX cells, inhibiting biologicalfunctions of MCF-7/DOX cells and promoting cell apoptosis in vitro and impedingtumor growth in vivo. It was revealed by the mechanistic studies that MCF-7/DOXcells could regain the drug sensibility with RES treatment through inactivatingthe PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway. RES could reverse DOX resistance inbreast neoplasm cells and inhibited DOX-resistant breast cancer cell propagation and metastasis and facilitated cell apoptosis by modulating PI3K/Akt signalingpathway. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(6):491-500, 2018.© 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.DOI: 10.1002/iub.1749 PMID: 29637742
