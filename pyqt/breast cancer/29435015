China.The incidence of breast cancer has been increasing in China and the age of breastcancer onset is earlier compared with Western countries. Compounds commonly used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are an important source of anticancerdrugs. Ginseng is one of the most common medicines used in TCM. Ginsenosides,which are saponins found in the ginseng plant, are the major active componentsresponsible for the chemopreventive effects of ginseng in cancer. However, themechanisms by which ginsenosides exert their anticancer effects remain elusive.The current study combined tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantification withtitanium dioxide-based phosphopeptide enrichment to quantitatively analyze thechanges in phosphoproteomes in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells that occurfollowing treatment with the ginsenoside Rg3. A total of 5,140 phosphorylationsites on 2,041 phosphoproteins were quantified and it was demonstrated that thephosphorylation status of 13 sites were altered in MDA-MB-231 cells followingtreatment with Rg3. The perturbed phosphoproteins were: Cleavage andpolyadenylation specificity factor subunit 7, elongation factor 2 (EEF2),HIRA-interacting protein 3, melanoma-associated antigen D2, myosin phosphataseRho-interacting protein, probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MYCBP2, PRKCapoptosis WT1 regulator protein, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A, E3SUMO-protein ligase RanBP2, Septin-9, thymopoietin, and E3 UFM1-protein ligase 1.Western blotting confirmed that Rg3 increased the phosphorylation of EEF2 onThr57 but did not alter the protein expression of EEF2 in MDA-MB-231 and HCC1143 cells. These ginsenoside Rg3-regulated proteins are involved in variousbiological processes, including protein synthesis, cell division and theinhibition of nuclear factor-ÎºB signaling. The results of the present studyrevealed that Rg3 exerts its anticancer effects via a combination of differentsignaling pathways.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7654 PMCID: PMC5778838PMID: 29435015
