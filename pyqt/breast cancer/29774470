The reproducibility of scoring sTILs is variable with potentially excellentconcordance being achievable using a software tool. We examined agreement betweenbreast pathologists across Europe scoring sTILs on H&E-stained sections withoutsoftware, an approach that is easily applied in clinical practice. Theassociation between sTILs and response to anthracycline-taxane NACT was alsoexamined.METHODOLOGY: Pathologists from the European Working Group for Breast ScreeningPathology scored sTILs in 84 slides from 75 TNBCs using the immune-oncologybiomarker working group guidance in two circulations. There were 16 participants in the first and 19 in the second circulation.RESULTS: Moderate agreement was achieved for absolute sTILs scores (intraclasscorrelation coefficient (ICC) = 0.683, 95% CI 0.601-0.767, p-value < 0.001).Agreement was less when a 25% threshold was used (ICC 0.509, 95% CI 0.416-0.614, p-value < 0.001) and for lymphocyte predominant breast cancer (LPBC) (ICC 0.504, 95% CI 0.412-0.610, p-value < 0.001). Intra-observer agreement was strong forabsolute sTIL values (Spearman ρ = 0.727); fair for sTILs ≥ 25% (κ = 0.53) andfor LPBC (κ = 0.49), but poor for sTILs as 10% increments (κ = 0.24). Increasing sTILs was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of a pathologicalcomplete response (pCR) on multivariable analysis.CONCLUSION: Increasing sTILs in TNBCs improves the likelihood of a pCR. However, inter-observer agreement is such that H&E-based assessment is not sufficientlyreproducible for clinical application. Other methodologies should be explored,but may be at the cost of ease of application.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4825-8 PMID: 29774470
