Materials and Methods Inthis prospective cohort study, data from 37 185 women screened with DBT and SMand from 61 742 women screened with DM as part of a population-based screeningprogram in 2014 and 2015 were included. Early performance measures, includingrecall rate due to abnormal mammographic findings, rate of screen-detected breastcancer, positive predictive value of recall, positive predictive value of needle biopsy, histopathologic type, tumor size, tumor grade, lymph node involvement,hormonal status, Ki-67 level, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 statuswere compared in women who underwent DBT and SM screening and in those whounderwent DM screening by using χ2 tests, two-sample unpaired t tests, and tests of proportions. Results Recall rates were 3.4% for DBT and SM screening and 3.3% for DM screening (P = .563). DBT and SM screening showed a significantly higherrate of screen-detected cancer compared with DM screening (9.4 vs 6.1 cancers per1000 patients screened, respectively; P < .001). The rate of detection of tumors 10 mm or smaller was 3.2 per 1000 patients screened with DBT and SM and 1.8 per1000 patients screened with DM (P < .001), and the rate of grade 1 tumors was 3.3per 1000 patients screened with DBT and SM versus 1.4 per 1000 patients screened with DM (P < .001). On the basis of immunohistochemical analyses, rates of lymph node involvement and tumor subtypes did not differ between women who underwentDBT and SM screening and those who underwent DM screening. Conclusion DBT and SM screening increased the detection rate of histologically favorable tumorscompared with that attained with DM screening. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplementalmaterial is available for this article.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018171361 PMID: 29494322  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
