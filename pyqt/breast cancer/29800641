Electronic address: tongjunliu@163.com.Esophageal cancer is the eighth most prevalent cancer and has high mortality inour society. Isoalantolactone, extracted from Inula helenium L, has shown potent anticancer effects on a variety of cancers. However, its effect on humanesophageal cancer, and the underlying molecular mechanism, remain to beinvestigated. In the present study, we demonstrated that isoalantolactone inducedapoptosis in esophageal cancer cells. Treatment with isoalantolactone activatedcaspases-3, -7, and -10, and upregulated death receptor (DR)5. Furthermore, DR5knockdown partially reversed the effect of isoalantolactone. These resultsindicated the extrinsic apoptosis was induced by isoalantolactone. In addition,intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly elevated aftertreatment with isoalantolactone. N-Acetylcysteine, an ROS scavenger, blocked boththe apoptosis and decreased cell viability caused by isoalantolactone. In vivo,significant suppression of tumor growth by isoalantolactone was observed in anECA109 cell xenograft mouse model. Isoalantolactone showed no obvious adverseeffects on mouse weight and histology of heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney. In conclusion, our results revealed that isoalantolactone induced apoptosisthrough the extrinsic pathway via upregulation of DR5 and elevation of ROS inhuman esophageal cancer cells. Isoalantolactone, therefore, could be a potential candidate in developing anticancer agents for esophageal cancer patients.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
