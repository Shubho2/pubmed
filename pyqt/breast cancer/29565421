The risk of developingbreast cancer (BC) or epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in these women isuncertain. The study aimed to estimate risks of invasive BC and EOC in a largecohort of BRCA1/BRCA2 predictive test negatives.MethodsWe used cohort analysis toestimate incidences, cumulative risks, and standardized incidence ratios(SIRs).ResultsA total of 1,895 unaffected women were eligible for inclusion inthe BC risk analysis and 1,736 in the EOC risk analysis. There were 23 incidentinvasive BCs and 2 EOCs. The cumulative risk of invasive BC was 9.4% (95%confidence interval (CI) 5.9-15%) by age 85 years and the corresponding risk ofEOC was 0.6% (95% CI 0.2-2.6%). The SIR for invasive BC was 0.93 (95% CI0.62-1.40) in the overall cohort, 0.85 (95% CI 0.48-1.50) in noncarriers fromBRCA1 families, and 1.03 (95% CI 0.57-1.87) in noncarriers from BRCA2 families.The SIR for EOC was 0.79 (95% CI 0.20-3.17) in the overall cohort.ConclusionOurresults did not provide evidence for elevated risks of invasive BC or EOC inBRCA1/BRCA2 predictive test negatives.Genetics in Medicine advance onlinepublication, 22 March 2018; doi:10.1038/gim.2018.44.DOI: 10.1038/gim.2018.44 PMCID: PMC6033314 [Available on 2018-09-22]PMID: 29565421
