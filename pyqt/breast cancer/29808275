Ata.sadatshandiz@iauctb.ac.ir.The current experiment reveals the anticancer properties of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using aqueous leaf extract of Cichorium intybus, asignificant medicinal plant. The characteristics of AgNPs were continuouslystudied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infraredspectroscopy (FTIR), zeta potential, transmission electron microscopy (TEM),scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)analysis. Current microscopic results show that produced AgNPs were spherical in shape with an average size of 17.17 nm. A strong peak between 2 and 4 keV showed the greatest ratio of the elemental silver signals, due to surface plasmonresonance (SPR). The AgNPs, fabricated by green method, had a negative zetapotential of - 9.76 mV, which indicates that the synthesized AgNPs is dispersedin the medium with high stability. The in vitro cytotoxicity effect of AgNPsshowed promising anticancer activity against human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide assay, Hoechst 33258 staining, and upregulationof caspase 3 activity revealed significant apoptosis activities of AgNPs against MCF-7 cells. Moreover, the flow cytometric analyses of cell cycle distribution ofMCF7 cells showed that AgNPs treatment has enhanced the sub-G1 peaks, which is anindicator of apoptosis pathway. Overall results in our study suggested that AgNPsfabricated by a biogreen approach could be useful in cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s12011-018-1392-0 PMID: 29808275
