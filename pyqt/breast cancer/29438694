We investigated the chromatin recruitment, transcriptionalnetwork, and genetic vulnerabilities in breast cancer models harboring theclinically relevant ER mutations. These mutants exhibit both ligand-independentfunctions that mimic estradiol-bound wild-type ER as well as allele-specificneomorphic properties that promote a pro-metastatic phenotype. Analysis of thegenome-wide ER binding sites identified mutant ER unique recruitment mediatingthe allele-specific transcriptional program. Genetic screens identified genesthat are essential for the ligand-independent growth driven by the mutants. Thesestudies provide insights into the mechanism of endocrine therapy resistanceengendered by ER mutations and potential therapeutic targets.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
