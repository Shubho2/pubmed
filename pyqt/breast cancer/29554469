The model simulates individual life histories from birth todeath, with and without breast cancer, in the presence and in the absence ofscreening and treatment. Life histories are simulated according to discreteevents such as birth, tumor inception, the tumor's clinical diagnosis diameter inthe absence of screening, and death from breast cancer or death from othercauses. MISCAN-Fadia consists of 4 main components: demography, natural historyof breast cancer, screening, and treatment. Screening impact on the naturalhistory of breast cancer is assessed by simulating continuous tumor growth andthe "fatal diameter" concept. This concept implies that tumors diagnosed at asize that is between the screen detection threshold and the fatal diameter arecured, while tumors diagnosed at a diameter larger than the fatal tumor diameter metastasize and lead to breast cancer death. MISCAN-Fadia has been extended byincluding a different natural history for molecular subtypes based on a tumor'sestrogen receptor (ER) status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)status. In addition, personalized screening strategies that target women based ontheir risk such as breast density have been incorporated into the model. Thispersonalized approach to screening will continue to develop in light of potentialpolygenic risk stratification possibilities and new screening modalities.DOI: 10.1177/0272989X17711928 PMCID: PMC5862065 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29554469
