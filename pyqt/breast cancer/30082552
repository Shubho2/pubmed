The authors excluded patients who already underwent mastectomy or were given any chemotherapy/radiotherapy. They analyzed the clinical andimmunohistochemical characteristics using core biopsy specimens to determinetheir correlations with response to chemotherapy.RESULTS: A clinical complete response was observed in 19 patients (31.7%), aclinical partial response in 30 patients (50%), clinical stable disease in 8patients (13.3%), and progressive disease in 3 patients (5%). A pathologiccomplete response (pCR) was observed in 7 (21.87%) of 32 patients who underwentsurgery. High Ki-67 was associated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive status (P = 0.027) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (P = 0.006). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that pCR was correlated withHER2 status (odds ratio 26.589, confidence interval [CI] =1.606-44.190), P =0.022. Of the seven patients found to have pCR, six patients (85.7%) were treatedwith taxol-containing regimen. The other parameters that were correlated with pCRare TNBC and estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor status. Tumor size, Ki-67value, and grade of the tumor were not correlated with clinical response.CONCLUSION: Molecular subtype in breast cancer is an effective factor forpredicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. HER2-positive status wasassociated with high Ki-67 and high clinical and pathological response rate.Taxol needs to be added in neoadjuvant chemotherapy to improve pCR. Luminalsubtypes respond poorly to chemotherapy.DOI: 10.4103/ijc.IJC_238_17 PMID: 30082552
