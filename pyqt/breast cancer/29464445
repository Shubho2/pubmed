To overcome this limitation, we pooled data of fivepopulation-based case-control studies from Australia, Canada, France, Germany,and Spain into a single harmonized dataset using a common definition of nightwork including 6093 breast cancer cases and 6933 population controls. The oddsratio for breast cancer in women who ever worked at night for at least 3 hbetween midnight and 5 a.m. as compared to never night workers was 1.12 (95% CI1.00-1.25). Among pre-menopausal women, this odds ratio was 1.26 [1.06-1.51],increasing to 1.36 [1.07-1.74] for night shifts ≥ 10 h, 1.80 [1.20-2.71] forwork ≥ 3 nights/week, and 2.55 [1.03-6.30] for both duration of nightwork ≥ 10 years and exposure intensity ≥ 3 nights/week. Breast cancer risk inpre-menopausal women was higher in current or recent night workers (OR = 1.41[1.06-1.88]) than in those who had stopped night work more than 2 years ago.Breast cancer in post-menopausal women was not associated with night workwhatever the exposure metric. The increase in risk was restricted to ER+ tumors, particularly those who were both ER+ and HER2+ . These results support thehypothesis that night shift work increases the risk of breast cancer inpre-menopausal women, particularly those with high intensity and long duration ofexposure. Risk difference between pre- and post-menopausal women deserves furtherscrutiny.DOI: 10.1007/s10654-018-0368-x PMID: 29464445
