The primary aim of this study was toexplore how eye-tracking methods can be used to understand DCE respondents'decision-making strategies. A secondary aim was to explore if the presentationand communication of risk affected respondents' choices.METHOD: Two versions of a DCE were designed to understand the preferences offemale members of the public for breast screening that varied in how riskattributes were presented. Risk was communicated as either 1) percentages or 2)icon arrays and percentages. Eye-tracking equipment recorded eye movements 1000times a second. A debriefing survey collected sociodemographics and self-reportedattribute nonattendance (ANA) data. A heteroskedastic conditional logit modelanalyzed DCE data. Eye-tracking data on pupil size, direction of motion, andtotal visual attention (dwell time) to predefined areas of interest were analyzedusing ordinary least squares regressions.RESULTS: Forty women completed the DCE with eye-tracking. There was nostatistically significant difference in attention (fixations) to attributesbetween the risk communication formats. Respondents completing either version of the DCE with the alternatives presented in columns made more horizontal(left-right) saccades than vertical (up-down). Eye-tracking data confirmedself-reported ANA to the risk attributes with a 40% reduction in mean dwell time to the "probability of detecting a cancer" ( P = 0.001) and a 25% reduction tothe "risk of unnecessary follow-up" ( P = 0.008).CONCLUSION: This study is one of the first to show how eye-tracking can be usedto understand responses to a health care DCE and highlighted the potential impactof risk communication on respondents' decision-making strategies. The resultssuggested self-reported ANA to cost attributes may not be reliable.DOI: 10.1177/0272989X18782197 PMID: 30074879
