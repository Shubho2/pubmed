Currently, chemotherapy remains the main modality oftreatment for early-stage TNBC, as there is no approved targeted therapy for thissubtype. The biologic heterogeneity of TNBC has hindered the development andevaluation of novel agents, but recent advancements in subclassifying TNBC havepaved the way for further investigation of more effective systemic therapies,including cytotoxic and targeted agents. TNBC is enriched for germline BRCAmutation and for somatic deficiencies in homologous recombination DNA repair, theso-called "BRCAness" phenotype. Together, germline BRCA mutations and BRCAnessare promising biomarkers of susceptibility to DNA-damaging therapy. Variousinvestigational approaches are consequently being investigated in early-stageTNBC, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, platinum compounds, PI3K pathwayinhibitors, and androgen receptor inhibitors. Due to the biological diversityfound within TNBC, patient selection based on molecular biomarkers could aid the design of early-phase clinical trials, ultimately accelerating the clinicalapplication of effective new agents. TNBC is an aggressive breast cancer subtype,for which multiple targeted approaches will likely be required for patientoutcomes to be substantially improved.DOI: 10.1007/s11864-018-0539-8 PMID: 29656345
