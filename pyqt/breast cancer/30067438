To date, no predictive factors have been clearly correlatedwith long-term response to anti-HER2 agents.METHODS: 54 HER2+ MBC patients treated with HER2 targeted therapy as first linetreatment were analysed: 40 with a time to progression longer than 3 years inLong Responders (LR) group and 14 with a progression disease within one year ofanti-HER2 therapy in a control group named Early Progressors (EP). The expressionof 770 genes and 13 molecular pathways were evaluated using Nanostring PanCancer pathway panel performed on FFPE BC tissues.RESULTS: Considering baseline patients and tumor characteristics, EP women hadmore CNS spread and more metastatic burden of disease compared to LR (p > 0.05). Gene expression analysis identified 30 genes with significantly differentexpression in the two cohorts; five were driver genes (BRCA1, PDGFRA, AR, PHF6and MSH2). The majority of these genes were over-expressed, mainly in LRpatients, and encoded growth factors, pro- or anti-inflammatory interleukins and DNA repair factors. Only four genes were down regulated, all in EP group(TNFSF10, CACNG1, IL20RB and BRCA1). Most of these genes were involved in MAPKand PI3K pathways. MAPK pathway was differently expressed between LR and EP(p = 0.05). PI3K was the only pathway overexpressed in EP patients.CONCLUSIONS: Whole genome expression analysis comparing LR vs. EP identified agroup of genes that may predict more favourable long-term outcomes. Up-regulationof MAPK and down-regulation of PI3K pathway could be a positive predictivefactors. Further clinical implications are warranted.ABBREVIATIONS: BC: breast cancer; MBC: metastatic breast cancer; LR: longresponder; EP: early progressor; FFPE: formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded; CNS:central nervous system; PFS: progression free survival; OS: overall survival.DOI: 10.1080/15384047.2018.1480287 PMID: 30067438
