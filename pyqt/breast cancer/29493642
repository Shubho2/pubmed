Physicians, policy makers and patient associations agree on the needto inform women about the benefits and harms in order to permit an informeddecision. Decision aids (DA) are an effective way to support people in theirdecisions about health. This trial aims to assess women's informed choices,according to their health literacy and values, on participating or not in BCscreening for the first time. Benefits, harms and controversies are presented.The contents of the DA were developed on the basis of: a) findings of three focusgroups and four interviews, organized in the three Italian screening centers; b) analysis of the literature. A web-based platform (www.donnainformata-mammografia)was developed to implement the DA in a multilevel model. The impact of the DAwill be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial with a one week follow-up. Thewomen will be randomized to DA or a standard brochure via web. We will invite8160 women to obtain the final sample size of 816 women. The primary outcome willbe informed choice, measured via knowledge, attitudes and intentions on BCscreening.SECONDARY OUTCOMES: participation rate and decisional conflict process.If the informed choice will be reached, the web DA will be open source and could be implemented in BC screenings. This model could be applied to other health caresettings and cancer screenings.DOI: 10.1701/2865.28911 PMID: 29493642
