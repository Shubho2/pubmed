To date, it has been confirmed thatcathelicidin LL-37 and ceragenin CSA-13, both in free form and immobilized on thesurface of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP@LL-37, MNP@CSA-13) induce apoptosis incolon cancer cells. Nevertheless, the question remains whether ceragenins, assynthetic analogs of LL-37 peptide and mimicking a number of its properties, act as antineoplastic agents in breast cancer cells, where LL-37 peptide stimulatesoncogenesis. Considering potential anticancer activity, we determined whetherCSA-13 and MNP@CSA-13 might be effective against breast cancer cells. Our studyprovides evidence that both CSA-13 and MNP@CSA-13 decreased viability and inhibitproliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells despite the protumorigenic propertiesof LL-37 peptide. Flow cytometry-based analyses revealed that ceragenin treatmentresults in increases in dead and PI-negative/low-viability cells, which wasassociated with glutathione (GSH) depletion and increased reactive oxygen species(ROS) generation followed by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, caspaseactivation, and DNA fragmentation. These findings demonstrate that both CSA-13and MNP@CSA-13 cause disruption of the oxidative balance of cancer cells. Thisnovel mechanism of ceragenin-mediated eradication of cancer cells suggest thatthese agents may be developed as a possible treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25105 PMCID: PMC5955147PMID: 29774111
