China.Transcription factor MYB is essential for the tumorigenesis of multiple cancers, especially leukemia, breast cancer, colon cancer, adenoid cystic carcinoma andbrain cancer. Thus, MYB has been regarded as an attractive target for tumortherapy. However, pioneer studies of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against MYB,which were launched three decades ago in leukemia therapy, were discontinuedbecause of their unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. In recent years, the roles of MYB in tumor transformation have become increasingly clear. Moreover, theregulatory mechanisms of MYB, such as the vital effects of MYB co-regulators onMYB activity and of transcriptional elongation on MYB expression, have beenunveiled. These observations have underpinned novel approaches in inhibiting MYB.This review discusses the structure, function and regulation of MYB, focusing on recent insights into MYB-associated oncogenesis and how MYB-targeted therapeuticscan be explored. Additionally, the main MYB-targeted therapies, including novelgenetic therapy, RNA interference, microRNAs and low-molecular-weight compounds, which are especially promising inhibitors that target MYB co-regulators andtranscriptional elongation, are described, and their prospects are assessed.DOI: 10.7150/jca.23992 PMCID: PMC5907674PMID: 29675107
