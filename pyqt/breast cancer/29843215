A total of 688 breast cancer patients with digital mammography and complete molecular pathological results in TianjinMedical University Cancer Institute and Hospital between February 2015 andFebruary 2016 were collected. The DAS-density grade (DASD) and the radiologistsvisually classified density grade (RVD) were evaluated by 3 radiologists. Thecorrelation between density grade and the expression levels of ER, PR, Ki-67,p53, HER2 and breast cancer molecular subtype (PMS) were analyzed. The agreement between DASD and RVD was explored. ER, PR and HER-2 positive rate weresignificantly different among patients with different RVD grades (P< 0.05). HER2 positive rates showed an increasing trend following RVD upgrading (P𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑< 0.05).HER-2 positive rate in RVD D1 + D2 was 7.69%, which was higher than that in D3 + D4 (P< 0.05). The ER and Ki-67 expressions in patients were markedly differentamong DASD (P= 0.009 and 0.002) and RVD (P= 0.012 and 0.036) with differentgrades. The kappa value of each DASD to RVD was 0.31 (P< 0.01). The RVD 3proportion was 14.58% (63/432) in HER2 Over-expressing subtype, which wasapparently higher than RVD1 (2.43%, 1/41) (P< 0.05). Breast density may bepartial correlated with molecular pathology in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-181185 PMID: 29843215
