All this in turn leads us to evaluate thattumor biological behavior is not yet fully understood. Additionally, theheterogeneity of tumor cells represents a great biomedicine challenge in terms ofthe complex molecular-genetical-transcriptional and epigenetical-mechanisms,which have not been fully elucidated on human solid tumors. Recently, humanbreast cancer, but specifically TNBC is under basic and clinical-oncologyresearch in the discovery of new molecular biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets to improve treatment responses, as well as for seeking algorithms for patientstratification, seeking a positive impact in clinical-oncology outcomes and life quality on breast cancer patients. In this sense, important knowledge is emergingregarding several cancer molecular aberrations, including higher geneticmutational rates, LOH, CNV, chromosomal, and epigenetic alterations, as well astranscriptome aberrations in terms of the total gene-coding ribonucleic acids(RNAs), known as mRNAs, as well as non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences. In thisregard, novel investigation fields have included microRNAs (miRNAs), as well aslong ncRNAs (lncRNAs), which have been importantly related and are likelyinvolved in the induction, promotion, progression, and/or clinical therapeuticresponse trackers of TNBC. Based on this, in general terms according with thefive functional archetype classification, the lncRNAs may be involved in theregulation of several molecular mechanisms which include genetic expression,epigenetic, transcriptional, and/or post-transcriptional mechanisms, which arenowadays not totally understood. Here, we have reviewed the main dis-regulatedand functionally non- and well-characterized lncRNAs and their likelyinvolvement, from a molecular enrichment and mechanistic point of view, as tumor biomarkers for breast cancer and its specific histological subtype, TNBC. Inreference to the abovementioned, it has been described that some lncRNAexpression profiles correspond or are associated with the TNBC histologicalsubtype, potentially granting their use for TNBC malignant progression,diagnosis, tumor clinical stage, and likely therapy. Based on this, lncRNAs have been proposed as potential biomarkers which might represent potential predictive tools in the differentiated breast carcinomas versus TNBC malignant disease.Finally, elucidation of the specific or multi-functional archetypal of lncRNAs inbreast cancer and TNBC could be fundamental, as these molecularintermediary-regulator "lncRNAs" are widely involved in the genome expression,epigenome regulation, and transcriptional and post-transcriptional tumor biology,which in turn will probably represent a new prospect in clinical and/ortherapeutic molecular targets for the oncological management of breast carcinomasin general and also for TNBC patients.DOI: 10.1186/s13148-018-0514-z PMCID: PMC6020372PMID: 29983835
