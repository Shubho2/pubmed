Epub 2018 Apr26.12(S)-HETE induces lymph endothelial cell retraction in vitro by upregulation of SOX18.Fristiohady A(1), Milovanovic D(2), Krieger S(2), Huttary N(2), Nguyen CH(2),Basilio J(3), Jäger W(1), De Martin R(3), Krupitza G(2).Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Diagnostics, Faculty of Life Sciences,University of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.(2)Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.(3)Department of Vascular Biology and Thrombosis Research, Centre of BiomolecularMedicine and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.Metastasising breast cancer cells communicate with adjacent lymph endothelia,intravasate and disseminate through lymphatic routes, colonise lymph nodes andfinally metastasize to distant organs. Thus, understanding and blockingintravasation may attenuate the metastatic cascade at an early step. As a triggerfactor, which causes the retraction of lymph endothelial cells (LECs) and opensentry ports for tumour cell intravasation, MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells secrete the pro-metastatic arachidonic acid metabolite,12S-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid [12(S)-HETE]. In the currentstudy, treatment of LECs with 12(S)-HETE upregulated the expression of thetranscription factors SRY-related HMG-box 18 (SOX18) and prospero homeoboxprotein 1 (PROX1), which determine endothelial development. Thus, whether theyhave a role in LEC retraction was determined using a validated intravasationassay, small interfering RNA mediated knockdown of gene expression, and mRNA and protein expression analyses. Specific inhibition of SOX18 or PROX1 significantly attenuated in vitro intravasation of MDA-MB231 spheroids through the LEC barrier and 12(S)-HETE-triggered signals were transduced by the high and low affinityreceptors, 12(S)-HETE receptor and leukotriene B4 receptor 2. In addition, thecurrent findings indicate that there is crosstalk between SOX18 and nuclearfactor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, which was demonstrated tocontribute to MDA-MB231/lymph endothelial intravasation. The present datademonstrate that the endothelial-specific and lymph endothelial-specifictranscription factors SOX18 and PROX1 contribute to LEC retraction.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4378 PMID: 29749465
