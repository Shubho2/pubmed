Emerging data have shown that DBT increases breast cancer (BC) detection and reduces recall in BC screening programs. Studies have also suggested that DBTimproves assessment of screen-recalled findings. Areas covered: Studies of DBTfor population BC screening and those for assessment of screen-detected findings were reviewed to provide an up-to-date summary of the evidence on DBT in thescreening setting. A systematic literature search was conducted for each of thetopics; study-specific information and/or quantitative data on detection oraccuracy were extracted and collated in tables. Expert commentary: The evidenceon DBT for BC screening reinforces that DBT integrated with DM increases cancerdetection rates compared to DM alone, although the extent of improved detectionvaried between studies. The effect of DBT on recall rates was heterogeneous with substantial reductions evident noticeably in retrospective comparative studies.The evidence on DBT for workup was sparse and those studies had limitationsrelated to design and methods. Even though the majority showed improvedspecificity using DBT compared with conventional imaging, there was littleevidence on how DBT impacts assessment outcomes.DOI: 10.1080/14737140.2018.1483243 PMID: 29847744
