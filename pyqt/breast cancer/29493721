Elastography is a novel ultrasound technique that has beendemonstrated to be effective clinically in detecting tissue pathology in areassuch as the liver and breast. Preliminary data suggest that it may be effectivein screening tissues in the neck for malignancy, specifically cervical lymphnodes. However, diagnostic criteria and elastographic techniques varysignificantly among the studies we have reviewed, which all tend to focus onpopulations of patients with many different types of primary malignancies.Further research is required on the feasibility of creating standardized andreproducible clinical criteria in a specific patient population. To study theclinical utility of elastography in cervical lymph nodes, patients with diagnosedpapillary thyroid carcinoma may serve as an ideal population because of theirneed for ultrasound surveillance and the propensity of papillary thyroid cancerto metastasize to and recur in cervical lymph nodes. We will review thelimitations, techniques, and reported clinical utility of elastography oncervical lymph nodes and its potential as a screening modality for papillarythyroid cancer.PMID: 29493721
