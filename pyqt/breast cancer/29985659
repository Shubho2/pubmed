Nevertheless, we havelittle knowledge on the long-term consequences of chemotherapy and the effects ofhospitalization. In the present study, we employed the two-factorrepeated-measure cross-sectional design to determine the effects of chemotherapy and hospitalization on rest-activity (RA) rhythm and QoL of breast cancerpatients. Initially, we randomly selected 39 inpatients and 42 outpatients,scheduled to receive six cycles of chemotherapy, from the Regional Cancer Center (RCC), Raipur, India. Finally, 30 patients in each group were included in thecurrent study. We monitored circadian RA rhythm and QoL using wrist actigraphyand QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23, respectively, during the 1st (C1), 3rd (C3) and 6th(C6) chemotherapy cycles. Results revealed that with the progression ofchemotherapy cycles (from C1 to C6), all rhythm parameters, namely mesor,amplitude, acrophase, rhythm quotient (RQ), circadian quotient (CQ), peakactivity (PA), dichotomy index and autocorrelation coefficient, significantlydecreased in both cancer in- and outpatients. In both groups of patients andduring C1-C6, all functional and global QoL measures of QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23significantly decreased and the symptoms significantly increased, exceptconstipation, body image, sexual functioning and future perspectives inoutpatients. The hospitalization exacerbated the problems associated with the RA rhythm and the QoL of the patients. In conclusion, the current study highlighted the negative consequences of hospitalization among inpatients, irrespective ofthe stage of cancer. We, therefore, recommend that cancer patients should beadministered with chemotherapy as outpatients. The proposed protocol might have acovert bearing on the expression of better physiological state leading tosatisfactory treatment outcomes.DOI: 10.1080/07420528.2018.1493596 PMID: 29985659
