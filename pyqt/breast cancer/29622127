Electronic address: ecohen@mdanderson.org.(2)Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Division of Diagnostic Imaging, TheUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit1350, Houston, TX 77030-4009, USA.Breast MR imaging is commonly used for high-risk screening and for assessing the extent of disease in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, but its utilityfor assessing suspicious symptoms and equivocal imaging findings is less widelyaccepted. The authors review current literature and guidelines regarding the use of breast MR imaging for these indications. Overall, problem-solving breast MRimaging is best reserved for pathologic nipple discharge and sonographicallyoccult architectural distortion with limited biopsy options. Further study isnecessary to define the role of problem-solving MR imaging for calcifications,mammographic asymmetries, and surgical scarring.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.
