Electronic address: sanyogjain@niper.ac.in.The present report deals with conjugation of dual drug; docetaxel (DTX) andgemcitabine (GEM) with linker poly-ethylene-glycol (PEG) to develop amphiphilicmolecule having self-assembled property. The synthesized conjugate (DTX-PEG-GEM) demonstrated critical micelle concentration (CMC) in the range of 5-10 μg/mlwhich self-assembled to form NPs with size 124.2 ± 5.7. Remarkably highercoumarin-6 (C-6) fluorescence signals observed in case of C-6 loaded NPs,suggested enhanced cellular uptake via clathrin mediated endocytosis. DevelopedNPs demonstrated 4.8-fold higher AUC(0-∞) value of GEM in comparison withGemzar®. Tumor growth inhibition study demonstrated significant reduction intumor volume and higher survival rate with NPs. Moreover, NPs demonstratedsignificantly lower hepato- and nephro-toxicity, evident from bothhistopathological sections and biochemical markers level estimation, andhemolytic toxicity. Data in hand suggest enhanced therapeutic efficacy andreduced toxicity of developed NPs over conventional drugs, resulting in efficientcombinatorial chemotherapeutic-regimen and patient compliance, which is still an unmet task.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
