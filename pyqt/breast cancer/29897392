Underrepresentation of obese patients inobesity-related cancer randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may affectgeneralizability of results. We aimed to assess the reporting of informationabout eligibility and enrollment of obese participants in obesity-related cancer RCTs.Methods: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs of 10 obesity-related cancertypes (esophagus, colon/rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, postmenopausalbreast, endometrium, ovary, kidney, and thyroid cancer). We selected RCTspublished between 2013 and 2016 in five major journals. For each trial, weexamined the article, the protocol, and the registration record. We assessed ifeligibility criteria limiting the enrollment of obese participants were reported,the proportion of obese participants that were enrolled, and if a subgroupanalysis according to obesity status was reported. We systematically contactedcorresponding authors and asked for information about eligibility of obeseparticipants and the proportion of obese participants.Results: We included 76 RCTs. Colon/rectum (n = 20), postmenopausal breast(n = 11), and kidney (n = 11) cancers were the most frequent types. Based onpublicly available sources, information on the eligibility of obese participants was available in 5 (7%) trials. The proportion of obese participants could beestimated in 9 (12%) trials only. We found a subgroup analysis in only one RCT.When considering unpublished information, the eligibility of obese participantswas explicitly stated in 31 (41%) trials but it was unclear if the remaining 59% trials considered obese participants as eligible and what proportion of obeseparticipants was included. Across 22 trials, the median proportion of obeseparticipants included was 18% (Q1-Q3 11-23).Conclusion: Information on the eligibility and enrollment of obese participantsin cancer RCTs is dramatically underreported. More transparency is needed tounderstand the applicability of obesity-related cancer RCT results to obesepatients with cancer.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy138 PMID: 29897392
