In thisstudy, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the prognostic value of these two markers in breast cancer patients.Methods: After electronic databases were searched, 36 studies (31 includinginformation regarding CA15-3 and 23 including information regarding CEA) with12,993 subjects were included. Based on the data directly or indirectly from the available studies, the hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) and their 95%confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled according to higher or lower markerlevels.Results: Elevated CA15-3 or CEA was statistically significant with poorer DFS andOS in breast cancer (multivariate analysis of OS: HR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.76-2.33 forCA15-3; HR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.46-2.20 for CEA; multivariate analysis of DFS:HR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.06-1.55 for CA15-3; HR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.53-2.04 for CEA).Subgroup analysis showed that CA15-3 or CEA had significant predictive values in primary or metastasis types and different cut-offs and included sample sizes and even the study publication year. Furthermore, elevated CA15-3 was associated withadvanced histological grade and younger age, while elevated CEA was related tothe non-triple-negative tumor type and older age. These two elevated markers wereall associated with a higher tumor burden.Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed that elevated serum CA15-3 or CEA wasassociated with poor DFS and OS in patients with breast cancer, and they shouldbe tested anytime if possible.DOI: 10.1155/2018/9863092 PMCID: PMC5954898PMID: 29854028
