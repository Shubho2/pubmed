IKKβ ishighly expressed in invasive breast tumours and its level of expression washigher in patients with bone metastasis. IKKβ overexpression in parentalMDA-MD-231 breast cancer cells, promoted mammary tumour growth but failed toconvey osteolytic potential to these cells in mice. In contrast, IKKβoverexpression in osteotropic sub-clones of MDA-MB-231 cells with differingosteolytic phenotypes increased incidence of bone metastasis, exacerbatedosteolysis and enhanced skeletal tumour growth, whereas its knockdown wasinhibitory. Functional and mechanistic studies revealed that IKKβ enhanced theability of osteotropic MDA-MB-231 cells to migrate, increase osteoclastogenesis, and to inhibit osteoblast differentiation via a mechanism mediated, at least inpart, by cytoplasmic sequestering of FoxO3a and VEGFA production. Thus,tumour-selective manipulation of IKKβ and its interaction with FoxO3a mayrepresent a novel strategy to reduce the development of secondary breast cancerin the skeleton.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24743 PMCID: PMC5882323PMID: 29662632
