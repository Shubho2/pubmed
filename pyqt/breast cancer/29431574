Materials and Methods Of 40 patients with breast cancer whoparticipated in a longitudinal study between June 2011 and March 2016, 34completed the study. There were 13 patients who obtained a pathologic completeresponse (pCR) and 21 patients who did not obtain a pCR. Imaging data from sixsubjects were excluded from the study because either the patients dropped out of the study before it was finished or there was an instrumentation malfunction. Twoweeks into the treatment regimen, three-dimensional images of both breasts duringa breath hold were acquired by using dynamic diffuse optical tomography. Featuresfrom the breath-hold traces were used to distinguish between response groups.Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and sensitivity analysis were usedto determine the degree of association with 5-month treatment outcome. Results AnROC curve analysis showed that this method could identify patients with a pCRwith a positive predictive value of 70.6% (12 of 17), a negative predictive valueof 94.1% (16 of 17), a sensitivity of 92.3% (12 of 13), a specificity of 76.2%(16 of 21), and an area under the ROC curve of 0.85. Conclusion Several dynamicoptical imaging features obtained within 2 weeks of NAC initiation wereidentified that showed statistically significant differences between patientswith pCR and patients without pCR as determined 5 months after treatmentinitiation. If confirmed in a larger cohort prospective study, these dynamicimaging features may be used to predict treatment outcome as early as 2 weeksafter treatment initiation. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material isavailable for this article.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018161041 PMCID: PMC5978455 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29431574  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
