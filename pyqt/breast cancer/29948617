[Epub ahead ofprint]The Histone Acetylation Modifications of Breast Cancer and their TherapeuticImplications.Guo P(1), Chen W(1), Li H(1), Li M(1), Li L(2).Author information: (1)The Key Laboratory of Pathobiology, Ministry of Education, Norman BethuneMedical College, Jilin University, Changchun, 130021, China.(2)The Key Laboratory of Pathobiology, Ministry of Education, Norman BethuneMedical College, Jilin University, Changchun, 130021, China. 43973966@qq.com.The histone acetylation modifications (HAMs) influence a large number of cellularfunctions. They are mediated through histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). Nowadays, people have realized that HAMs are crucial fordevelopment and prognosis of breast cancer. Investigations about abnormal HAMs inbreast cancer focus on initiating molecular mechanisms in breast cancerdevelopment, identification of new biomarkers to predict breast canceraggressiveness and the therapeutic potential. As HAMs are reversible, breastcancer may be treated by restoring HAMs to normal levels. Indeed, some HDACinhibitors have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treatcertain cancers. Furthermore, HAT inhibitors, HAT activators and HDAC activators may also be used as drugs to treat breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s12253-018-0433-5 PMID: 29948617
