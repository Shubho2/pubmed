Historically, patientsreceiving post mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) were not candidates forimmediate autologous reconstruction due to concerns for flap volume depletion,fat necrosis, and flap failure. However, this literature is anecdotal and lackscase controls. We objectively analyzed the effects radiation imparts on immediateDIEP flap reconstruction using 3-dimensional software and inherent controls.METHODS: We performed a cohort study on breast cancer patients who underwentimmediate bilateral DIEP flap reconstructions followed by PMRT between 2005 and2014. Exclusion criteria included patients less than 6 months from PMRTcompletion and bilateral PMRT. Three-dimensional photographs were analyzed using Geomagic (Rock Hill, SC) software to compare flap position, projection, andvolume between the irradiated and nonirradiated reconstructed breasts. Breast Qsurvey evaluated patients' satisfaction.RESULTS: Eleven patients met inclusion criteria. Average time from PMRTcompletion to photo acquisition was 1.93 years. There was no statisticaldifference in average volume or projection in the irradiated versus nonirradiatedside (P = 0.087 and P = 0.176, respectively). However, position of the irradiatedflaps was significantly higher on the chest wall compared to controls (meandifference, 1.325 cm; P < 0.004).CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional analysis exhibited no statistical differences inprojection or volume between irradiated DIEP flaps and nonirradiated controls.However, irradiated DIEP flaps were positioned higher on the chest wall, similar to observations in irradiated tissue expanders/implants. Patients were satisfied as measured by Breast Q. Immediate bilateral DIEP flap reconstructions can safelybe performed with PMRT with satisfactory results.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001462 PMID: 29794501
