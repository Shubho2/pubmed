[Epub ahead ofprint]Design and Investigation of Core/Shell GQDs/hMSN Nanoparticles as an EnhancedDrug Delivery Platform in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.Yang D, Yao X, Dong J, Wang N, Du Y, Sun S(1), Gao L(2), Zhong Y, Qian C, HongH(3).Author information: (1)Xuzhou Air Force College , Xuzhou , Jiangsu 221000 , China.(2)Xuzhou Cancer Hospital , Xuzhou , Jiangsu 221000 , China.(3)Department of Radiology , University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan48109-2200 , United States.Due to the excellent photoluminescent properties and singlet oxygen (1O2)generating efficiency, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with maximal emission innear-infrared region (NIR) exhibited great potential in cancer imaging andtherapy. However, GQDs can be cleared quickly via the renal system in vivobecause of their ultrasmall size, which leads to the compromised cancer cellkilling efficacy. Here, we report a hybrid nanoplatform, where GQDs wereincorporated into the cavity of hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (hMSN) to form GQDs@hMSN-PEG nanoparticles (NPs). Optical characterization indicated thatGQDs@hMSN-PEG NPs still maintained good absorption and emission properties fromGQDs, and the composite NPs still possessed similar 1O2 generating efficiency.GQDs@hMSN-PEG NPs exhibited good biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo. Highcargo-loading efficiency was achieved for doxorubicin (DOX), and the formedGQDs@hMSN(DOX)-PEG NPs showed the feasibility of tumor-oriented drug delivery.The extended retention time in tumor and good drug loading efficacy confirmedthat GQDs@hMSN-PEG could serve as one promising candidate for combinationalcancer treatment where photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy modules can beintegrated into one system.DOI: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00399 PMID: 30011184
