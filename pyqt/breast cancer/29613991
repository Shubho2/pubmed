Furthermore, the ability of the ductal relationpattern in differentiating benign and malignant lesions was explored.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Magnetic resonance imaging and US findings of 56 patients who had a pathologic diagnosis of papillary lesion were examined. Ductal findingswere classified into four types for both imaging methods: intraductal form,extraductal form, mixed form, and no ductal relation. The correlation between MRIand US was then analyzed with respect to ductal findings. Statistical analyseswere performed to determine the value of ductal patterns determined by these 2imaging methods in the differentiation of benign and malignant papillary lesions.RESULTS: A total of 56 cases with papillomatosis (n = 11), papillomas (n = 29),and papillary breast carcinomas (n = 16) were included. There was a statisticallysignificant correlation between all ductal patterns on US and the correspondingductal signs on MRI. Palpable masses were statistically more common in patientswith papillary breast carcinoma compared with other groups (P < 0.01). Segmental contrast enhancement occurred at a significantly higher rate in papillary breast carcinoma and papillomatosis patients, as compared with papilloma patients (P <0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Actual resolution of MRI is close to that of US in terms of theability to demonstrate the ductal relation of masses. Segmental contrastenhancement on MRI and nonmass-like heterogeneous hypoechoic area or mass withmultiple ductal extensions on US can be used in discriminating benign versusmalignant papillary lesions. The absence of ductal sign in MRI indicatesbenignity.DOI: 10.1097/RCT.0000000000000739 PMID: 29613991  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
