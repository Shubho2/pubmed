DOX/TAX treatment could ameliorate the elevated energy and nucleotidesdemands in some organs while mPEG-PLGA-DT treatment showed outstandingtherapeutic outcomes in restoring the metabolic phenotypes of serum and kidneyfrom tumor-bearing mice to the healthy state.CONCLUSION: This investigation proved the biological advantages of mPEG-PLGA-DTover DOX/TAX in molecular level through the comparison between their metabolicresponses in vivo.DOI: 10.2217/nnm-2017-0363 PMID: 29527969
