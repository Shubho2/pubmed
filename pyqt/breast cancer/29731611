The objective of this evaluationis to examine the association between participant self-reported adherence to the study supplements and changes in plasma biomarker levels.Patients and methods: Correlation coefficients quantified the association betweenchanges in alpha-tocopherol and CoQ10 levels and the association betweenself-reported adherence and changes in biomarkers. Participants were categorized by self-reported adherence; Kruskal- Wallis tests compared changes inalpha-tocopherol and CoQ10 levels between self-reported adherence groups.Results: Women (N=155) provided baseline and post-treatment biomarkers; 147completed at least one diary. While changes in alpha-tocopherol and CoQ10 levels were moderately correlated, correlations ranged from 0.40 to 0.48, associationbetween self-reported adherence and plasma alpha-tocopherol or CoQ10 levels wasweak; correlations ranged from 0.10 to 0.29 at weeks 8, 16, and 24. Someparticipants with high self-reported adherence actually had decreases in theirbiomarker levels.Conclusion: These findings support that self-reported adherence is likely to beoverestimated. Biological and other measures of adherence that can betteridentify true adherence to study pills provided in clinical trials are greatlyneeded as they may assist in improving the interpretation of findings of futureclinical trials.DOI: 10.2147/PPA.S158682 PMCID: PMC5923253PMID: 29731611
