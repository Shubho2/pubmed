A recurrentneural network with long short-term memory cells was trained on α-helicalcationic amphipathic peptide sequences and then fine-tuned with 26 known ACPs by transfer learning. This optimized model was used to generate unique and novelamino acid sequences. Twelve of the peptides were synthesized and tested fortheir activity on MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells and selectivity against human erythrocytes. Ten of these peptides were active against cancer cells. Sixof the active peptides killed MCF7 cancer cells without affecting humanerythrocytes with at least threefold selectivity. These results advocateconstructive machine learning for the automated design of peptides with desiredbiological activities.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
