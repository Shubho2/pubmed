Here we showthat Stx3 (syntaxin 3) unexpectedly also functions as a nuclear regulator of geneexpression. We found that alternative splicing creates a soluble isoform that we termed Stx3S, lacking the transmembrane anchor. Soluble Stx3S binds to thenuclear import factor RanBP5 (RAN-binding protein 5), targets to the nucleus, andinteracts physically and functionally with several transcription factors,including ETV4 (ETS variant 4) and ATF2 (activating transcription factor 2).Stx3S is differentially expressed in normal human tissues, during epithelial cellpolarization, and in breast cancer versus normal breast tissue. Inhibition ofendogenous Stx3S expression alters the expression of cancer-associated genes and promotes cell proliferation. Similar nuclear-targeted, soluble forms of othersyntaxins were identified, suggesting that nuclear signaling is a conserved,novel function common among these membrane-trafficking proteins.Â© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA117.000874 PMCID: PMC5900775 [Available on 2019-04-13]PMID: 29475951
