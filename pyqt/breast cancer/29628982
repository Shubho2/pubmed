We performed a meta-analysis of published studies to clarify this relationship.Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochranedatabase for studies investigating the association between endocrinetreatment-related symptoms and patient survival. Random-effects meta-analysis wasconducted with recurrence rate as the primary outcome.Results: Out of 7,713 retrieved articles, six studies were included. In patients who received endocrine treatment, the presence of any endocrine treatment-relatedsymptom was found to be associated with a lower recurrence rate in comparison to an absence of any symptoms (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval[CI], 0.66-0.87). This relationship persisted in patients presenting with onlyvasomotor or only musculoskeletal symptoms (HR, 0.74, 95% CI, 0.63-0.87; HR,0.69, 95% CI, 0.55-0.86, respectively). At both time-points of symptom evaluation(3 months and 12 months), patients with endocrine treatment-related symptoms had a lower recurrence rate (HR, 0.74, 95% CI, 0.66-0.84; HR, 0.79, 95% CI,0.69-0.90, respectively). This association was also significant in pooled studiesincluding patients with and without baseline symptoms (HR, 0.73, 95% CI,0.54-0.99; HR, 0.76, 95% CI, 0.69-0.85, respectively).Conclusion: Endocrine treatment-related symptoms are significantly predictive of lower recurrence rate in breast cancer patients, regardless of the type ofsymptoms, time-point of evaluation, or inclusion of baseline symptoms. Thesesymptoms could be biomarkers for the prediction of long-term responses toendocrine treatment in patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.1.37 PMCID: PMC5880964PMID: 29628982
