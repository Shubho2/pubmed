The atlas of data set was then created for automatic delineation. 30 patients with breast/chest wall and lymph nodes regions irradiated were recruitedfor evaluation. With the same treatment position, the CT scan images wereacquired and then contoured by the MIRADA system automatically as well as by the radiation oncologist manually (as the reference). The conformity index (CI) wasused to evaluate the concordance between both of them.RESULTS: The mean time for manual contour was 24.1 ± 5.1 and 26.4 ± 2.8 min forthe LN and the OARs respectively. All the volumes of interest were contouredusing the software (including corrections) in 30 min, which reduced the time ofdelineation of target volumes and OAR by about 40%. Of the 30 cases evaluated,the mean CI of 5 principal OARs showed ≥0.8. While the automatic contour of LNwas less satisfactory with mean CI of 0.43 ± 0.1 (0.23-0.52).CONCLUSION: For the breast cancer patients, the studied software permitted tosave time for delineation with acceptable OAR contours. The improvement of LNregions contour is needed. More cases and further evaluation are needed for thesystem to realize its routine use. Advances in knowledge: It's the firstdescription and evaluation of the automatic delineation and segmentation systemfor the breast cancer.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20180095 PMID: 29947264
