Trials describe treatment outcomes in single specified lines of therapy; but few data describe treatment outcomes across thewhole treatment pathway, which is critical in determining when patients should bereferred for trials and to inform discussion. We evaluated treatment outcomes foraTNBC (overall response rate [ORR], median progression-free survival [mPFS] andmedian overall survival [mOS]) in patients treated largely outside of clinicaltrials.METHODS: We retrospectively identified 268 patients diagnosed with aTNBC from01/12/2011 to 30/11/2016 from our electronic records and recorded patients' andtumour characteristics and treatment outcomes. Chi-squared/Fishers exact test andKaplan-Meier statistical methods were utilised.RESULTS: 186 patients treated with ≥1 line of systemic treatment were eligibleand had median age of 55 (range 26-91). 53.8% had ECOG Performance Status 0 and69.9% visceral involvement. 38.6% had disease-free interval (DFI)≤12 monthsfollowing surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy completion and 14.0% had de-novoadvanced disease. 11.4% carried a BRCA mutation. 64.5% received two lines oftherapy, 37.6% three and 21.5% four. ORR and mPFS were 43.9% and 3.7 months forfirst-line therapy, 40.2% and 3.5 months for second-line, 28.8% and 2.5 monthsfor third-line and 25.0% and 2.1 months for fourth-line. In first line, DFI>12months was associated with higher ORR and longer PFS compared DFI ≤12 months.CONCLUSIONS: The observed response rates are consistent with literature. However,PFS is short, and early consideration of clinical trials can be justified inthese patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.breast.2018.04.014 PMID: 29698926
