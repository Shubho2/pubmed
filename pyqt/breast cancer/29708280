Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the Ki-67 index (≥14% versus < 14%), which is used to define luminal type B and luminal type A, respectively. The mean shear wave velocity(SWVmean ) and lesion-to-adjacent tissues ratio (SWV ratio) were calculated foreach lesion.RESULTS: The SWVmean , SWV ratio, histologic grade, axillary lymph nodeinvolvement, and lymphovascular invasion showed a significant positiveassociation with a high Ki-67 index (all P < .05). Receiver operatingcharacteristic curve analysis for the differential diagnosis between high (≥14%) and low (<14%) Ki-67 groups displayed that the optimal cutoff value for SWVmeanand SWV ratio were 3.99 meters per second and 2.861, with sensitivity 94% and72%, specificity 40.6% and 56.2%, and area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve of 0.689 and 0.651, respectively. Univariate analysis showedthat SWVmean (P = .005), SWV ratio (P = .029), histologic grade (P = .011),presence of axillary node involvement (P = .004), and lymphovascular invasion(P = .008) were significantly associated with high Ki-67 status. Multivariableanalysis displayed that SWVmean (hazard ratio [HR], 1.459, 95% confidenceinterval [CI], 1.028-2.072; P = .035), histologic grade (HR, 4.105; 95% CI,1.142-14.763; P = .031), and presence of axillary node involvement (HR, 3.75; 95%CI, 1.228-11.453; P = .020) maintained significance for predicting high Ki-67status.CONCLUSIONS: The SWVmean using the virtual touch tissue imaging quantificationmethod showed significant correlation with the Ki-67 index, suggesting thepotential to assess tumor proliferation status in luminal-type breast cancer witha noninvasive manner.© 2018 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/jum.14663 PMID: 29708280
