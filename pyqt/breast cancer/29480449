Clinical andpathological parameters of the patients were retrieved and the predictive factorsfor NAC response were evaluated.RESULTS: 705 patients showed clinical response (cRes), and 131 patients acquired pathologic complete response (pCR). Patients with higher pretreatment Ki67(≥ 14%), tumor size ≥ 4 cm, and positive clinical nodal had better clinicaltherapy response, while patients with negative ER and PR, higher pretreatmentKi67 (≥ 14%), and tumor size < 4 cm were more probable to attain pCR. Thepretreatment Ki67 could be used as a predictor of NAC only in luminal subtypes,and 25.5% were identified as an ideal cut-off point to differentiate the cResfrom non-cRes cases. Although a decrease in Ki67 had been found in almost allmolecular subtypes after NAC, no statistically significant differences were foundin the decrease of Ki67 were validated between the cRes and non-cRes group inHER2-rich and triple-negative subtypes (P = 0.488 and P = 0.111, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The best cut-off for pretreatment Ki67 in predicting the connection with the tumor size lessening was 25.5% in luminal subtype. Aggressive adjuvantsystemic treatments should be considered for patients with HER2-rich andtriple-negative subtype who exhibit tumor shrinkage in NAC but still have highlevels of Ki67.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4730-1 PMCID: PMC5993857PMID: 29480449
