Moreover, the accuracy of prediction models remains low. For women who developbreast cancer early, the genetic architecture is less established.METHODS: To identify loci associated with early-onset breast cancer, gene-basedtests were carried out using exome array data from 3479 women with breast cancer diagnosed before age 50 and 973 age-matched controls. Replication was undertaken in a population that developed breast cancer at all ages of onset. Three generegions were associated with breast cancer incidence: FGFR2 (p = 1.23⋅10 - 5;replication p &lt; 1.00⋅10 - 6), NEK10 (p = 3.57⋅10 - 4; replicationp &lt; 1.00⋅10 - 6), and SIVA1 (p = 5.49⋅10 - 4; replication p &lt; 1.00⋅10 - 6).Of the 151 gene regions reported in previous literature, 19 (12.5%) showedevidence of association (p &lt; 0.05) with the risk of early-onset breast cancer in the early-onset population.RESULTS: To predict incidence, whole-genome prediction was implemented on asubset of 3076 participants who were additionally genotyped on a genome widearray. The whole-genome prediction outperformed a polygenic risk score (AUC:0.636; 95%CI: 0.614-0.659 compared to 0.601; 95%CI: 0.578-0.623), and whencombined with known epidemiologic risk factors, the AUC rose to 0.662 (95%CI:0.640-0.684).CONCLUSIONS: This research supports a role for variation within FGFR2 and NEK10in breast cancer incidence, and suggests SIVA1 as a novel risk locus.IMPACT: This analysis supports a shared genetic etiology between women withearly- and late-onset breast cancer, and suggests whole-genome data can improverisk assessment.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-17-1185 PMID: 29898891
