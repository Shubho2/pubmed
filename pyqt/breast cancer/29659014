[Epub ahead of print]Single CpG hypermethylation, allele methylation errors, and decreased expression of multiple tumor suppressor genes in normal body cells of mutation-negativeearly-onset and high-risk breast cancer patients.Böck J(1), Appenzeller S(2), Haertle L(1), Schneider T(1), Gehrig A(1), Schröder J(1), Rost S(1), Wolf B(3)(4), Bartram CR(5), Sutter C(5), Haaf T(1).Author information: (1)Institute of Human Genetics, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany.(2)Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital, Würzburg, Germany.(3)University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland, Fribourg, Switzerland.(4)Department of Bioinformatics, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany.(5)Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.To evaluate the role of constitutive epigenetic changes in normal body cells ofBRCA1/BRCA2-mutation negative patients, we have developed a deep bisulfitesequencing assay targeting the promoter regions of 8 tumor suppressor (TS) genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, ATM, PTEN, TP53, MLH1, RB1) and the estrogene receptorgene (ESR1), which plays a role in tumor progression. We analyzed blood samplesof two breast cancer (BC) cohorts with early onset (EO) and high risk (HR) for a heterozygous mutation, respectively, along with age-matched controls. Methylationanalysis of up to 50,000 individual DNA molecules per gene and sample allowedquantification of epimutations (alleles with >50% methylated CpGs), which areassociated with epigenetic silencing. Compared to ESR1, which is representativefor an average promoter, TS genes were characterized by a very low (< 1%) averagemethylation level and a very low mean epimutation rate (EMR; < 0.0001% to 0.1%). With exception of BRCA1, which showed an increased EMR in BC (0.31% vs. 0.06%),there was no significant difference between patients and controls. One of 36 HRBC patients exhibited a dramatically increased EMR (14.7%) in BRCA1, consistentwith a disease-causing epimutation. Approximately one third (15 of 44) EO BCpatients exhibited increased rates of single CpG methylation errors in multipleTS genes. Both EO and HR BC patients exhibited global underexpression of blood TSgenes. We propose that epigenetic abnormalities in normal body cells areindicative of disturbed mechanisms for maintaining low methylation andappropriate expression levels and may be associated with an increased BC risk.© 2018 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley & SonsLtd on behalf of UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31526 PMID: 29659014
