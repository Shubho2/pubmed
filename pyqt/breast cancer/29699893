The resource and time commitments associated with DIBH are impediments to its widespread adoption. We report the dosimetricbenefits, workforce requirements, and potential reduction in cardiac mortalitywhen DIBH is used for left-sided breast cancers.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data regarding the time consumed for planning and treating50 patients with left-sided breast cancer with DIBH and 20 patients treated with free breathing (FB) radiation therapy were compiled prospectively for allpersonnel (regarding person-hours [PH]). A second plan was generated for all DIBHpatients in the FB planning scan, which was then compared with the DIBH plan.Mortality reduction from use of DIBH was calculated using the years of life lost resulting from ischemic heart disease for Indians and the postulated reduction inrisk of major cardiac events resulting from reduced cardiac dose.RESULTS: The median reduction in mean heart dose between the DIBH and FB planswas 166.7 cGy (interquartile range, 62.7-257.4). An extra 6.76 PH were requiredwhen implementing DIBH as compared with FB treatments. Approximately 3.57 PH werenecessary per Gy of reduction in mean heart dose. The excess years of life lostfrom ischemic heart disease if DIBH was not done in was 0.95 per 100 patients,which translates into a saving of 12.8 hours of life saved per PH of workrequired for implementing DIBH. DIBH was cost effective with cost forimplementation of DIBH for all left-sided breast cancers at 2.3 times the annual per capita gross domestic product.CONCLUSION: Although routine implementation of DIBH requires significant resourcecommitments, it seems to be worthwhile regarding the projected reductions incardiac mortality.Copyright Â© 2018.
