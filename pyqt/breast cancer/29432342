A technetium Tc methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy was performed in a 47-year-old woman as part of the breast cancer evaluation. The images showedintense methylene diphosphonate activity on both sides of the frontal head, whereshe received collagen injection 1 year prior. The activity was visualized againin all 3 follow-up bone scans over the subsequent 3 years.DOI: 10.1097/RLU.0000000000001994 PMID: 29432342
