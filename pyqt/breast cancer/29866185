Therefore it is is essential to develop patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)that capture the full range of issues relevant to disease-free cancer survivors. The objectives of this project are: 1) to develop a European Organisation forResearch and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaire that captures the fullrange of physical, mental and social HRQOL issues relevant to disease-free cancersurvivors; and 2) to determine at which minimal time since completion oftreatment the questionnaire should be used.METHODS: We reviewed 134 publications on cancer survivorship and interviewed 117 disease-free cancer survivors with 11 different types of cancer across 14countries in Europe to generate an exhaustive, provisional list of HRQOL issuesrelevant to cancer survivors. The resulting issue list, the EORTC corequestionnaire (QLQ-C30), and site-specific questionnaire modules were completedby a second group of 458 survivors.RESULTS: We identified 116 generic survivorship issues. These issues covered bodyimage, cognitive functioning, health behaviors, negative and positive outlook,health distress, mental health, fatigue, sleep problems, physical functioning,pain, several physical symptoms, social functioning, and sexual problems.Patients rated most of the acute symptoms of cancer and its treatment (e.g.nausea) as no longer relevant approximately one year after completion oftreatment.CONCLUSIONS: Compared to existing cancer survivorship questionnaires, ourfindings underscore the relevance of assessing issues related to chronic physicalside effects of treatment such as neuropathy and joint pain. We will furtherdevelop a core survivorship questionnaire and three site-specific modules fordisease-free adult cancer survivors who are at least one year post-treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s12955-018-0920-0 PMCID: PMC5987570PMID: 29866185
