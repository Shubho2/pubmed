It avoids lymphadenectomy in occult carcinoma but is associatedwith increased morbidity. Women with BRCA mutations have a higher incidence ofoccult carcinoma and our objective was to assess the clinical utility of sentinellymph node biopsy when these women undergo prophylactic mastectomy.Materials and Methods: Seven-year retrospective consecutive case-series study of women, with a BRCA deleterious mutation, admitted to prophylactic mastectomy, at our center. Breast MRI < 6 months before surgery was routine, unlesscontraindicated.Results: Fifty-seven patients (43% BRCA1; 57% BRCA2) underwent 80 prophylacticmastectomies. 72% of patients had had breast cancer treated before prophylacticmastectomy or synchronously to it. The occult carcinoma incidence was 5%, andhalf of the cases were invasive. SLNB was performed in 19% of the prophylacticmastectomies; none of these had tumor invasion. Women with invasive carcinoma whohad not undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy were followed closely with axillary ultrasound. The median follow-up was 37 months, with no local recurrence; 1patient died of primary tumor systemic relapse.Conclusions: Our data do not support this procedure for routine (in agreementwith previous literature), in this high risk for occult carcinoma population.DOI: 10.1155/2018/1426369 PMCID: PMC5817815PMID: 29507815
