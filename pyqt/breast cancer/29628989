Apopulation-based cost analysis was performed for cancer-related diagnoses between1999 and 2014, using respective public government funded databases. Among thefive most common cancers, breast cancer mortality was strongly associated withthe growth in gross domestic product between 1999 and 2014 (R=0.98). In thefemale population, breast cancer represented the greatest productivity loss amongall cancers, which was a consequence of the peak in the incidence of breastcancer during mid-working age in the working-age population, in addition to beingthe most common and fastest growing cancer among South Korean women. Our studyshows that breast cancer not only represents a significant disease burden forindividual patients, but also contributes a real, nonnegligible loss inproductivity in the South Korean economy.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.1.91 PMCID: PMC5880971PMID: 29628989
