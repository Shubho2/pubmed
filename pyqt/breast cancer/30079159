The c.68_69delAG,c.181T>G, c.798_799delTT mutations in BRCA1 were observed in Moroccan, Algerianand Tunisian Breast Cancer families and were described founder mutation inNorthern Africa. The 943ins10 is also recognized a founder mutation in WestAfrica. To our knowledge no study has been published on BRCA1/2 germlinemutations and hereditary breast cancer (HBC) in population of Burkina Faso. Theaim of the present study (first in Burkina Faso) was to screen for these fourmutations in 15 unrelated patients with HBC. Mutation analysis was performed bySanger sequencing of coding exon2, Exon5 and exon11A sequences of the BRCA1 gene.Blood specimens of 15 patients from Burkina Faso, with HBC were collected at the University Hospital Yalgado OUEDRAOGO (CHU-YO) of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso.c.68_69delAG (exon2), c.181T>G (exon5), c.798_799delTT and 943ins10 (exon11)mutations were not detected in any of the 15 women diagnosed with family breastcancer history. Genetic analysis in this study, we show that targeting relevantexons in BRCA1 genes did not allow detection of mutations in the population ofBurkina Faso. Therefore, such an approach may be of interest to perfom a completesequencing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in families at a high risk of developingbreast cancer in Burkina Faso.DOI: 10.4081/jphia.2018.663 PMCID: PMC6057717PMID: 30079159
