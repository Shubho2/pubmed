This observationalstudy aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of letrozole in postmenopausalKorean women with operable breast cancer.Methods: Self-reported quality of life (QoL) scores were serially assessed for 3 years during adjuvant letrozole treatment using the Korean version of theFunctional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast questionnaires (version 3).Changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and serum cholesterol levels were alsoexamined.Results: All 897 patients received the documented informed consent form andcompleted a baseline questionnaire before treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy wasadministered to 684 (76.3%) subjects, and 410 (45.7%) and 396 (44.1%) patientshad stage I and II breast cancer, respectively. Each patient completedquestionnaires at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after enrollment. Of 897patients, 749 (83.5%) completed the study. The dropout rate was 16.5%. The serialtrial outcome index, the sum of the physical and functional well-being subscales,increased gradually and significantly from baseline during letrozole treatment(p<0.001). The mean serum cholesterol level increased significantly from 199 to205 after 36 months (p=0.042). The mean BMD significantly decreased from -0.39 atbaseline to -0.87 after 36 months (p<0.001).Conclusion: QoL gradually improved during letrozole treatment. BMD and serumcholesterol level changes were similar to those in Western countries, indicating that adjuvant letrozole treatment is well tolerated in Korean women, with minimalethnic variation.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.182 PMCID: PMC6015975PMID: 29963114
