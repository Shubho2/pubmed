We report successful management withluteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist of ovarian hyperstimulation induced by tamoxifen. A 49-year-old woman was operated on for invasive ductalcarcinoma of the right breast. She received breast irradiation and adjuvanttamoxifen therapy. After 2 years, she had a cystic ovarian mass, and her serumconcentration of estradiol was 1280 pg/mL. She was treated with an injection of11.25 mg leuprolide acetate, a long-acting LHRH agonist, without abandoningtamoxifen therapy. The levels of estradiol decreased to <10 pg/mL and the cystic mass disappeared 2 months later. Three-month depot treatment with LHRH agonistscan be useful for patients receiving tamoxifen for breast cancer who have ovariancysts and supraphysiological levels of estrogen.DOI: 10.1155/2018/4931852 PMCID: PMC5827888PMID: 29607235
