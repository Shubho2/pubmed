Identification of CRMs would contribute to explore themiRNAs and TFs regulatory mechanism to specific cancer. However, few studiesconsidered the functional modules which contain TFs and overlapping parts now. Inthis paper, we propose a novel computational framework called overlappingspectral clustering (OSC) to systematically detect overlapping CRMs usingmiRNA/mRNA/TF expression profiles. First, empirical Bayes theories are used toimprove building more exact relation matrix instead of simple Pearson correlationanalysis. In order to ensure the adaptivity of the whole framework, theeigenvalue decomposition (Eigengap) is employed to determine the module numberautomatically. Then considering key regulators which may involve in more functionmodules, we propose a novel overlapping detection approach to observe whether theedges between modules can be overlapped by other modules. Comparing with existingmethods on breast cancer and ovary cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas,we showed that the CRMs identified by OSC are more functionally enriched. 80% TFsand 90% miRNAs in CRMs are related to corresponding diseases. And the overlappingparts between CRMs were also analyzed and verified by standard databases andprevious literatures.DOI: 10.1109/TNB.2018.2805846 PMID: 29870337
