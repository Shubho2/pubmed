China.Rapid proliferation is one of the critical characteristics of breast cancer.However, the underlying regulatory mechanism of breast cancer cell proliferation is largely unclear. The present study indicated that sevoflurane, one ofinhalational anesthetics, could significantly suppress breast cancer cellproliferation by arresting cell cycle at G1 phase. Notably, the rescue experimentindicated that miR-203 was upregulated by sevoflurane and mediated the functionof sevoflurane on suppressing the breast cancer cell proliferation. The presentstudy indicated the function of the sevoflurane/miR-203 signaling pathway onregulating breast cancer cell proliferation. These results provide mechanisticinsight into how the sevoflurane/miR-203 signaling pathway supressesproliferation of breast cancer cells, suggesting the sevoflurane/miR-203 pathway may be a potential target in the treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8949 PMID: 29750301
