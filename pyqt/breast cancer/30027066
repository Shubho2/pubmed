Many patients are frequently admitted to the operating theaters formastectomies. Thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) is increasingly used as aneffective means for post-operative pain relief. The present study aimed atevaluating the effectiveness and safety of dexmedetomidine and nalbuphine as anadjuvant to bupivacaine local anesthetic in thoracic paravertebral block inbreast cancer surgeries.Methods: A total of 60 female patients aged 18 to 78 were included in the study, and ASA I, II, III were scheduled for mastectomy. These patients wereunsystematically assigned into three 20-member groups: group PB receivedbupivacaine (0.3 mL/ kg) + 1 mL (0.9% sodium chloride) normal saline; group PBDreceived bupivacaine (0.3 mL/kg) + dexmedetomidine 1 Î¼g/kg; and Group PBNreceived bupivacaine (0.3 mL/kg) and 10 mg (1 mL) nalbuphine. Demographic data,intraoperative SPO2, ETCO2, HR, SBP and DBP, pain scores (at rest and movement), and sedation scores were recorded every 30 minutes during the initial 2 hours and4, 8, 24, and 48 hours from T0. Also, postoperative tramadol consumption, thetime to the first analgesic request, and any complications were also recorded.Results: There were no statistically significant differences among the threegroups regarding demographic data, SPO2, ETCO2, HR, SBP and DBP intraoperatively.Moreover, no significant difference was found in HR, SBP and DBP postoperatively.Postoperative pain scores were significantly higher in group BP, whether at rest or movement. The sedation was significantly higher in PBD group in the first 12hours postoperatively. There was a significantly lower postoperative tramadolconsumption in PBN group and a significantly longer time to the first analgesicrequest than other groups. No complications were reported in any group.Conclusions: Addition of nalbuphine 10 mg as an adjuvant to bupivacaine localanesthetic in PVB improved the quality of the block and decreased postoperativeanalgesic requirements than the bupivacaine only group and dexmedetomidine andbupivacaine group. However, adding dexmedetomidine to bupivacaine increased thetime to the first analgesic request and more sedation than bupivacaine andbupivacaine and nalbuphine.DOI: 10.5812/aapm.13308 PMCID: PMC6045777PMID: 30027066
