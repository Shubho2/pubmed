SE was performed onall patients and ILC was subsequently diagnosed by surgical or ultrasound-guided biopsy. BI-RADS 1, 2, 6 and Tsukuba BGR cases were omitted. BI-RADS scores wererecorded before and after the use of SE. The differences between scores werecompared to the ILC tumor size using nonparametric tests and logistic binaryregression. We controlled for age, focality, clinical assessment,heredo-collateral antecedents, B-mode and Doppler ultrasound examination. An ROC curve was used to identify the optimal cut-off point for size in relationship to BI-RADS classificationdifference using Youden's index.RESULTS: The histological subtypes of ILC lesions (n=180) included in the sample were luminal A (70%, n=126), luminal B (27.78%, n=50), triple negative (1.67%,n=3) and HER2+ (0.56%, n=1). The BI-RADS classification was higher when SE wasperformed (Z=- 6.629, p<0.000). The ROC curve identified a cut-off point of 13 mmfor size in relationship to BI-RADS classification difference (J=0.670, p<0.000).Small ILC tumors were 17.92% more likely to influence BI-RADS classification(p<0.000).CONCLUSIONS: SE offers enhanced BI-RADS classification in small ILC tumors (<13mm). Sonoelastography brings added value to B-mode breast ultrasound as anadjacent to mammography in breast cancer screening.PMID: 29730679
