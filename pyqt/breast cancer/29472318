Epub 2018 Feb 22.Fork Protection and Therapy Resistance in Hereditary Breast Cancer.Cantor SB(1), Calvo JA(1).Author information: (1)Department of Molecular, Cell, and Cancer Biology, University of MassachusettsMedical School, UMASS Memorial Cancer Center, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605.The BRCA-Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway preserves the genome and suppresses cancerand is a main determinant of chemotherapeutic efficacy. The hereditary breastcancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 function in DNA double-strand break repair mediatingdistinct steps of homologous recombination (HR). More recently, independent ofDNA repair, functions in the replication stress response have come to light,providing insight as to how the BRCA-FA pathway also balances genome preservationwith proliferation. The BRCA-FA proteins associate with the replisome andcontribute to the efficiency and recovery of replication following perturbations that slow or arrest DNA replication. Although the full repertoire of functions inthe replication stress response remains to be elucidated, the function of BRCA1and BRCA2 in protecting stalled replication forks contributes along with HR tothe sensitivity of BRCA-associated tumors to chemotherapy. Moreover,chemoresistance evolves from restoration of either HR and/or fork protection.Although mechanisms underlying the restoration of HR have been characterized, it remains less clear how restoration of fork protection is achieved. Here, weoutline mechanisms of "rewired" fork protection and chemotherapy resistance inBRCA cancer. We propose that mechanisms are linked to permissive replication thatlimits fork remodeling and therefore opportunities for fork degradation.Combating this chemoresistance mechanism will require drugs that inactivatereplication bypass mechanisms.Â© 2017 Cantor and Calvo; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.DOI: 10.1101/sqb.2017.82.034413 PMCID: PMC6041132PMID: 29472318
