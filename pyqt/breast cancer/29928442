Immature DCs were primed by viable MCF-7 breastcancer cells and the activity and maturation of DCs were assessed throughmeasuring CD83, CD86 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II expression, inaddition to different T cell subpopulations, namely CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells,and CD4+CD25+ forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3)+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), by flowcytometric analysis. Foxp3 level was also measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay (ELISA) in addition to reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) weredetermined by ELISA. Finally, the cytotoxicity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) was evaluated through measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release by ELISA. Theresults demonstrated that CD83+, CD86+ and MHC-II+ DCs were significantlyelevated (P<0.001) following priming with breast cancer cells. In addition, therewas increased activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, with a significant decrease ofCD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs (P<0.001). Furthermore, a significant downregulation ofFOXP3 gene expression (P<0.001) was identified, and a significant decrease in thelevel of its protein following activation (P<0.001) was demonstrated by ELISA.Additionally, significant increases in the secretion of IL-12 and IFN-γ (P=0.001)were observed. LDH release was significantly increased (P<0.001), indicating amarked cytotoxicity of CTLs against cancer cells. Therefore viable breast cancer cell-DC-based vaccines could expose an innovative avenue for a novel breastcancer immunotherapy.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8631 PMCID: PMC6006460PMID: 29928442
