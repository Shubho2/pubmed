Primary endpoints were safety and overall response rate (ORR), based onResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1 (RECIST v1.1) as assessedby investigator review.Results: Between April 2014 and January 2015, 25 patients were enrolled. Median number of prior therapies for breast cancer, includingendocrine agents, was 9 (range, 3-15). Median follow-up was 9.7 months (range,0.7-31.8 months). Three patients experienced partial response (PR) and noneexperienced complete response (CR), resulting in an ORR of 12.0% (95% CI,2.5%-31.2%); 16% of patients had stable disease (SD) and clinical benefit rate(CR + PR + [SD for ≥24 weeks]) was 20% (95% CI, 7-41). Median duration ofresponse was 12.0 months (range, 7.4-15.9 months). The incidence oftreatment-related adverse events was 64%; nausea (20%) and fatigue (12%) weremost common and were predominantly grade 1/2. No treatment-relateddiscontinuations or deaths occurred.Conclusions: Pembrolizumab was well toleratedwith modest but durable overall response in certain patients with previouslytreated, advanced, PD-L1-positive, ER+/HER2- breast cancer.
