China.The present study aimed to detect the expression of Caspase-1 in the tumortissues and tumor-adjacent tissues of patients with breast cancer, and toinvestigate the effects of Caspase-1 on the proliferation, apoptosis and invasionof breast cancer cells. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chainreaction was used to detect Caspase-1 mRNA expression in breast cancer tissuesand tumor-adjacent tissues from patients. Additionally, the human breast cancerMDA-MB-231 cell line was treated with the Caspase-1 small molecule inhibitorAc-YVAD-CMK, following which the changes to Caspase-1 protein expression weredetected via western blotting. The MTT method detected the changes to cellproliferation, flow cytometry detected the rate of apoptosis, and a Transwellassay was employed to assess invasion. Caspase-1 mRNA expression wassignificantly decreased in the breast cancer tissues of patients, compared within the tumor-adjacent tissues, a difference that was statistically significant(P<0.05). Treatment with the Ac-YVAD-CMK markedly decreased the proteinexpression of Caspase-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells, and the difference was statisticallysignificant (P<0.05). Following this treatment of Ac-YVAD-CMK cells, theproliferation and invasion abilities markedly increased, while the apoptoticlevels significantly decreased (P<0.05). In conclusion, the expression ofCaspase-1 is low in breast cancer tissues, which may promote the proliferationand invasion of breast cancer cells and could be closely associated with theoccurrence and development of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8176 PMCID: PMC5920210PMID: 29725399
