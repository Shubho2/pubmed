Lesions were atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) (n = 21), lobular neoplasia [n = 36; atypical lobularhyperplasia (ALH) (n = 22), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (n = 6), and ALHplus LCIS (n = 8)], and other high-risk lesion (n = 42; papillary lesions, radialscar, flat epithelial atypia, atypia unspecified). Of 53 excised lesions, 6 (11%)were upgraded to invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). 4 of 21(19%) ADH lesions were upgraded to DCIS. 2 of 36 (6%) lobular neoplasia lesions, both combined ALH and LCIS, were upgraded to DCIS, and invasive lobularcarcinoma, respectively. The remaining 46 lesions were managed conservativelywith imaging follow-up: 17 (37%) had mammography only, while 29 (63%) hadmammography and MRI follow-up. There was no evidence of breast cancer developmentat the site of MRI-VAB in the cases with only imaging follow-up.CONCLUSION: We conclude that the upgrade rate for high-risk lesions at MRI-VAB atsurgical excision is low. Surgical excision is warranted for ADH and combinedALH-LCIS lesions. For other lesions, a multidisciplinary approach to decide onpersonalized management may be appropriate. Advances in knowledge: Surgicalexcision is warranted for ADH lesions and combined ALH-LCIS lesions identified atbreast MRI-VAB. A multidisciplinary approach to patient management of otherhigh-risk lesions may be appropriate.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20180300 PMID: 29947265
