Electronic address: abramczy@mitr.p.lodz.pl.Combined micro-Raman imaging and AFM imaging are efficient methods for analyzing human tissue due to their high spatial and spectral resolution as well assensitivity to subtle chemical, structural and topographical changes. The aim of this study was to determine biochemical composition and mechanical topographyaround blood vessels in the tumor mass of human breast tissue. Significantalterations of the chemical composition and structural architecture around theblood vessel were found compared to the normal breast tissue. A pronouncedincrease of collagen-fibroblast-glycocalyx network, as well as enhanced lacticacid, and glycogen activity in patients affected by breast cancer were reported.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
