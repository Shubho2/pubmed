All newlysynthesized compounds displayed potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity in therange of 10.3 ± 0.3 µM-172.5 ± 0.8 µM against the yeast α-glucosidase enzyme whencompared to the standard drug acarbose (IC50 = 750.0 ± 1.5 µM). Among thesecompounds, compounds 6e and 6d displayed the most potent α-glucosidase inhibitoryactivity (IC50 = 10.3 ± 0.3 and 15.7 ± 0.5 µM, respectively). The kineticanalysis of the most potent compounds 6e and 6d revealed that compound 6einhibited α-glucosidase in an uncompetitive manner (Ki = 11 µM) while compound 6dwas a non-competitive inhibitor (Ki = 28 µM) of the enzyme. Then, thecytotoxicity of the most potent compounds (i.e., compounds 6a, 6d, 6e, 6 g, 6j,and 6l) were evaluated for toxicity using the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231,MCF-7, and T-47D by using a MTT assay, and no toxicity was observed.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
