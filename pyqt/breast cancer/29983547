The aim of thisstudy was to explore the effects of a novel nitrogenous heterocyclic compound on glioma and breast cancer cells and to determine its mechanism of action.Methods: We designed and synthesized a novel nitrogenous heterocyclic compound,3-(4-amino-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-2-carboxamido)-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroimidazo[5,1-d][1,2,3,5] tetrazine-8-carboxamide, based on alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (AGPS)using computer-aided drug design (CADD), and we measured its effect on theproliferation, invasion, cell cycle and apoptosis of U251 glioma and MCF-7 breastcancer cells. In addition, the compound's effect on the expression oftumor-related mRNA, circular RNAs (circRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)was explored.Results: It was found that the nitrogenous heterocyclic compound could inducecell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase of U251/MCF-7 cells and activate apoptosis.Real-time PCR showed that the expression levels of tumor-related mRNA, circRNAsand lncRNAs were impacted.Conclusion: We concluded that the nitrogenous heterocyclic compound inhibits the proliferation and invasion of U251 glioma and MCF-7 breast cancer cells throughthe induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by regulating tumor-relatedgenes.DOI: 10.2147/DDDT.S168130 PMCID: PMC6027699PMID: 29983547
