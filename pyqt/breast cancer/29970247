Electronic address: jonathan.james@nuh.nhs.uk.(2)Nottingham Breast Institute, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham NG51PB, UK.(3)Loughborough University, Epinal Way, Loughborough LE11 3TU, UK.AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of computer-aided detection(CAD)-enhanced synthetic mammograms in comparison with standard syntheticmammograms and full-field digital mammography (FFDM).MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CAD-enhanced synthetic mammogram, a standard syntheticmammogram, and FFDM were available in 68 breast-screening cases recalled forsoft-tissue abnormalities (masses, parenchymal deformities, and asymmetricdensities). Two radiologists, blinded to image type and final assessment outcome,retrospectively read oblique and craniocaudal projections for each type ofmammogram. The resulting 204 pairs of 2D images were presented in random orderand scored on a five-point scale (1, normal to 5, malignant) without access tothe Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) slices. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed.RESULTS: There were 34 biopsy-proven malignancies and 34 normal/benign cases.Diagnostic accuracy was significantly improved for the CAD-enhanced syntheticmammogram compared to the standard synthetic mammogram (area under the ROC curve [AUC]=0.846 and AUC=0.683 respectively, p=0.004) and compared to the conventional2D FFDM (AUC=0.724, p=0.027). The CAD-enhanced synthetic mammogram had thehighest diagnostic accuracy for all soft-tissue abnormalities, and for malignant lesions sensitivity was not affected by tumour size. For all 68 cases, there was an average of 3.2 areas enhanced per image. For the 34 cancer cases, 97.4% oflesions were correctly enhanced, with 2.1 false areas enhanced per image.CONCLUSIONS: CAD enhancement significantly improves performance of synthetic 2Dmammograms and also exhibits improved diagnostic accuracy compared toconventional 2D FFDM.Copyright Â© 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
