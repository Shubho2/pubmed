Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania.Internal mammary lymph nodes constitute a major lymphatic chain draining thebreast and a route of spread for breast cancer metastases. Both physiologic andmetastatic internal mammary lymph nodes enhance on breast magnetic resonanceimaging, and the clinical significance of their prevalence, size, and morphology when visualized in a patient with breast cancer remains unknown. We studied thecharacteristics of internal mammary lymph nodes visualized on breast MRI studies before and after neo-adjuvant therapy in twenty-three patients with newlydiagnosed breast cancer. A measured decrease in internal mammary lymph node size on post-neo-adjuvant therapy MRI indicated metastatic involvement. Determiningsuspicious features of internal mammary nodes on initial diagnostic MRI can aidradiologists in reporting probable IMLN metastases and may alter the course ofcare for patients with breast cancer. This study concludes that metastaticinternal mammary lymph nodes should be considered when more than two ipsilateral internal mammary lymph nodes measuring 6 mm or greater are seen on diagnostic MRIin a patient with newly diagnosed breast cancer.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13102 PMID: 30066351
