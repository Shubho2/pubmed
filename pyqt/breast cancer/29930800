Epub 2018 May 23.Molecular functions of SIRPα and its role in cancer.Takahashi S(1).Author information: (1)Division of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Tohoku Medical andPharmaceutical University, Miyagino-ku, Sendai 983-8536, Japan.Signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα), also known as cluster of differentiation(CD)172a or Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase substrate-1, is a cellsurface receptor expressed on myeloid and hematopoietic stem cells and neurons.Accumulating data suggests an important role of SIRPα in cell signaling as anegative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling andmitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In various cancers, includingprostate, breast and liver, as well as astrocytoma and myeloid malignancies,downregulation of SIRPα is frequently observed, resulting in activation of these downstream signaling pathways. In turn, cell proliferation, transformation,migration and invasion may occur. Recently, it has been reported that blockingCD47, an anti-phagocytic signal expressed on tumor cells and an SIRPα ligand, mayserve as a promising therapeutic approach, particular for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. In the present review, the current findings on SIRPα aresummarized, with particular focus on its role in cancer.DOI: 10.3892/br.2018.1102 PMCID: PMC6006759PMID: 29930800
