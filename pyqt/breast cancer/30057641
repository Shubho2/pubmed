Patients were dividedinto two groups by random numbers, 32 women in the AC group and 32 women in thePG group. The costs were measured using the societal perspective andeffectiveness of 2 regimens were assessed using tumor response. By a decisiontree, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. In addition, therobustness of results was examined by sensitivity analysis.Results: The estimated total cost of AC and PG per patient was 1565.23 ± 765.31and 2099.08 ± 926.99, respectively. Response to treatment in AC and PG arm were84% versus 75% respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio resultsshowed AC is a dominate alternative.Conclusion: Overall, AC was a simple dominate strategy. In other words, AC wasestimated to have a lower cost and greater effectiveness than PG.DOI: 10.4103/jrms.JRMS_644_17 PMCID: PMC6040151PMID: 30057641
