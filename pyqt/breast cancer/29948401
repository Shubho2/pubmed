We assessed the LUMImaging System for real-time, intraoperative detection of residual tumor.METHODS: Lumpectomy cavity walls and excised specimens of breast cancerlumpectomy patients were assessed with the LUM Imaging System (Lumicell, Inc.,Wellesley MA) with and without intravenous LUM015, a cathepsin-activatablefluorescent agent. Fluorescence at potential sites of residual tumor wasevaluated with a sterile hand-held probe, displayed on a monitor and correlatedwith histopathology.RESULTS: Background autofluorescence was assessed in excised specimens from 9patients who did not receive LUM015. In vivo lumpectomy cavities and excisedspecimens were then imaged in 15 women undergoing breast cancer surgery whoreceived no LUM015, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg LUM015 (5 women per dose). Among these, 11patients had invasive carcinoma with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 4 hadonly DCIS. Image acquisition took 1 s for each 2.6-cm-diameter surface. Nosignificant background normal breast fluorescence was identified. Elevatedfluorescent signal was seen from invasive cancers and DCIS. Mean tumor-to-normal signal ratios were 4.70 ± 1.23 at 0.5 mg/kg and 4.22 ± 0.9 at 1.0 mg/kg(p = 0.54). Tumor was distinguished from normal tissue in pre-and postmenopausal women and readings were not affected by breast density. Some benign tissuesproduced fluorescent signal with LUM015.CONCLUSION: The LUM Imaging System allows rapid identification of residual tumor in the lumpectomy cavity of breast cancer patients and may reduce rates ofpositive margins.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4845-4 PMID: 29948401
