However, the functional roles of these transcripts responsible for their dysregulation in breast cancer (BC) are not thoroughly understood.METHODS: We examined the expression of microRNA miR-1471 in BC specimens. Online analysis tools predicted that lncRNA LOC101930370 might act as an endogenous'sponge' by competing for miR-1471 binding targets. Luciferase assays were usedto prove the interaction of LOC101930370, miR-1471 and SHH. Edu, wound-healingand transwell assays were used to verify the contribution of miR-1471 andLOC101930370 on MCF-7 cells proliferation and metastasis. Gain and loss offunction studies were performed to evaluate the relevance of Hedgehog pathwaywith LOC101930370/miR-1471 regulating axis in MCF-7 cells.RESULTS: The expression of miR-1471 was markedly downregulated in BC. Inhibition of miR-1471 by LOC101930370 was proved by luciferase assay. Knockdown ofLOC101930370 suppressed BC cells progression. MiR-1471 inhibitor resulted in amore aggressive metastasis of MCF-7 cells. Moreover, SHH and Gli-1 expressionwere significantly suppressed by LOC101930370 knockdown, and upregulated bymiR-1471 inhibitor transfection.CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our study reveals the interaction between LOC101930370and miR-1471 for the first time. LOC101930370 positively regulates the expressionof SHH by sponging miR-1471, which sheds new light on lncRNA-directed diagnosticsand therapeutics in BC.Â© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.
