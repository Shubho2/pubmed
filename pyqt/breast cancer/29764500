The purpose of the presentstudy was to evaluate the role of initial 18F-FDG PET/CT in the management ofpatients with clinical suspected EMP.METHODS: 18F-FDG PET/CT scans performed in 21 patients (M/F = 12/9, mean age51.1 ± 15.3 years) with clear suspicion of EMP from 2006 to 2015 were analysedretrospectively. The detection of new lesions and the change in treatment wereevaluated.RESULTS: PET/CT detected new lesions in 38.1% (8/21) of patients with 17 lesions,and lymph nodes were the most common site, accounting for 70.6% (12/17) of alllesions, followed by bone (n = 2), and less frequently, breast (n = 1), lung(n = 1), and stomach (n = 1). These findings resulted in treatment changes in 7patients with EMP. Among these, 4 patients had major treatment changes and 3patients had minor changes. Of the 21 patients, progression to MM was observed in8 patients (8/21, 38.1%). In univariate analysis, tumour size > 4 cm and partial response (PR) after treatment were significant prognostic factors forProgression-free survival (PFS).CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that 18F-FDG PET/CT is helpful in the detectionof additional lesions throughout the body, including lymph node involvement anddistant additional lesion, which may have resulted in treatment change.DOI: 10.1186/s40644-018-0152-x PMCID: PMC5952599PMID: 29764500
