[Epub ahead of print]Breast cancer biomarkers in clinical testing: analysis of a UK NEQAS ICC & ISHdatabase containing results from 199,300 patients.Dodson A(1)(2), Parry S(3), Ibrahim M(4), Bartlett JMS(5), Pinder S(6), DowsettM(1)(2), Miller K(3).Author information: (1)Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research, The Royal Marsden Hospital,London, UK.(2)The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.(3)UK NEQAS ICC & ISH, University College London Cancer Institute, London, UK.(4)UK NEQAS ICC & ISH, University College London Cancer Institute, London, UK(formerly).(5)Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Ontario, Canada.(6)Cancer Studies, King's College London, London, UK.We describe a collated dataset of results from clinical testing of breast cancerscarried out between 2009 and 2016 in the UK and Republic of Ireland. More than199,000 patient biomarker datasets, together with clinicopathological parameters were collected. Our analyses focused on human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), with the aim ofthe study being to provide robust confirmatory evidence on known associations in these biomarkers and to uncover new data on previously undescribed or unconfirmedbiomarkers, thus strengthening the evidence-base in clinical breast cancertesting. Overall, 13.1% of tumours were HER2-positive; 10.6% in ER-positivetumours and 25.5% in ER-negative tumours. Higher rates of HER2 positivity weresignificantly associated with patient age <56 years versus age ≥56 years,symptomatic versus screen-detected tumours, testing of involved axillary nodeversus primary breast cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma (not otherwise specified)versus other histological types, higher histological grade, increasing tumoursize, increasing nodal involvement, ER-negative versus ER-positive tumour status,PR-negative versus PR-positive tumour status. Where ER status was known, 82.7% oftumours were ER-positive; 80.9% in women age <56 years and 83.6% in those age ≥56years (ER-positive cut-off ≥1.0% positive tumour cells or equivalent). Where PRstatus was known, 64.9% of tumours were PR-positive; 65.8% in women age <56 yearsand 64.4% in women age ≥56 years (PR-positive cut off ≥10.0% or equivalent).These analyses of clinical test results provide contemporary benchmarking datafor HER2, ER and PR positive-rates.
