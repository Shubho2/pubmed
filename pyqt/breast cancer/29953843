Combinationtherapies have attracted great attention. The principal purpose of this study wasto investigate the mechanism of synergism between ABT-199 and paclitaxel.Moreover, we analyzed the biomarker to identify tumors which are most likely torespond to this combination. We evaluated the effect of this combination in apanel of nine cancer cell lines including cervical cancer, lung cancer, ovariancancer, lymphoma, leukemia and breast cancer. Combination index (CI) assay showedthat four of nine call lines exhibited synergistic respond to ABT-199/paclitaxel combination due to enhanced intrinsic apoptosis. However, paclitaxel-inducedBcl-2 phosphorylation impaired the synergistic effect by impeding the freeing of Bax and Bim by ABT-199 because ABT-199 cannot hit phosphorylated Bcl-2 (pBcl-2). By means of a correlation analysis of JNK level with CI value in combination withoverexpressing or silencing JNK protein in cancer cells, we identified basal JNK1level as a potential biomarker for predicting the level of pBcl-2 upon paclitaxeltreatment, and thus for predicting a synergistic response. A cut-off value of0.37 for relative JNK1 expression level was determined using receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) analysis to distinguish between synergistic andnon-synergistic response cancers. A more accurate and valid cut-off value forJNK1 will be gained based on a large-scale clinical samples analysis.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
