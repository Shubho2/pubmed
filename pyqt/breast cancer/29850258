In 2009, we first described BreastLight for screening and reportedhigh sensitivity at detecting breast cancer. Due to limitations of BreastLight,we have since 2014 been using the more technologically advanced Breast-i toscreen 2204 women to find cheaper screening alternatives.Methodology: First, the participant lies down for CBE and then, in a darkenedroom, Breast-i was placed underneath each breast and trained personnel confirmvein pattern and look out for dark spot(s) to ascertain the presence ofsuspicious angiogenic lesion(s).Results: CBE detected 153 palpable breast masses and Breast-i, which detectsangiogenesis, confirmed 136. However, Breast-i detected 22 more cases of which 7 had angiogenesis but were not palpable and 15 were missed by CBE due to largebreast size. Overall confirmed cases were 26, with Breast-i detecting 7 casesmissed by CBE. Breast-i and CBE gave sensitivities of 92.3% and 73%,respectively.Conclusion: Breast-i with its high sensitivity to angiogenesis, reliability, and affordability will be an effective adjunct detection device that can be usedeffectively to increase early detection in younger women, thereby increasingtreatment success.DOI: 10.1155/2018/2539056 PMCID: PMC5904814PMID: 29850258
