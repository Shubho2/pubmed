We reported previously that FS50, a salivary protein from Xenopsylla cheopis, showed inhibitory activity against the NaV1.5channel when assayed in HEK 293T cells and antiarrhythmia effects on rats andmonkeys after induction of arrhythmia by BaCl2. This study aims to identify theeffect of FS50 on voltage-gated sodium channel activity and the motility ofMDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells in vitro. NaV1.5 was abnormally expressed inthe highly metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, but not in the MCF-7cell line. FS50 significantly inhibited sodium current, migration, and invasionin a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells at the working concentrations (1.5-12 μmol/l) after a long-term treatmentfor 48 h. Meanwhile, FS50 decreased NaV1.5 mRNA expression without altering thetotal protein level in MDA-MB-231 cells. Correspondingly, the results also showedthat MMP-9 activity and the ratio of MMP-9 mRNA to TIMP-1 mRNA were markedlydecreased by FS50. Taken together, our findings highlighted for the first time aninhibitory effect of a salivary protein from a blood-feeding arthropod on breast cancer cells through the NaV1.5 channel. Furthermore, this study provided a newcandidate leading molecule against antitumor cells expressing NaV1.5.DOI: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000662 PMID: 29912729
