We aimed to develop an easy and simple method to estimate flap volume.Methods: We performed a preoperative estimation of the TRAM flap volume in fivepatients with breast cancer who underwent 2-stage breast reconstruction followingan immediate tissue expander operation after a simple mastectomy. We measured theheight and width of each flap zone using a ruler and measured the tissuethickness by ultrasound. The volume of each zone, approximated as a triangular orsquare prism, was then calculated. The zone volumes were summed to obtain thetotal calculated volume of the TRAM flap. We then determined the width of zoneII, so that the calculated flap volume was equal to the required flap volume(1.2×1.05×the weight of the resected mastectomy tissue). The TRAM flap wastransferred vertically so that zone III was located on the upper side, and zoneII was trimmed in the sitting position after vascular anastomosis. We comparedthe estimated flap width of zone II (=X) with the actual flap width of zone II.Results: X was similar to the actual measured width. Accurate volume replacement with the TRAM flap resulted in good symmetry in all cases.Conclusions: The volume of a free TRAM flap can be straightforwardly estimatedpreoperatively using the method presented here, with ultrasound, ruler, andsimple calculations, and this technique may help reduced the time required forprecise flap tailoring.DOI: 10.5999/aps.2017.01473 PMCID: PMC6062707PMID: 30037193
