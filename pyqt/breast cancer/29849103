CNTs especially SWCNTs were toxic to organs and induced death at high dosages. In this case, someof the liver cells showed a relative shrinkage which was also confirmed byAnnexin test in MC4L2 cells. Moreover, CNTs decreased the tumor volume. BCL2 genewas down-regulated, and BAX and Caspase-3 were also up-regulated in the treatedgroups with CNTs. As a result, CNTs especially MWCNT in lower dosages can be usedas a promising drug delivery vehicle for targeted therapy of abnormal cells inbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-26790-x PMCID: PMC5976726PMID: 29849103
