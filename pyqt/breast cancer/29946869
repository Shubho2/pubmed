Comprehensive immunohistochemical (IHC) analyseshave not yet been conducted on the expression levels of Hh signaling molecules inbreast cancer tissues.METHODS: A total of 204 patients with invasive breast cancer treated in ourinstitute were study subjects. IHC analyses on the expression levels of the Hhsignaling molecules, sonic Hh (SHH), PTCH1, GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3 and theCSC-related factor, SOX2, were investigated.RESULTS: Positive correlations were observed among all of the Hh signalingmolecules tested. SOX2 expression correlated with the expression levels of all Hhsignaling molecules. SHH expression positively correlated with tumor size, theKi-67 labeling index, histological grade, estrogen receptor negativity,progesterone receptor negativity, and HER2 positivity. GLI1 expression positivelycorrelated with the histological grade. GLI2 expression positively correlatedwith the histological grade, Ki-67 labeling index, and HER2 positivity.Univariate analyses revealed that a younger age, larger tumor size, positivelymph node metastasis, higher histological grade, positive lymphatic invasion,and higher Ki-67 labeling index were related to poor relapse-free survival (RFS).The positivity of all Hh signaling molecules and SOX2 did not correlate with poorRFS. A multivariate analysis revealed that positive lymphatic invasion and ayounger age were independent worse prognostic factors for RFS.CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive analysis demonstrated for the first time thatSHH, GLI1, and GLI2 expression levels positively correlated with the malignantphenotypes of tumor cells.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0884-2 PMID: 29946869
