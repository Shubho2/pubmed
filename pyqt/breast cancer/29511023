The Mps one binder kinaseactivator (MOB) adaptor proteins are core components of Hippo signaling andinfluence Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and transcriptional co-activator withPDZ-binding motif (TAZ), which are potent transcriptional regulators. YAP1/TAZare key contributors to cartilage and bone development but the molecularmechanisms by which the Hippo pathway controls chondrogenesis are largelyunknown. Cartilage is rich in ECM and also subject to strong external forces -two upstream factors regulating Hippo signaling. Chondrogenesis and endochondral ossification are tightly controlled by growth factors, morphogens, hormones, and transcriptional factors that engage in crosstalk with Hippo-YAP1/TAZ signaling.Here, we generated tamoxifen-inducible, chondrocyte-specific Mob1a/b-deficientmice and show that hyperactivation of endogenous YAP1/TAZ impairs chondrocyteproliferation and differentiation/maturation, leading to chondrodysplasia. These defects were linked to suppression of SOX9, a master regulator of chondrogenesis,the expression of which is mediated by TEAD transcription factors. Our dataindicate that a MOB1-dependent YAP1/TAZ-TEAD complex functions as atranscriptional repressor of SOX9 and thereby negatively regulateschondrogenesis.Â© 2018.
