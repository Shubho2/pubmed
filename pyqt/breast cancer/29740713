O. Box 13401, Makkah, 21955, Saudi Arabia.(4)Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Benha University, Banha, Egypt.A novel series of substituted 2-thiohydantoin incorporated with benzoimidazole,pyrazole, triazole and/or benzoxazole moieties has been synthesized using(E)-3-[1-(4-bromophenyl)ethylideneamino]-2-thioxoimidazolidin-4-one 1 as the key starting material. The key material 1 also, reacted with an acetic anhydride,aromatic aldehydes, secondary amines, formaldehyde and triethyl orthoformate togive the corresponding acetyl, chalcone, Mannich bases and ethoxymethylenederivatives, respectively. The structures of the novel compounds were confirmedby spectral data and elemental analysis. The cytotoxic activity of allsynthesized compounds was assessed in vitro against human hepatocellular cancercell line (HePG-2) and breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7). The bioassay resultsrevealed that compound 14 has the best activity against HePG-2 cell line(IC50 = 2.33 μg/mL), while compound 5 has the best activity against MCF-7 cellline (IC50 = 3.98 μg/mL).DOI: 10.1186/s13065-018-0418-1 PMCID: PMC5940965PMID: 29740713
