Email: ysilig@cumhuriyet.edu.trBackground: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in women worldwide. Geneticpolymorphisms have been reported to be important etiological factors. Murinedouble minute 2 (MDM2) T309G interacts with p53 and mutations in p53 are present in approximately 50% of all cancers. However, it has been reported that effect ofthe polymorphism on breast cancer risk may vary in different populations. Here,we therefore investigated whether there is an association between MDM2 T309G(rs2279744) polymorphism and breast cancer in a Turkish population. Materials andMethods: We analysed 110 patients with breast cancer and 138 matched? controls.For genotyping, polymerase chain reaction and restriction length fragmentpolymorphism methods were used. Results: A significant difference was observedbetween case and control groups with regard to the distribution of the MDM2 T309Gpolymorphism (p<0.05). There was a significantly higher frequency of the TTgenotype in the control group (p=0.028; OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.09-5.37). However, wedid not find any relationships among tumor grade and metastasis status and thispolymorphism. Conclusion: This study indicates that the MDM2 T309G polymorphismGG genotype and the TG+GG combination may be risk factors for breast cancer inour Turkish population.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.1059 PMCID: PMC6031795PMID: 29699057
