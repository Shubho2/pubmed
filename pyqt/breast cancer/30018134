Adverseevents (AEs) were assessed throughout treatment and at final follow-up (28 ±5days after last treatment). Subgroups were categorized by body weight, Asianorigin, and chemotherapy administration. All analyses were descriptive.RESULTS: Of 2,577 patients enrolled, 2,573 received ≥1 dose of study medicationand were included in this safety analysis. Median body weight at baseline was67.0 kg (range 33.6-150.0 kg). Any-grade AEs occurred in 88.7% (2,282/2,573) ofthe overall population, versus 87.1% (590/677) of the lowest bodyweight quartile (≤59 kg), 90.0% (561/623) of the highest quartile (>77 kg), and 86.5% (327/378)of the Asian population. Grade ≥3 AEs occurred in 23.2% (596/2,573) of theoverall population, 17.9% (121/677) of the lowest bodyweight quartile, 26.8%(167/623) of the highest quartile, and 15.3% (58/378) of the Asian population.The highest bodyweight quartile had the highest incidence of medical conditionsat baseline (highest quartile, 75.6%; lowest quartile, 56.1%).CONCLUSION: These data support the use of fixed-dose H SC as an adjuvant therapy in HER2-positive EBC and confirm the comparable safety profile of H SC inpatients with low body weight or of Asian origin versus the overall population inSafeHer. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01566721.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The safety profile of fixed-dose subcutaneoustrastuzumab (H SC) was comparable between patients in the lowest bodyweightsubgroup and the overall patient population, and also between patients of Asianorigin (of whom a higher proportion often fall within the lower bodyweightquartiles) and the overall population. The safety data from this SafeHer subgroupanalysis therefore support the use of fixed-dose H SC 600 mg administered every 3weeks as an adjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer across different bodyweight subgroups and in the Asian patient population.© AlphaMed Press 2018.DOI: 10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0065 PMID: 30018134
