As the DNA repair pathway is an important driver intumor response to DDP, we analyzed the mRNA expression of 20 genes involved inthe nucleotide excision repair, fanconi anemia, homologous recombination, baseexcision repair, mismatch repair and translesion repair pathways and themethylation patterns of some of these genes. We also investigated the correlationwith the response to platinum-based therapy. The mRNA levels of the selectedgenes were evaluated by Real Time-PCR (RT-PCR) with ad hoc validated primers and gene promoter methylation by pyrosequencing. All the DNA repair genes werevariably expressed in all 42 PDX samples analyzed, with no particularhistotype-specific pattern of expression. In high-grade serous/endometrioid PDXs,the CDK12 mRNA expression levels positively correlated with the expression ofTP53BP1, PALB2, XPF and POLB. High-grade serous/endometrioid PDXs with TP53mutations had significantly higher levels of POLQ, FANCD2, RAD51 and POLB thanhigh-grade TP53 wild type PDXs. The mRNA levels of CDK12, PALB2 and XPF inverselyassociated with the in vivo DDP antitumor activity; higher CDK12 mRNA levels wereassociated with a higher recurrence rate in ovarian patients with low residualtumor. These data support the important role of CDK12 in the response to aplatinum based therapy in ovarian patients.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25185 PMCID: PMC5973859PMID: 29872499
