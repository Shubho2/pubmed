[Epub ahead of print]Glutamate-weighted chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonanceimaging (GluCEST MRI) detects glutaminase inhibition in a mouse model oftriple-negative breast cancer.Zhou R(1), Bagga P(2), Nath K(2), Hariharan H(3), Mankoff D(4), Reddy R(2).Author information: (1)Radiology, University of Pennsylvania rongzhou@upenn.edu.(2)Radiology, University of Pennsylvania.(3)Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania.(4)Division of Nuclear Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.Glutamate is an important metabolite of glutaminolysis, a metabolic pathwayemployed by many aggressive cancers including triple-negative breast cancer. Withthe exception of the brain, in vivo detection of glutamate using 1H magneticresonance spectroscopy (MRS) is challenging in tissues. Compared to MRS,glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer MR imaging (GluCEST MRI) offers amore sensitive detection mechanism that is free of glutamine interference. Herewe developed a robust, highly repeatable GluCEST MRI protocol in mice bearinghuman triple-negative breast cancer xenografts and treated with the potentglutaminase inhibitor CB-839. In paired studies, treatment with CB-839 for 2 daysreduced the GluCEST asymmetry value compared to baseline (P < 0.05, n=10). Theabsolute change of the GluCEST asymmetry value was -2.5 percent points afterCB-839 treatment versus +0.3 after vehicle (P < 0.01). Correspondingly, treatmentwith CB-839 reduced tumor glutamate concentrations by 1.5 mM, consistent withprior calibration between changes of the GluCEST value versus tissue glutamateconcentration; CB-839, however, did not change tumor intracellular pH. Theseresults demonstrate in a mouse model of TNBC the clinical utility of GluCEST MRI as a means to detect the early response to glutaminase inhibition.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-3988 PMID: 30072394
