This study investigated the association between hormone therapy and diabetes risk in breast cancer survivors. Patients and Methods We performed acase-cohort study of 2,246 female survivors recruited from the Leumit health carefund who were diagnosed with primary nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer in 2002through 2012. A 20% random subcohort was sampled at baseline, and all diabetescases were identified. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimatedby weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results Of 2,246 breastcancer survivors, 324 developed diabetes over a mean follow-up of 5.9 years. The crude cumulative incidence of diabetes that accounted for death as a competingrisk was 20.9% (95% CI, 18.3% to 23.7%). In multivariable-adjusted models,hormone therapy was associated with increased diabetes risk (HR, 2.40; 95% CI,1.26 to 4.55; P = .008). The hazard for tamoxifen use (HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.19 to 4.26; P = .013) was less pronounced than the use of aromatase inhibitors (HR,4.27, 95% CI, 1.42 to 12.84; P = .010). Conclusion Active hormone therapy is asignificant risk factor of diabetes among breast cancer survivors. Althoughcessation of treatment is not recommended because the survival benefits ofhormone therapy outweigh the risks, preventive strategies aimed at lifestylemodifications may minimize the risk.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.76.3524 PMID: 29688833
