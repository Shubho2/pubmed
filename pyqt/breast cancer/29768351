In this systemic review, we performed a meta-analysis to explore whether CDK4/6 inhibitors had asignificantly benefit to treating hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive)/humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-negative) advanced breastcancer.METHODS: The data for meta-analysis were collected from MEDLINE, EMBASE, andCochrane Library from January 1980 to December 2017, and eventually 3182 patientsfrom 6 RCTs were included.RESULTS: The result showed the CDK4/6 inhibitor group had a longerprogression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio = 0.51; 95% confidence interval[CI], 0.46-0.57, P < .00001), a better objective response (risk rate = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.35-1.74, P < .00001), as well as a better clinical benefit response (riskrate = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.13-1.47, P = .0001). Besides, subgroup analyses of PFSaccording to stratification factors and other baseline characteristics confirmed a great performance of CDK4/6 inhibitors across the all subgroups. And sensitive analysis showed that all outcomes were stable except Finn 2014 trail.CONCLUSION: CDK4/6 inhibitors can significantly prolong the PFS and improve theobjective response and clinical benefit response among the patients withHR-positive/ HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010746 PMCID: PMC5976281PMID: 29768351  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
