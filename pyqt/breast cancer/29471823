The study aim was to determine psychometric details of a sevenquestion self-report scale (FCR7) and a short form (FCR4) based upon itemsalready used in various extensive measures of FCR.METHODS: Two consecutive samples of patients (breast and colorectal) wererecruited from a single specialist cancer centre. The survey instrument containedthe FCR7 items, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and demographicdetails. Clinical information was obtained from patient hospital records.Statistical analyses were performed using classical test and item response theoryapproaches, to demonstrate unidimensional factor structure and testing keyparameters. Construct validity was inspected through nomological and theoretical prediction.RESULTS: Internal consistency was demonstrated by alpha coefficients (FCR4: 0.93 and FCR7: 0.92). Both scales (FCR7 & FCR4) were associated with the HADssubscales as predicted. Patients who experienced chemotherapy, minor aches/pains,thought avoidance of cancer and high cancer risk belief were more fearful.Detailed inspection of item responses profile provided some support formeasurement properties of scales.CONCLUSION: The internal consistency, and pattern of key associations anddiscriminability indices provided positive psychometric evidence for thesescales. The brief measures of FCR may be considered for audit, screening orroutine use in clinical service and research investigations.DOI: 10.1186/s12955-018-0850-x PMCID: PMC5822647PMID: 29471823  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
