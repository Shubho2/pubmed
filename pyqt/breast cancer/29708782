Preoperative measurements of residual disease included longest diameter by mammography, MRI, and clinical examination and functional volume on MRI. Theaccuracy of preoperative measurements for detecting pathologic CR and theassociation with final pathology size were assessed for all lesions, separatelyfor single masses and nonmass enhancements (NMEs), multiple masses, and lesionswithout ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).RESULTS: In the 138 women with all four preoperative measures, longest diameterby MRI showed the highest accuracy for detecting pathologic CR for all lesionsand NME (AUC = 0.76 and 0.84, respectively). There was little difference acrosspreoperative measurements in the accuracy of detecting pathologic CR for singlemasses (AUC = 0.69-0.72). Longest diameter by MRI and longest diameter byclinical examination showed moderate ability for detecting pathologic CR formultiple masses (AUC = 0.78 and 0.74), and longest diameter by MRI and longestdiameter by mammography showed moderate ability for detecting pathologic CR fortumors without DCIS (AUC = 0.74 and 0.71). In subjects with residual disease,longest diameter by MRI exhibited the strongest association with pathology sizefor all lesions and single masses (r = 0.33 and 0.47). Associations betweenpreoperative measures and pathology results were not significantly influenced by tumor subtype or mammographic density.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that measurement of longest diameter by MRI ismore accurate than by mammography and clinical examination for preoperativeassessment of tumor residua after NACT and may improve surgical planning.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.17.18323 PMID: 29708782
