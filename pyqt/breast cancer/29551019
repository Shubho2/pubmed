Of these, threestrains whose metabolites had high anticancer activity and low cell toxicity wereselected and identified by their fruiting body morphology, cell morphology, and16S rRNA sequence. Strains KYC4030 and KYC4048 were determined to be Myxococcusfulvus, whereas strain KYC4081 was identified as Corallococcus coralloides. Wefound that metabolites of M. fulvus KYC4048 demonstrated no toxicity in normalcells but specifically induced cancer cell death by suppressing the expression ofWNT2B. This discovery highlights the value of assessing the metabolic andbiomedical potential of myxobacteria, even those that are already known but were isolated from new areas, and the possible use of metabolites from M. fulvusKYC4048 in cancer treatment.DOI: 10.4014/jmb.1711.11003 PMID: 29551019
