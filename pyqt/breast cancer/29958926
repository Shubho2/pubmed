Electronic address:amm7r@virginia.edu.As multigene panel testing for hereditary cancer syndromes becomes commonplace,germline mutations in genes other than BRCA1/2 are increasingly identified inbreast cancer patients. While histopathologic features of BRCA-mutated breastcancers have been well-characterized, less is known about non-BRCA-relatedhereditary cancers. We herein investigate the clinicopathologic characteristicsof breast cancers in women with non-BRCA germline mutations. Out of 612 women whounderwent germline testing, 16 (2.6%) of women with 18 cancers had mutations innon-BRCA genes: ATM, CHEK2, PALB2, TP53, BMPR1A, BRIP1, MUTYH, and RAD50. Anadditional two cancers were identified in a woman with a diagnosis of Bloomsyndrome (BLM mutation) who was not germline tested. Average age at diagnosis was50 (range: 27-77), and 65% had no personal cancer history. The majority (79%) of tumors were grade 1-2. 35% were either lobular or ductal with lobular features.Stromal responses varied from absent to desmoplastic to sclerotic. 69% of caseshad an in situ component. With the exception of a brisk lymphocytic response inBLM and TP53-mutated cancers, lymphocytic infiltration was mild or absent. Insummary, the majority of non-BRCA-related hereditary breast cancers represent thepatient's sentinel malignancy. Lobular features were seen in a subset andhigh-grade, immunogenic carcinomas were uncommon except in the setting of BLM andTP53 mutations. Overall, these findings demonstrate a range of involved genes in non-BRCA mutation carriers with breast cancer and histopathologic heterogeneityin the associated cancers, arguing against use of histomorphology to inform paneltesting algorithms.Copyright Â© 2018.
