Electronic address:jeonguni01@hanmail.net.Many studies have reported that Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) andtumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are related to breast cancer prognosis.However, the clinical significance of ALDH1 and tumor-infiltrating immune cellsin breast cancer has not been fully investigated in patients who receivedneoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). We studied the significance of the expression of ALDH1 and the population of TIL for predicting the prognosis and chemotherapeuticresponse of patients with breast cancer who had received NAC. Forty patients who underwent NAC were enrolled in this study. ALDH1 and TIL (T cells and tumorassociated macrophages) were evaluated before and after NAC. The influences ofALDH1 expression status and TIL populations on both prognosis andchemotherapeutic response were evaluated. ALDH1 positivity was related toestrogen receptor (p = 0.026) and progesterone receptor negativity (p = 0.025).Positive change of ALDH1 after NAC tended to be associated with a poor NACresponse (p = 0.078). Patients with more CD8+ T cells before NAC and fewer CD68(+) macrophages after NAC tended to have better OS, respectively (p = 0.086,p = 0.096). The chemotherapeutic response and prognosis of patients with breastcancer who received NAC are thought to be determined by the tumormicroenvironment. Further research with more patients and a longer study periodis needed.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier GmbH.DOI: 10.1016/j.prp.2018.04.006 PMID: 29685462
