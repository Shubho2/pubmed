The purpose of this prospective,comparative pilot study was to qualitatively explore and code for PCC during the clinical visit of women undergoing BC chemotherapy and compare by race.METHODS: Age-matched Black and White women were recruited. Audio recordings ofclinical visits conducted prior to any cycle (except first) chemotherapy infusionwere obtained and transcribed. Transcripts were blindly reviewed by threeindependent coders assigning PCC scores, ranging from 1 to 5, with lower scoresindicating better PCC. Consensus was reached among reviewers via discussion.RESULTS: Dyads consisted of five Black (mean age 47) and five White (mean age 45)women undergoing BC chemotherapy. Twenty-four recordings were analyzed, 13 White and 11 Black. For all 22 PCC items, the mean scores were worse for Black womenwith significant differences (compared by chi-square analysis) noted for 6/22items (27%).CONCLUSIONS: Qualitatively exploring clinician and patient communication patternsduring the chemotherapy clinical visits informs the understanding of racialdifferences for symptom assessment, reporting, and management. These pilotfindings inform future research exploring racial disparity in cancer treatmentdose intensity.DOI: 10.1007/s40615-018-0503-0 PMID: 29971577
