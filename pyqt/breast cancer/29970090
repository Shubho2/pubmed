Mammography screening has the potential to improve prognosis by reducing stage at diagnosis. Socioeconomic inequalities in mammography cancer screening have been widely reported. The influence of organised programs onsocioeconomic disparities regarding mammography screening is to date unclear. We aimed to investigate the impact of an organised regional screening program onsocioeconomic inequalities in terms of the uptake, knowledge and attitudestowards mammography screening.METHODS: Data were obtained from two cross-sectional surveys of women 50 to69 years old conducted in 1998 and 2012, before and after the implementation ofan organised breast cancer screening program in Geneva, Switzerland.Socioeconomic status was measured by monthly household income and educationlevel. Logistic and linear regression multivariable models were used toinvestigate the evolution of socioeconomic gradients between 1998 and 2012 interms of uptake, knowledge and attitudes towards mammography screening.RESULTS: In 1998, before the implementation of an organised screening program,44% of women from the lowest education category reported mammography practiceconforming to recommendations versus 63% of the more educated participants. This socioeconomic gradient was no longer present in 2012 where reported mammographypractice at guideline-recommended frequency were 83 and 82% in the lowest andhighest education level categories respectively (change in education gradientover time, p = 0.018). The difference in mammography practice in agreement withrecommendations between the lowest and the highest income category went from 27percentage points in 1998 to 14 percentage points in 2012 (change in incomegradient over time, p = 0.10). The socioeconomic gradient in negative attitudestowards mammography screening persisted in 2012 but was reduced compared to 1998.We did not observe a reduction in the socioeconomic disparities in knowledgeregarding mammography screening over this period.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that mammography screening programs may lessensocioeconomic inequities in mammography practice. Such programs should featureadapted communication tools to reach women of lower socioeconomic status toattempt to further reduce socioeconomic gradients in mammography screening.DOI: 10.1186/s12939-018-0811-3 PMCID: PMC6031106PMID: 29970090
