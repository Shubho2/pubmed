For each heterogeneity measure, Cox proportional hazards models wereused to determine whether patients with heterogeneous disease had differentdistant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) than those with homogeneous disease.RESULTS: The presence of heterogeneity in ER percentage staining was prognosticof reduced DRFS with a hazard ratio of 4.26 (95% CI 2.22-8.18, p < 0.00002). Itremained significant after controlling for the ER status itself (p < 0.00062) andfor patients that had chemotherapy (p < 0.00032). Most of the heterogeneitymeasures did not show any association with DRFS despite the considerable samplesize.CONCLUSIONS: Intra-tumor heterogeneity of ER receptor status may be a predictorof patient DRFS. Histopathologic data from multiple tissue samples may offer aview of tumor heterogeneity and assess recurrence risk.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4879-7 PMID: 29992418
