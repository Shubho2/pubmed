Subsequently, protein translationis stopped and stress granules (SGs) are formed. Cancer cells form SGs underhypoxia. SGs accumulate apoptosis-related molecules and play anti-apoptoticroles. Thus, hypoxia-induced SG formation contributes to drug resistance incancer cells. For this reason, inhibition of SG formation is expected to bebeneficial in cancer therapy. To prove this concept, chemical reagents thatinhibit SG formation are required as experimental tools. We searched for chemicalcompounds that suppress SG formation and identified that β-estradiol,progesterone, and stanolone (hereafter described as EPS) inhibit SG formation in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. As it turned out, EPS block PKR but not PERK,thus fail to suppress SG formation in most cancer cells, where SGs are formed viaPERK. Nevertheless, in this study, we used HeLa cells as a model and demonstratedthat EPS block hypoxia-induced SG formation in HeLa cells and consequently reducedrug resistance that HeLa cells acquire under hypoxia. Our findings support that inhibition of SG formation is a useful method to control cancers.DOI: 10.1093/jb/mvy062 PMID: 30020475
