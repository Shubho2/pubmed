We aimed toinvestigate the activity and safety of eribulin in a real-world population ofmetastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients and to identify possible predictivefactors of progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 71 eribulin-treated MBC patients. Bestresponse rate, PFS, and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated. The impact ofdifferent clinical-pathological factors on PFS was evaluated using the Coxproportional hazards model. Predictive factors of response were identified bydiscriminant function analysis (DFA).RESULTS: Median PFS was 3.75 months (95% CI, 2.39-4.48); 12 patients (16.90%)achieved partial response (PR), 27 (38.03%) stable disease. The most common AEswere fatigue (25.83%), neutropenia (16.56%), and peripheral neuropathy (13.91%). A worse performance status (p = 0.025) and a higher number of metastatic organsites (p = 0.011) were associated with a worse PFS under eribulin. Overall, inthe DFA-predictive model, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio at baseline, estrogenreceptor, Ki67, histology, and age were predictive of PR with 100% accuracy.CONCLUSIONS: Activity and safety profiles of eribulin were consistent withliterature data. Performance status and number of metastatic sites werepredictive factors of PFS. DFA could be a promising tool to discriminateresponses to eribulin among MBC patients.© 2018 S.
