Predictive biomarkers are needed to selectpatients who will benefit from the treatment and spare others the toxicity andburden of radiation.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We first trained and tested an intrinsic radiosensitivitygene signature to predict local recurrence after radiotherapy in three cohorts of948 patients. Next, we developed an antigen processing and presentation-basedimmune signature by maximizing the treatment interaction effect in 129 patients. To test their predictive value, we matched patients treated with or withoutradiotherapy in an independent validation cohort for clinicopathologic factorsincluding age, ER status, HER2 status, stage, hormone-therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery. Disease specific survival (DSS) was the primary endpoint.RESULTS: Our validation cohort consisted of 1,439 patients. After matching andstratification by the radiosensitivity signature, patients who receivedradiotherapy had better DSS than patients who did not in the radiation-sensitive group (hazard ratio [HR]=0.68, P=0.059, n=322), while a reverse trend wasobserved in the radiation-resistant group (HR=1.53, P=0.059, n=202). Similarly,patients treated with radiotherapy had significantly better DSS in theimmuneeffective group (HR=0.46, P=0.0076, n=180), with no difference in DSS inthe immunedefective group (HR=1.27, P=0.16, n=348). Both signatures werepredictive of radiotherapy benefit (Pinteraction=0.007 and 0.005). Integration ofradiosensitivity and immune signatures further stratified patients into threegroups with differential outcomes for those treated with or without radiotherapy (Pinteraction=0.003).CONCLUSIONS: The proposed signatures have the potential to select patients whoare most likely to benefit from radiotherapy.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0825 PMID: 29921729
