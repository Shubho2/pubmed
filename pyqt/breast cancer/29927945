The topological parameters (degreedistributions, clustering co-efficient, connectivity and centralities) of thisnetwork obey fractal rules indicating absence of centrality lethality rule, andefficient communication among the components. From the network theoreticalapproach, we identified few key regulators out of large number of leading hubs,which are deeply rooted from top to down of the network, serve as backbone of thenetwork, and possible target genes. However, p53, which is one of these keyregulators, is found to be in low rank and keep itself at low profile butdirectly cross-talks with important genes BRCA2 and BRCA3. The popularity ofthese hubs gets changed in unpredictable way at various levels of organizationthus showing disassortive nature. The local community paradigm approach in thisnetwork shows strong correlation of nodes in majority of modules/sub-modules(fast communication among nodes) and weak correlation of nodes only in fewmodules/sub-modules (slow communication among nodes) at various levels of networkorganization.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198525 PMCID: PMC6013121PMID: 29927945
