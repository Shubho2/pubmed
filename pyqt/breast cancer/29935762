In this study, weshowed for the first time that the receptor tyrosine kinase, AXL, isoverexpressed in various tumor cell lines and patient tumor tissues includingtriple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines and patient samples, making AXL apotent novel target for cancer therapy, specifically for TNBC treatment. We also engineered T cells with a CAR consisting of a novel single-chain variablefragment against AXL and revealed its antigen-specific cytotoxicity and abilityto release cytokines in a TNBC cell line and other AXL-positive tumors in vitro. Furthermore, AXL-CAR-T cells displayed a significant anti-tumor effect and invivo persistence in a TNBC xenograft model. Taken together, our findings indicatethat AXL-CAR-T cells can represent a promising therapeutic strategy against TNBC.Copyright Â© 2018.
