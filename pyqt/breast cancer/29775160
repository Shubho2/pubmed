A tissue microarray was constructed from a total of 126 metastatic breast tumors (31 bone metastases (24.6%), 36 brain metastases (28.6%), 11 liver metastases (8.7%), and 48 lung metastases (38.1%)). Immunohistochemical staining for amineoxidase-related proteins (lysyl oxidase, diamine oxidase, and monoamine oxidase Aand B) was performed. In metastatic breast cancer tissue, lysyl oxidase (p = 0.001), tumoral diamine oxidase ( p = 0.003), stromal diamine oxidase (p = 0.047), and stromal monoamine oxidase B ( p = 0.002) were differentiallyexpressed in different metastatic sites. Bone metastases showed low expression oflysyl oxidase, tumoral diamine oxidase, and stromal diamine oxidase. We observed high expression of lysyl oxidase in brain metastases, tumoral diamine oxidase in liver metastases, stromal diamine oxidase in lung metastases, and stromalmonoamine oxidase B in bone metastases. Lysyl oxidase positivity was associatedwith progesterone receptor negativity ( p = 0.001), and monoamine oxidase Apositivity was associated with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2negativity ( p = 0.003) and the luminal A subtype ( p = 0.003). On univariateanalysis shorter overall survival was associated with stromal diamine oxidasenegativity ( p = 0.008), especially in lung metastases ( p = 0.025), and stromal monoamine oxidase B positivity ( p < 0.001). Stromal monoamine oxidase Bpositivity was an independent prognostic factor for shorter overall survival inmultivariate Cox analysis (hazard ratio, 4.069; 95% confidence interval,1.649-10.04; p = 0.002). Finally, in metastatic breast cancer, amineoxidase-related proteins were differentially expressed in a manner specific tometastatic site, and stromal monoamine oxidase B expression was correlated withprognosis.DOI: 10.1177/1010428318776822 PMID: 29775160  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
