The structures of the target compounds were established onthe basis of their spectral data, IR, 1H NMR, 13 C NMR, 13 C NMR-DEPT/APT, and MSdata. The new compounds have been examined for their anti-proliferative activity against three cancer cell lines, MCF-7, HCT-116, and HepG-2. Vinblastine andDoxorubicin have been used as positive controls in the viability assay. Theobtained results confirmed that most of the tested molecules revealed strong and selective cytotoxic activity against the three cancer cell lines. Moreover, thesemolecules exhibited weak cytotoxicity on the HFL-1 line, which suggested thatthey might be ideal anticancer candidates. The SAR study of the new benzochromenecompounds verified that the substituents on the phenyl ring of1H-benzo[f]chromene nucleus, accompanied with the presence of bromine atom ormethoxy group at the 8-position, increases the ability of these molecules againstthe different cell lines. Due to their high anti-proliferative activity,compounds 4c and 6e were selected to be examined their proficiency to inhibit theinvasiveness of the highly sensitive and invasive breast cancer cell line,MDA-MB-231. The anti-invasion behaviour of these molecules against the highlysensitive, non-oestrogen, and progesterone MDA-MB-231 cell line gave rise totheir decreasing metastatic effect compared to the reference drug. Furthermore,this report explores the apoptotic mechanistic pathway of the cytotoxicity of thetarget compounds and reveals that most of these compounds enhance the Caspase 3/7activity that could be considered as potential anticancer agents.DOI: 10.1080/14756366.2018.1476503 PMCID: PMC6022228PMID: 29923425  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
