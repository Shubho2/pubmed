Theanalytic sample was limited to 538 respondents with unilateral DCIS. We alsosurveyed 761 surgeons and radiation oncologists treating breast cancer in thoseregions, of whom, 539 responded (71%).RESULTS: After BCS, 23% of patients omitted RT, with twice the rate of omissionin Los Angeles County relative to Georgia (31% vs 16%; P < .001). The most commonreasons for omitting RT were advice from a clinician that it was not needed (62%)and concern about side effects (24%). Cost and transportation were not reportedas influential considerations. After covariate adjustment, low- andintermediate-grade disease (odds ratio [OR] 5.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]2.5-12; and OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.7-6.1, respectively) and Los Angeles County SEERsite (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.3-8.2) were significantly associated with greater RTomission. Of the responding clinicians, 62% would discuss RT omission for apatient with DCIS with favorable features. Clinicians in Los Angeles County were more likely to discuss RT omission than were those in Georgia (67% vs 56%;P = .01). Approximately one third of clinicians would obtain the Oncotype DX DCISscore.CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity in RT omission after BCS for DCIS continues to be substantial, with systematic differences in provider opinions across the 2regions we studied. Enhanced precision of recurrence estimates, guidance fromprofessional organizations, and better communication are needed to improve theconsistency of treatment in this controversial area.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
