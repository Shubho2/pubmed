While themechanism of the estrogen effects is not fully elucidated, one possible route is by increasing the stem cell-like properties in the tumors. Tocopherols are known to reduce breast cancer development and progression. The aim of the present studyis to investigate the effects of tocopherols on the regulation of breast cancerstemness mediated by estrogen. To determine the effects of tocopherols onestrogen-influenced breast cancer stem cells, the MCF-7 tumorsphere culturesystem, which enriches for mammary progenitor cells and putative breast cancerstem cells, was utilized. Treatment with estrogen resulted in an increase in the CD44+/CD24- subpopulation and ALDH activity in tumorspheres as well as the numberand size of tumorspheres. Tocopherols inhibited the estrogen-induced expansion ofthe breast cancer stem population. Tocopherols decreased the levels of stem cell markers, including OCT4, CD44 and SOX-2, as well as estrogen-related markers,such as TFF/pS2, CTSD, PGR and SERPINA1, in estrogen-stimulated tumorspheres.Overexpression of OCT4 increased CD44 and SOX2 levels and significantly increasedcell invasion and expression of the invasion markers, matrix metalloproteinases, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase and urokinase plasminogen activator, andtocopherols inhibited these OCT4-mediated effects. These results suggest apotential inhibitory mechanism of tocopherols in estrogen-induced stemness andcell invasion in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1093/carcin/bgy071 PMCID: PMC6067126 [Available on 2019-07-30]PMID: 29846560
