Patients underwent US and MMG at baseline and after NAC. Imageswere evaluated for residual abnormality and to determine modality for IGBx[US-guided (USG) or stereotactic guided (SG)]. Fine-needle aspiration and 9-G,vacuum-assisted core biopsy (VACBx) of tumor bed was performed after NAC and was compared with histopathology at surgery.RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled. Median age was 50.5 (range 26-76) years;median baseline tumor size was 2.4 cm (range 0.8-6.3) and 1 cm (range 0-5.5)after NAC. Nineteen patients had pCR: 6 (32%) had residual Ca2+ presurgery, 5(26%) residual mass, 1 (5%) mass with calcifications, and 7 (37%) no residualimaging abnormality. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of US, MMG, and IGBx for pCR were 47/95/73%, 53/90/73%, and 100/95/98%, respectively. Twenty-five(63%) patients had SGBx and 15 (37%) had US-guided biopsy (USGBx). Median number of cores was higher with SGBx (12, range 6-14) than with USGBx (8, range 4-12),p < 0.002. Positive predictive value for pCR was significantly higher for SGVACBx than for USG VACBx (100 vs. 60%, p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: SG VACBx is the preferred IGBx modality for identifying patientswith pCR for trials testing the safety of eliminating surgery.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6481-y PMID: 29667115
