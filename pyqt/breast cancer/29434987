China.In the past decades, the tricyclic acridone ring system has become a focus ofmajor research by medicinal chemists due to the biological significance of thismoiety in drug design and discovery. Acridone has substantial bio-potential sinceit performs crucial functions, including antibacterial, antimalarial, antiviraland anti-neoplastic activities. However, the anticancer effect and the underlyingmechanisms of acridone on breast cancer cells remains unclear. In the presentstudy, the anti-tumor function and the underlying mechanisms of acridone wereevaluated in vitro. Firstly, an MTT assay was used to evaluate the inhibitoryeffect of acridone. Subsequently, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerasechain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to investigate whether ATP bindingcassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) was associated with the function ofacridone. Finally, western blotting was used to confirm the results of RT-qPCR.The present study demonstrated that acridone may decrease the proliferation ofMDA-MB-231 cells dose-dependently. Further experiments revealed that acridone maydownregulate the mRNA and protein expression levels of ABCG2, supporting thepotential application of acridone in breast cancer treatment. These findingssuggested that acridone is a potential agent in the treatment of human breastcancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7583 PMCID: PMC5777286PMID: 29434987
