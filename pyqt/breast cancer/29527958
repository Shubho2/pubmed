Being a potent suppressor of apoptosis, itserves as a significant link for its association with various types ofmalignancies such as colorectal and breast cancer. To overcome its pathologicalrole in various cancerous diseases, CK-II procures great consideration as atherapeutic target. This study aimed at understanding the binding mechanism andstructural properties of benzimidazole derivatives by utilizing variouscomputational tools including docking simulation, three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationships and molecular dynamic simulation.Structure-based 3D-QSAR techniques such as CoMFA and CoMSIA models, wereestablished from the conformations gained by protein-ligand docking approach. Theattained models have showed a good extrapolative power for internal as well asexternal validation. Moreover, MD simulation was carried out to explain thedetailed binding mechanism and the comparison of inhibitor's binding mode withdiverse biological activities. A good correlation was observed among dockingstudies, MD results, and contour map analysis. Interestingly new molecules weredesigned using detail structural information from MD simulation, showed higherpotency of inhibition (pIC50 7.6-7.7) compare to the most active compound of the series.DOI: 10.1080/07391102.2018.1450166 PMID: 29527958
