Several biosimilar candidates of originator or 'reference' trastuzumab are in development and have used pCR as a primaryendpoint to assess therapeutic equivalence between treatments. The exactdefinition of pCR has varied across studies. Areas covered: Here we look at theclinical relevance of pCR and compare rates of total pCR (defined as ypT0/isypN0) and breast pCR (defined as ypT0/is) in clinical trials of reference andbiosimilar trastuzumab. Expert commentary: In order to evaluate the efficacy ofneoadjuvant systemic therapies in a uniform way, standardization of trialendpoints is necessary. Future studies in HER2-positive breast cancer shouldinclude full assessment of the breast and lymph node basin before and afterneoadjuvant systemic therapy, and the use of total pCR as the primary outcome.DOI: 10.1080/14737140.2018.1457442 PMID: 29580109
