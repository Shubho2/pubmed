However, the temporal evolutionary dynamics that produce tumor subclones remain unknown. Here wemeasure clone dynamics in human cancers by using computational modeling ofsubclonal selection and theoretical population genetics applied tohigh-throughput sequencing data. Our method determined the detectable subclonalarchitecture of tumor samples and simultaneously measured the selective advantageand time of appearance of each subclone. We demonstrate the accuracy of ourapproach and the extent to which evolutionary dynamics are recorded in thegenome. Application of our method to high-depth sequencing data from breast,gastric, blood, colon and lung cancer samples, as well as metastatic deposits,showed that detectable subclones under selection, when present, consistentlyemerged early during tumor growth and had a large fitness advantage (>20%). Ourquantitative framework provides new insight into the evolutionary trajectories ofhuman cancers and facilitates predictive measurements in individual tumors fromwidely available sequencing data.DOI: 10.1038/s41588-018-0128-6 PMID: 29808029
