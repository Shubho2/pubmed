Because there havebeen no studies to evaluate the prognostic significance of TROY, we performed thepresent study to determine whether TROY can be a prognostic biomarker in CRCpatients. We evaluated TROY expression levels in 100 CRC tissues by quantitative real-time PCR and investigated the association of TROY expression levels withclinicopathologic features. Cancer stage and TROY expression level were found to be independent prognostic factors of disease-free survival. Moreover, TROYoverexpression was the sole independent prognostic factor of disease-freesurvival in patients with stage II and III CRC. These results suggest thatanalysis of TROY might help predict clinical outcome in patients with CRC. Tosupport our findings, confirmatory studies using independent data sets areneeded.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8079 PMCID: PMC5844020PMID: 29556315
