[Epub ahead ofprint]Grouped Amorphous Calcifications at Mammography: Frequently Atypical but RarelyAssociated with Aggressive Malignancy.Oligane HC(1), Berg WA(1), Bandos AI(1), Chen SS(1), Sohrabi S(1), Anello M(1),Zuley ML(1).Author information: (1)From the Department of Radiology, Magee-Womens Hospital, University ofPittsburgh Medical Center, 300 Halket St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 (H.C.O., W.A.B.,S.S.C., S.S., M.A., M.L.Z.); Department of Radiology, University of PittsburghSchool of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pa (W.A.B., A.I.B., M.A., M.L.Z.); and Departmentof Biostatistics, University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health,Pittsburgh, Pa (A.I.B.).Purpose To determine rate of malignancy at stereotactic biopsy of amorphouscalcifications with different distributions using current imaging, clinical, and histopathologic criteria. Materials and Methods From January 2009 to September2013, this retrospective study reviewed a large set of stereotactic biopsies toidentify amorphous calcifications and their clinical, imaging, andhistopathologic characteristics. Calcification distribution was correlated withmalignancy rate after adjusting for known risk factors using logistic regression.Results Of 1903 sequential biopsies, 546 (28.7%) were for amorphouscalcifications. After excluding atypical lesions not excised and patients withmore than one biopsy in the same year, 497 lesions from 494 women (median age, 52years; age range, 30-81 years) remained. Fifty-two (10.5%; 95% confidenceinterval [CI]: 7.9, 13.5) lesions proved malignant, with 17 of 52 (42.7%) beinginvasive cancers (median, 0.3 cm; range, 0.1-1.3 cm) and all 17 of them beingestrogen and progesterone receptor positive and node negative. Malignancy ratesin a segmental (six of 21 [28.6%]), linear (eight of 32 [25.0%]), or multiplegroup same quadrant (nine of 36 [25.0%]) distribution were significantly higherthan malignancy rate in a solitary group of amorphous calcifications (25 of 356[7.0%]) (P = .004, P = .003, and P = .002, respectively). Of 356 groupedamorphous calcifications, 102 (28.7%) yielded atypical results promptingexcision, with three of 102 (2.9%) upgraded to ductal carcinoma in situ atexcision. In women younger than 50 years without a personal history of cancer,grouped amorphous calcifications showed four of 127 (3.1%) (95% CI: 0.9, 7.9)were malignant and 39 of 127 (30.7%) were atypical at final histopathology.Conclusion Biopsy of amorphous calcifications remains necessary, with an overall malignancy rate of 10.5%; only 17 of 497 (3.4%) biopsies showed invasive cancer, and all of these were estrogen and progesterone receptor positive. Groupedamorphous calcifications in women younger than 50 years without history of breastor ovarian cancer showed a low malignancy rate of 3.1% (four of 127).Â© RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018172406 PMID: 29916773
