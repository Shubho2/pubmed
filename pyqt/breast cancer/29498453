The primaryobjective of this study was to analyze impact of PTR on survival in metastaticpatients with breast cancer. A retrospective study of metastatic patients withbreast cancer was conducted using the 1988-2011 Surveillance, Epidemiology, andEnd Results (SEER) data base. Cox proportional hazards regression models wereused to evaluate the relationship between PTR and survival and to adjust for the heterogeneity between the groups, and a propensity score-matched analysis wasalso performed. A total of 29 916 patients with metastatic breast cancer wereincluded in the study, and 15 129 (51%) of patients underwent primary tumorresection, and 14 787 (49%) patients did not undergo surgery. Overall, decreasingtrend in PTR for metastatic breast cancer in last decades was noted. Primarytumor resection was associated with a longer median OS (34 vs 18 months). In apropensity score-matched analysis, prognosis was also more favorable in theresected group (P = .0017). Primary tumor resection in metastatic breast cancerwas associated with survival improvement, and the improvement persisted inpropensity-matched analysis.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13005 PMID: 29498453
