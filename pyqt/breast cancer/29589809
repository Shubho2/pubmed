Using the Health Belief Model (HBM) and hierarchical logistic regression with data from a sample of 286 AI female adults residing in theNorthern Plains, we found that greater awareness of breast cancer screening waslinked to breast cancer screening practices. However, perceived barriers, one of the HBM constructs, prevented such screening practices. This study suggested thatculturally relevant HBM factors should be targeted when developing culturallysensitive breast cancer prevention efforts.DOI: 10.1080/00981389.2018.1455789 PMCID: PMC5997550PMID: 29589809
