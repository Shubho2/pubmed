RHAMM has been suggested as a biomarker for poorprognosis in several tumor types, including lung, breast, colorectal, gastric,pancreatic ductal, and ovarian cancers. RNA studies showed restricted RHAMMexpression in normal tissues, but its protein expression data in tissues werelimited. In light of its potential as a prognostic marker and a therapeutictarget, we performed immunohistochemical analysis to systematically characterize RHAMM expression in normal and neoplastic human tissues. Among 29 normal adulttissues, RHAMM protein showed restricted expression and was observed in thethymus, lymph node/tonsil, small intestine, colon, skin, bone marrow, placenta,and testis. The cellular distribution patterns of RHAMM in these normal tissueswere consistent with RHAMM being a G2/M cell cycle protein, and this was further supported in comparison to the expression of cyclin B2, another G2/M protein.However, unlike the subcellular localization of cyclin B2, RHAMM decoratedmitotic spindles in both anaphase and metaphase. RHAMM expression in tumortissues is variable; and higher RHAMM protein expression is associated withhistologically higher-grade tumors in general. Distinct from its expression insomatic tissues, RHAMM showed diffuse, strong, stage-specific expression in thespermatocyte stage of germ cells in adult testis. The neoplastic counterpart,spermatocytic tumor, also showed strong RHAMM expression. This unique expression in testis suggests that RHAMM may function during normal testicular germ cellmaturation.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24939 PMCID: PMC5940366PMID: 29765511
