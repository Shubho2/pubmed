However, the mechanisms and mediators for autocrine CCL2 andCCL2-CCR2 axis remain elusive in breast cancer. Here we examined the levels ofCCL2 in 4 breast cancer cell lines along with 57 human breast cancer specimensand found them significantly increased with presence of 17β-estradiol (E2) inestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells, while anti-estrogentreatment weakened this enhancement. CCL2 expression positively correlated withTwist staining and aggressiveness of breast cancer. Estrogen exposure facilitatedthe proliferation, invasion and metastasis of hormone-dependent breast cancer andpromoted angiogenesis via the increased secretion of CCL2 in vitro and in vivo,which could be suppressed by disruption of CCL2-CCR2 axis with CCR2 antagonistRS102895. Knockdown of Twist in MCF-7 cells significantly inhibited E2-inducedCCL2 production, indicating an essential role of Twist in CCL2 regulation underestrogenic condition. Our data show the hormonal regulation on CCL2-CCR2 axis is associated with enhanced Twist expression via activation of ERα andPI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling. Thus, CCL2-CCR2 axis may represent as a noveltherapeutic target eagerly needed for hormone-dependent breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27810-6 PMCID: PMC6015029PMID: 29934505
