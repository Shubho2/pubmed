Electronic address: rhv@upenn.edu.Pancreatic cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer mortality in the USA,recently surpassing breast cancer. A key component of pancreatic cancer'slethality is its acquired immune privilege, which is driven by animmunosuppressive microenvironment, poor T cell infiltration, and a lowmutational burden. Although immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockade orengineered T cells have yet to demonstrate efficacy, a growing body of evidencesuggests that orthogonal combinations of these and other strategies could unlock immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer. In this Review article, we discuss promising immunotherapies currently under investigation in pancreatic cancer and provide a roadmap for the development of prevention vaccines for this and other cancers.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
