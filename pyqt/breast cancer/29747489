We found a change in risk-reducing (RR) management patterns after December 2012, when the National Health Insurance System (NHIS) of Koreabegan to pay for BRCA testing and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) inpathogenic-variant carriers.Materials and Methods: The study group consisted of 992 patients, including 705with breast cancer (BC), 23 with ovarian cancer (OC), 10 with both, and 254relatives of high-risk patients who underwent BRCA testing at the National CancerCenter of Korea from January 2008 to December 2016.We analyzed patterns of andfactors in RR management.Results: Of the 992 patients, 220 (22.2%) were carriers of BRCA pathogenicvariants. About 92.3% (203/220) had a family history of BC and/or OC, whichsignificantly differed between BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers (p<0.001). All 41 malecarriers chose surveillance. Of the 179 female carriers, 59 (71.1%) of the 83carriers with BC and the 39 (49.4%) of 79 unaffected carriers underwent RRmanagement. None of the carriers affected with OC underwent RR management. Of themanagement types, RRSO had the highest rate (42.5%) of patient choice. The rateof risk-reducing surgery was significantly higher after 2013 than before 2013(46.3% [74/160] vs. 31.6% [6/19], p<0.001).Conclusion: RRSO was the preferred management for carriers of BRCA pathogenicvariants. The most important factors in treatment choice were NHIS reimbursement and/or the severity of illness.DOI: 10.4143/crt.2018.079 PMID: 29747489
