A second questionnaire at six months queried use during treatment.Supplement use was evaluated in relation to CIPN, assessed via the NationalCancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v. 3.0)and the self-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/GynecologicOncology Group Neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-Ntx) subscale. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95%confidence intervals (CIs) were computed with logistic regression for the CTCAEanalyses and ordinal regression for the FACT/GOG-Ntx analyses.Results: Multivitamin use before diagnosis was associated with reduced symptomsof CIPN (CTCAE-adjusted OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.42 to 0.87; FACT/GOG-Ntx-adjustedOR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.61 to 1.00). Use during treatment was marginally inversely associated with CIPN (CTCAE-adjusted OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.49 to 1.08;FACT/GOG-Ntx-adjusted OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.99). Other supplement use,either before diagnosis or during treatment, was not statistically significantly associated with CIPN.Conclusions: Multivitamin use may be associated with reduced risk of CIPN,although individual dietary supplement use did not appreciably affect risk.Multivitamin use could be a surrogate for other related behaviors that are theactual drivers of the association with reduced CIPN. Without prospectiverandomized trials of vitamin supplementation, recommendations for use or changes to clinical practice are clearly not warranted.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djx098 PMCID: PMC6075365 [Available on 2018-09-01]PMID: 29546345
