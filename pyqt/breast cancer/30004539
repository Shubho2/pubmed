Amongpatients and across different breast cancer subtypes, the response to radiationis heterogeneous. Radiation-induced biochemical changes were examined by Ramanspectroscopy using cell lines that represent a spectrum of human breast cancer.Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminantanalysis (PLSDA) revealed unique Raman spectral features in the HER2 and Ki67subtype. The changes in Raman spectral profiles to different doses of radiation(0-50 Gy) included variations in the levels of proteins, lipids, nucleic acidsand glycogen. Importantly, the differences in radiation-induced changes on thenormal breast epithelial cell line MCF10A could be discriminated within andacross the various breast tumor cell lines. These results demonstrate a novelapproach to uncover differences between breast cancer cell subtypes andsurrounding normal tissues by their biochemical variations in response toradiation.DOI: 10.1039/c8an00345a PMID: 30004539
