Therefore, we focused on pCAF and GCN5 because they both acetylatedBRCA1 without affecting BRCA1 expression. Further analysis indicated that theacetylated form of BRCA1 is deacetylated by wild-type (WT) SIRT1, but notdeacetylase mutant SIRT1, suggesting that SIRT1 is a specific deacetylase ofBRCA1. We demonstrated that lysine 830 of BRCA1 is a preferential acetylationsite by pCAF and tested its function in embryonic stem (ES) cells by changinglysine 830 to arginine using a transcription activator-like effector nuclease(TALEN) system. After exposure to DNA damage-inducing UV radiation, the viabilityof BRCA1 K830R mutant cells is greater than the WT ES cells. Further analysisusing additional cell lines indicated that the BRCA1 K830R mutation impairs theintra-S checkpoint. Also, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) phosphorylation was less in K830R cells as compared with WT cells after UV exposure. These data suggest that acetylation of BRCA1 on lysine 830 activates BRCA1 function at the intra-Scheckpoint after DNA damage.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0127-1 PMID: 29440709
