Moreover, cytotoxicityactivity of the complex was studied against breast cancer cell line of MDA MB231 using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.The Pt(II)-complex has a strong ability to quench the intrinsic fluorescence ofHSA through a static quenching mechanism. According fluorescence quenching data, the binding parameters of the interaction were calculated and showed thathydrophobic interaction has an important role. The molecular docking results incoherent with fluorescence measurements illustrated that Pt(II) complex can bind to HSA at one position that located in the hydrophobic cavity of groove betweendrug site I and II. Also, experimental data on driving force in binding site was confirmed whereas theoretical results demonstrated Pt(II) complexinteract to HSA by hydrophobic interaction. Far-UV-CD results showed that Pt(II)-complex induced an increasing in the content of Î±-helical structure of the protein and stabilizedit. Also, MTT assay represented growth inhibitory effect of the complex towardthe breast cancer cell line.DOI: 10.1007/s10895-018-2216-5 PMID: 29476398
