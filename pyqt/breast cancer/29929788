Electronic address:daniela.taverna@unito.it.We previously demonstrated that miR-214 is upregulated in malignant melanomas andtriple-negative breast tumors and promotes metastatic dissemination by affecting a complex pathway including the anti-metastatic miR-148b. Importantly, tumordissemination could be reduced by blocking miR-214 function or increasingmiR-148b expression or by simultaneous interventions. Based on this evidence,with the intent to explore the role of miR-214 as a target for therapy, weevaluated the capability of new chemically modified anti-miR-214, R97/R98, toinhibit miR-214 coordinated metastatic traits. Relevantly, when melanoma orbreast cancer cells were transfected with R97/R98, anti-miR-214 reduced miR-214expression and impaired transendothelial migration were observed. Noteworthy,when the same cells were injected in the tail vein of mice, cell extravasationand metastatic nodule formation in lungs were strongly reduced. Thus, suggesting that R97/R98 anti-miR-214 oligonucleotides were able to inhibit tumor cellescaping through the endothelium. More importantly, when R97/R98 anti-miR-214compounds were systemically delivered to mice carrying melanomas or breast orneuroendocrine pancreatic cancers, a reduced number of circulating tumor cellsand lung or lymph node metastasis formation were detected. Similar results werealso obtained when AAV8-miR-214 sponges were used in neuroendocrine pancreatictumors. Based on this evidence, we propose miR-214 as a promising target foranti-metastatic therapies.Copyright © 2018 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy. Published byElsevier Inc.
