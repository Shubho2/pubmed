Prior to programme expansion womenaged 50 to 64 were invited for screening under the national cancer screeningprogramme in England and Wales whereas women in the 65 to 70 age cohort couldelect to be screened by personally organising a screen. This will give a deeperinsight into the nature of inequality in screening and the impact of policiesaimed at widening the access related to age on inequality of uptake.METHODS: Taking advantage of this natural experiment, inequality is quantifiedacross the different age cohorts and time periods with the use of concentrationindices (CI). Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, information on screening attendance, equivalised household income and age was taken for thethree years prior to the programme expansion and the three years immediatelyfollowing the policy change.RESULTS: Results show that following the expansion, inequality significantlyreduced for the 50-64 age group, prior to the expansion there was a pro-richinequality in screening uptake. There is also evidence of a reduction in incomeinequality in screening uptake among those aged 65 to 70 and an increase in thenumber of women attending screening from this older age cohort.CONCLUSIONS: This indicates that an organised breast screening programme islikely to reduce income related inequality over a screening programme where womenmust organise their own screen. This is important when breast screening is one ofthe main methods used to detect breast cancer at an earlier stage which improves outcomes for women and reduces treatment costs.DOI: 10.1186/s12889-018-5139-9 PMCID: PMC5813398PMID: 29444642  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
