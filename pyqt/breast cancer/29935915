Electronic address:richard.wahl@med.uni-tuebingen.de.Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) causes a variety of thyroidal andnon-thyroidal effects, the best known being the feedback regulation of thyroidhormone levels. This was employed in the TRH stimulation test, which is currentlylittle used. The role of TRH as a cancer biomarker is minor, but exaggeratedresponses to TSH and prolactin levels in breast cancer led to the hypothesis of apotential role for TRH in the pathogenesis of this disease. TRH is a rapidlydegraded peptide with multiple targets, limiting its suitability as a biomarkerand drug candidate. Although some studies reported efficacy in neural diseases(depression, spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.),therapeutic use of TRH is presently restricted to spinocerebellar degenerativedisease. Regulation of TRH production in the hypothalamus, patterns of expressionof TRH and its receptor in the body, its role in energy metabolism and inprolactin secretion are addressed in this review.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
