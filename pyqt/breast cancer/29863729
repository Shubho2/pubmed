The SNR of spectra obtainedfrom portable Raman spectrometers is low, which makes classification moredifficult. A classification algorithm with a high recognition rate is required.In this paper, an algorithm of entropy weighted local-hyperplanek-nearest-neighbor (EWHK) is proposed for the identification of the spectra. Whencalculating the weighted distance between the prediction and the samplehyperplane, EWHK introduces the information entropy weighting to improve thealgorithm of adaptive weighted k-local hyperplane (AWKH). It can reflect all ofthe sample information in the classification objectively and improve theclassification accuracy. The breast cancer detection experimental results of EWHKshowed a significant improvement compared with those of AWKH and k-nearestneighbor (KNN). The EWHK classifier yielded an average diagnostic accuracy of92.33%, a sensitivity of 93.81%, a specificity of 87.77%, a positive predictionrate of 95.99% and a negative prediction rate of 83.69% during randomizedgrouping validation. The algorithm is effective for cancer diagnosis.DOI: 10.1039/c8an00189h PMID: 29863729
