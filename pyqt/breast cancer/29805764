The aim of this paper was to investigate the role of familyhistory of cancer in first degree relatives in prostate cancer risk.Results: As expected, a family history of prostate cancer in first-degreerelatives was more frequent in cases than in controls (OR 3.10, 95% CI2.32-4.15). A family history of early BCa (before age 50) in first-degreerelatives was more frequent in cases than in controls (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.09-2.94)with higher risk of aggressive PCa. The association was more pronounced for BCain daughters (OR 15.26 95% CI 1.95-120).Conclusions: In summary, a family history of BCa in first degree relatives beforeage 50 may increases the risk of PCa with higher Gleason score. This findingcould suggest a specific prostate surveillance and/or genetic counselling for menwho present such familial history.Methods: EPIdemiological study of Prostate CAncer (EPICAP) is a population-based case-control study specifically designed to investigate the role of environmentaland genetic factors in prostate cancer. Detailed information on family history ofcancer in first degree relatives (parents, brothers and sisters, children) wascollected as well as the age of occurrence and the localization of each cancer.Overall, 819 cases and 879 controls have been included.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25320 PMCID: PMC5955101PMID: 29805764
