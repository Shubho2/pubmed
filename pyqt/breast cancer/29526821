Electronic address:arindam19@yahoo.com.The multifunctional cytokine TGF-β crucially participates in breast cancer (BCa) metastasis and works differently in the disease stages, thus contributing in BCa progression. We address connections between TGF-β and the stem cell-relatedtranscription factor (TF) Oct4 in BCa. In 147 BCa patients with infiltrating ductcarcinoma, we identified a significantly higher number of cases with bothmoderate/high Oct4 expression and high TGF-β in late stages compared to earlystages of the disease. In vitro studies showed that TGF-β elevated Oct4expression, which in turn, regulated Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition(EMT)-regulatory gene (Snail and Slug) expression, migratory ability, chemotacticinvasiveness and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation potential of BCa cells.Putative binding sites for Oct4 on the snail, slug and cxcl13 promoters and forSmad3 on the snail and slug promoters were identified. Promoter activities ofsnail and slug were greater in dual-treated cells than only TGF-β-treated orOct4-overexpressing cells. CXCL13 mRNA fold changes, however, were low in cellsinduced with TGF-β, compared to dual-treated or Oct4-overexpressing cells. Ourco-IP studies confirmed that Oct4 and Smad3 form heterodimers that recognizespecific promoter sequences to promote Snail and Slug expression, but which inturn, indirectly inhibits Smad3-mediated repression of CXCL13 expression,allowing Oct4 to act as a positive TF for CXCL13. Taken together, these datasuggest that TGF-β signaling and Oct4 cooperate to induce expression ofEMT-related genes Snail, Slug and CXCL13, which accelerates disease progression, particularly in the late stages, and may indicate a poor prognosis for BCapatients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
