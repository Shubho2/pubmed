Here, we investigated the phenotypiccharacteristics and landscape of somatic genetic alterations in 24 BCs from ATMgermline mutation carriers by whole-exome and targeted sequencing. ATM-associatedBCs were consistently hormone receptor positive and largely displayed minimalimmune infiltrate. Although 79.2% of these tumors exhibited loss ofheterozygosity of the ATM wild-type allele, none displayed high activity ofmutational signature 3 associated with defective homologous recombination DNA(HRD) repair. No TP53 mutations were found in the ATM-associated BCs. Analysis ofan independent data set confirmed that germline ATM variants and TP53 somaticmutations are mutually exclusive. Our findings indicate that ATM-associated BCsoften harbor bi-allelic inactivation of ATM, are phenotypically distinct fromBRCA1/2-associated BCs, lack HRD-related mutational signatures, and that TP53 andATM genetic alterations are likely epistatic.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy028 PMID: 29506079
