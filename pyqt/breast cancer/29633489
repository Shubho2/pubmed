Serial mediation models interrogated theeffect of stressful life events (List of Threatening Experiences-Modified)mediated by appraisal and coping (Perceived Stress Scale and Connor-DavidsonResilience Scale), on symptoms of anxiety and depression (Zung Self-ratingAnxiety Scale and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale).RESULTS: Over one-quarter (30.2%) of participants reported 1 or more stressfullife events, other than their cancer, in the previous 6 months. Results indicate that perceived stress fully mediated the relationships between life stress,anxiety (indirect effect = 0.09, Bias-corrected bootstrap 95% CI 0.02-0.18,Percent mediation = 0.51), and depressive symptoms (indirect effect = 0.11,Bias-corrected bootstrap 95% CI 0.02-0.23, Percent mediation = 0.71) andaccounted for more than half of the relationship between predictor and outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that stress appraisal mediated the relationshipbetween past life stressors and anxiety and depressive symptoms. This analysisalso highlights the need to consider wellness within a broader care context toidentify potentially vulnerable patients to possibly avert future healthconcerns.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4728 PMID: 29633489
