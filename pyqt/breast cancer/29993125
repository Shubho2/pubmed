The objective wasto evaluate a best-practice algorithm with the aim of improving management ofmastitis and breast abscesses across a multisite NHS Trust. The focus was onuniformity of antibiotic prescribing, ultrasound assessment, admission rates,length of hospital stay, intervention by aspiration or incision and drainage, andspecialist follow-up.METHODS: Management was initially evaluated in a retrospective cohort (phase I)and subsequently compared with that in two prospective cohorts after introductionof a breast abscess and mastitis pathway. One prospective cohort was analysedimmediately after introduction of the pathway (phase II), and the second was usedto assess the sustainability of the quality improvements (phase III). The overallimpact of the pathway was assessed by comparing data from phase I with combineddata from phases II and III; results from phases II and III were compared tojudge sustainability.RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were included in phase I, 61 in phase II and 80 in phase III. The management pathway and referral pro forma improved compliance withantibiotic guidelines from 34 per cent to 58·2 per cent overall (phases II andIII) after implementation (P = 0·003). The improvement was maintained betweenphases II and III (54 and 61 per cent respectively; P = 0·684). Ultrasoundassessment increased from 38 to 77·3 per cent overall (P < 0·001), in a sustainedmanner (75 and 79 per cent in phases II and III respectively; P = 0·894).Reductions in rates of incision and drainage (from 8 to 0·7 per cent overall;P = 0·007) were maintained (0 per cent in phase II versus 1 per cent in phaseIII; P = 0·381). Specialist follow-up improved consistently from 43 to 95·7 percent overall (P < 0·001), 92 per cent in phase II and 99 per cent in phase III(P = 0·120). Rates of hospital admission and median length of stay were notsignificantly reduced after implementation of the pathway.CONCLUSION: A standardized approach to mastitis and breast abscess reducedundesirable practice variation, with sustained improvements in process andpatient outcomes.© 2018 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/bjs.10919 PMID: 29993125
