A cumulative invitro release study was performed in physiological phosphate buffer solution atdifferent pH (5.3, 6.5 and 7.4) using a dialysis method. Cytotoxicity andapoptosis assays were performed on MDA-MB-231, NCI/ADR-RES, 2008 C13, CP-70 andSKOV-3 cell lines using CellTiter® Blue. Quantitative and qualitative cell uptakewas studied using fluorescent probe, coumarin-6 (C-6).RESULTS: The drug release form TZNE nanoemulsion was slow and sustained for 24 h.Cytotoxicity and apoptosis were found to be concentration-dependent. Thehalf-maximal inhibitory concentration of TZNE was 0.4852 and 1.35, 11.757 and0.4696, and 1.169 and 0.7235 μM in MDA-MB-231, SKOV-3 and NCI/ADR-RES cells with 48 and 72 h incubation, respectively. Cellular uptake studies using fluorescentprobe, coumarin-6 C-6, showed higher cellular uptake of TNZE compared with freeC6. Results suggest that nanoemulsion could provide a new platform for systemicdelivery of talazoparib.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12753 PMID: 30061215  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
