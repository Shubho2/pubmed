MELK over-expression isassociated with aggressive disease, and MELK has been implicated in numerouscancer-related processes, including chemotherapy resistance, stem cell renewal,and tumor growth. Previously, we established that triple-negative breast cancercell lines harboring CRISPR/Cas9-induced null mutations in MELK proliferate atwild-type levels in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al.,2017</xref>). Here, we generate several additional knockout clones of MELK anddemonstrate that across cancer types, cells lacking MELK exhibit wild-type growthin vitro, under environmental stress, in the presence of cytotoxicchemotherapies, and in vivo. By combining our MELK-knockout clones with arecently described, highly specific MELK inhibitor, we further demonstrate thatthe acute inhibition of MELK results in no specific anti-proliferative phenotype.Analysis of gene expression data from cohorts of cancer patients identifies MELK expression as a correlate of tumor mitotic activity, explaining its associationwith poor clinical prognosis. In total, our results demonstrate the power ofCRISPR/Cas9-based genetic approaches to investigate cancer drug targets, and callinto question the rationale for treating patients with anti-MELK monotherapies.Â© 2018, Giuliano et al.DOI: 10.7554/eLife.32838 PMCID: PMC5805410PMID: 29417930
