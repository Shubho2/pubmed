We aimed to develop a radiolabeled tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) forHER2 targeted breast cancer imaging. In this study, a radioiodinated analog(125/131I-IBA-CP) of the HER2 selective inhibitor CP724,714 was prepared andevaluated in HER2 positive or negative subcutaneous human breast cancerxenografts. Methods: The CP724,714 analog IBA-CP was synthesized and assayed for its inhibitory activities against HER2 and six other tyrosine kinases.125/131I-IBA-CP was prepared using a copper-mediated radioiodination method with enhanced labeling yield and molar activity. In vitro biological activities,including specific and nonspecific binding of 131I-IBA-CP to its HER2 kinasetarget were assessed in different cell lines. In vivo microSPECT imaging with125I-IBA-CP and biodistribution studies were conducted in mice bearingHER2-positive, HER2-negative or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive tumors. Nonradioactive IBA-CP and the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib were employed asblocking agents to investigate the binding specificity and selectivity of125/131I-IBA-CP toward HER2 in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, 125/131I-ICP was prepared by direct radioiodination of CP724,714 for comparison with125/131I-IBA-CP. Results: IBA-CP displayed good in vitro inhibitory activity(IC50 = 16 nM) and selectivity for HER2 over six other cancer-related tyrosinekinases. 125/131I-IBA-CP was prepared in a typical radiochemical yield of about65% (decay-corrected), radiochemical purity of >98%, and molar activity of 42GBq/μmol at the end of synthesis. SPECT imaging revealed significantly higheruptake of 125I-IBA-CP than 125I-ICP in the HER2-positive MDA-MB-453 tumor. Uptakein the HER2-negative MCF-7 tumor was much lower. Binding of 125I-IBA-CP in theMDA-MB-453 tumor was blocked by co-injection with an excess amount of IBA-CP, butnot by erlotinib. Conclusion: The radiolabeled HER2 selective inhibitor125/131I-IBA-CP is a promising probe for in vivo detection of HER2-positivetumors.Copyright © 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.117.205088 PMID: 29653973
