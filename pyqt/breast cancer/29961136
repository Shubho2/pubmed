Casesconsisted of all patients who were aged 20 years and older, and had a first-time diagnosis of breast cancer for the period between 2001 and 2011. The controlswere matched to the cases by age, sex, year, and month of diagnosis. Adjusted oddratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by a conditionallogistic regression.RESULTS: We examined 65,491 breast cancer cases and 261,964 controls. We foundthat use of levothyroxine was associated with a significant increase in breastcancer risk (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.15-1.33; P < 0.001). Compared with no uselevothyroxine, the adjusted odd ratio was 1.22 (95% CI 1.11-1.35; P = 0.01) forthe group having been prescribed levothyroxine 2 months to 1 year, and 1.26 (95% CI 1.12-1.41; P < 0.01) for the group with more than 1 year. When stratified byage, the adjusted odd ratio was 1.45 (95% CI 1.23-1.71; P < 0.01) for thepatients aged 65 years or more and 1.19 (95% CI 1.09-1.29, P < 0.01) for thepatients aged less than 65 years.CONCLUSION: The results of the present study are the first to suggest thatlevothyroxine use increased the risk of breast cancer. However, a largerlong-term prospective randomized-controlled trial specifically designed to assessthe effect of levothyroxine use on the risk of developing breast cancer isneeded.DOI: 10.1007/s00404-018-4837-y PMID: 29961136
