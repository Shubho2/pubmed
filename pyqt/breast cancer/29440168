The data on FOXO function, particularly for epithelial cancers, arefragmentary and come from studies that focused on isolated aspects of cancer. To clarify the role of FOXO in epithelial cancer progression, we characterized theeffects of inducible FOXO activation and loss in a mouse model of metastaticinvasive lobular carcinoma. Strikingly, either activation or loss of FOXOfunction suppressed tumor growth and metastasis. We show that the multitude ofcellular processes critically affected by FOXO function include proliferation,survival, redox homeostasis, and PI3K signaling, all of which must be carefullybalanced for tumor cells to thrive.Significance: FOXO proteins are not solelytumor suppressors, but also support tumor growth and metastasis by regulating amultitude of cellular processes essential for tumorigenesis.
