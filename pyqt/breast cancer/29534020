To improve the current therapy and overcome the resistance of TNBC,there is unmet need to develop an effective targeted therapy. In this regard, oneof the logical and economical approaches is to develop a tumor hypoxia-targeting drug formulation platform for selective delivery of payload to the drug-resistantand invasive cell population of TNBC tumors. Toward this, we developed a CarbonicAnhydrase IX (CA IX) receptor targeting human serum albumin (HSA) carriers todeliver the potent anticancer drug, Paclitaxel (PTX). We used Acetazolamide(ATZ), a small molecule ligand of CA IX to selectively deliver HSA-PTX in TNBCcells. A novel method of synthesis involving copper free 'click' chemistry(Dibenzocyclooctyl, DBCO) moiety with an azide-labeled reaction partner, known asStrain-Promoted Alkyne Azide Cycloaddition (SPAAC) along with a desolvationmethod for PTX loading were used in the present study to arrive at the CA IXselective nano-carriers, HSA-PTX-ATZ. The anticancer effect of HSA-PTX-ATZ ishigher compared to HSA, PTX and non-targeted HSA-PTX in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468cells. The cell killing effect is associated with induction of early and latephases of apoptosis. Overall, our proof-of-concept study shows a promising avenuefor hypoxia-targeted drug delivery that can be adapted to several types ofcancers.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19030838 PMCID: PMC5877699PMID: 29534020
