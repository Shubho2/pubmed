In vitro analyses suggested that intercalating DNA or inhibiting topoisomerase mightcontribute to the cytotoxic effect of this class of compound. However, this idea has not been rigorously tested in intact cells. By synthesizing novelderivatives, here we demonstrate that harmines did not activate the DNA damageresponse, a cellular signaling commonly induced by agents that intercalate DNA orinhibit topoisomerase. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than DNAintercalating or topoisomerase inhibiting contribute to the toxicity of harmines in vivo. Using a novel N2-benzyl and N9-arylated alkyl compound 10f that has goodsolubility and stability as the model, we show that harmines strongly inhibitedthe growth of cancer cells originated from breast, lung, bone and pancreas, butnot that of normal fibroblasts. We further show that 10f induced apoptosis andinhibited autophagy in a dose and time-dependent manner. An apoptosis inhibitorsuppressed 10f-induced cell death. Together, our results reveal previouslyunidentified insights into the anticancer mechanism of harmines, supportingfuture development of this compound class in the treatment of human cancers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
