The purpose of this study is to investigatethe role of CNTN1 in regulating tumor growth, migration and invasion in breastcancer.RESULTS: To investigate its function, CNTN1 was expressed in Hs578T cells. CNTN1 expression was confirmed by western blot, immunohistochemistry and real-timeRT-PCR. The effect of CNTN1 overexpression on proliferation, migration andinvasion of Hs578T breast cancer cells was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Ourresults showed that CNTN1 overexpression promoted Hs578T cell proliferation, cellcycle progression, colony formation, invasion and migration. Notably,overexpression of CNTN1 in Hs578T cells enhanced the growth of mouse xenografttumors.CONCLUSIONS: CNTN1 promotes growth, metastasis and invasion of Hs578T breastcancer cell line. Thus, therapies targeting CNTN1 may prove efficacious forbreast cancer. However, further investigation is required to understand themechanism by which CNTN1 influences proliferation, metastasis and invasion inbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12860-018-0154-3 PMCID: PMC5907708PMID: 29673312
