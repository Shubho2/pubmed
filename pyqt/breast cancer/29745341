Turkey.In an effort to develop potent anticancer agents, the synthesis of a series ofbenzothiazole-based 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives (1-14) was described and their cytotoxic effects on A549 human lung adenocarcinoma, MCF-7 human breastadenocarcinoma, HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma and NIH/3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines were investigated using MTT assay. Phenyl-substitutedcompounds (8-14) were found to be more effective than naphthyl-substitutedcompounds (1-7) on cancer cells. Compounds 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 wereidentified as the most potent anticancer agents on MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lines andtherefore their effects on DNA synthesis and apoptotic/necrotic cell death inMCF-7 cell line were evaluated. Among these compounds,N-(6-methoxybenzothiazol-2-yl)-2-[(5-(phenylamino)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)thio]acetamide (13) was the most selective anticancer agent against MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lines with a SI value of 100. On the other hand, compounds 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and14 inhibited DNA synthesis in MCF-7 cell line in a dose-dependent manner. Flowcytometric analyses clearly indicated that the compounds showed significantanticancer activity against MCF-7 cell line via the induction of apoptosis dosedependently.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1871520618666180509111351 PMID: 29745341
