Participants were followed for up to 5 years. Women diagnosed with breast cancer metastases within a period of 6 months and before the end offollow-up were matched (1:1) by age, index year, physician, type of hormonaltherapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) and follow-up time (in months) withwomen without metastases. Regression analyses were conducted to study theassociation between sleep disorders and the presence of metastases, and theseregression analyses were adjusted for depression.RESULTS: A total of 11,412 women were included in the present study. The mean agewas 59.8 years (SD 11.4 years) and most participants were between 61 and 70 yearsold (metastases group: 32.6%; no-metastases group: 32.3%). Sleep disorders wereassociated with a significant increase in the presence of breast cancermetastases in the overall population (odds ratio [OR] 1.31) and in the different age subgroups (ORs between 1.24 and 1.43).CONCLUSION: A positive association was found between sleep disorders and thepresence of metastases in women diagnosed with breast cancer in gynecologicalpractices in Germany.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4831-x PMID: 29845476
