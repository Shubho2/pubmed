To date, theES has not been used nor evaluated in the clinical cancer genetics setting. Wecreated and implemented an ES to inform the design of a quality improvement (QI) project to increase the rates of adherence to national guidelines for cancergenetic counseling and genetic testing at three unique oncology care settings(OCS). The ES collected qualitative and quantitative data from reviews ofinternal processes, past QI efforts, the literature, and each OCS. The ES used a data collection form and semi-structured interviews to aid in data collection.The ES was completed within 6 months, and sufficient data were captured toidentify opportunities and threats to the QI project's success, as well aspotential barriers to, and facilitators of guideline-based cancer geneticsservices at each OCS. Previously unreported barriers were identified, includinginefficient genetic counseling appointment scheduling processes and the inabilityto track referrals, genetics appointments, and genetic test results withinelectronic medical record systems. The ES was a valuable process for QI projectplanning at three OCS and may be used to evaluate genetics services in othersettings.DOI: 10.1007/s10897-018-0262-4 PMID: 29770910
