Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center,Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.Purpose: Post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) yields improvements in bothlocoregional control and overall survival (OS) for women with T1-2 N1 breastcancer. The value of PMRT in this population has been questioned given advancesin systemic therapy. The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay was evaluated as apredictor of OS among women with T1-2 N1 breast cancer who received or did notreceive PMRT.Experimental Design: An observational cohort study was performed on women with T1-2 N1 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer from the NationalCancer Database (NCDB) and, as a validation cohort, from the surveillance,epidemiology, and end results (SEER) registry who underwent mastectomy and wereevaluated for RS. Multivariable parametric accelerated failure time models wereused to estimate associations of RS and PMRT with OS using propensityscore-adjusted matched cohorts.Results: In both the NCDB (N = 7,332) and SEER (N = 3,087) cohorts, there was a significant interaction of RS and PMRT with OS (P =0.009 and P = 0.03, respectively). PMRT was associated with longer OS in womenwith a low RS [NCDB: time ratio (TR) = 1.70; 95% CI (confidence interval),1.30-2.22; P < 0.001; SEER: TR = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.33-2.57; P < 0.001], but not in women with an intermediate RS (NCDB: TR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.69-1.14; P = 0.35;SEER: TR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.62-1.14; P = 0.26), or a high RS (NCDB: TR = 1.10; 95%CI, 0.91-1.34; P = 0.33; SEER: TR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.50-1.23; P =0.28).Conclusions: Longer survival associated with PMRT was limited to women witha low RS. PMRT may confer the greatest OS benefit for patients at the lowest riskof distant recurrence. These results caution against omission of PMRT among womenwith low RS.
