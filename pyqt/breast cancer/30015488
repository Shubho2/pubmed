Compounds were subjected to cancer-focusedphenotypic cell viability and migration assays and orthogonal target-basedpharmacological screening platforms to identify their protease and GPCRmodulatory activity profiles. The cancer related serine protease kallikrein 7(KLK7) was inhibited to similar extents with an IC50 near 20 μM by bothrepresentative members 1 and 4, which differed in the presence or lack of theN-terminal unit. In contrast to the biochemical protease profiling study, clearSAR was observed in the functional GPCR screens, where five GPCRs in antagonistmode (CCR10, OXTR, SSTR3, TACR2) and agonist mode (CXCR7) were modulated bycompounds 1-7 to varying extents. Chemokine receptor type 10 (CCR10) was potentlymodulated by brintonamide D (4) with an IC50 of 0.44 μM. We performed in silicomodeling to understand the structural basis underlying the differences in theantagonistic activity among brintonamides toward CCR10. Because of thesignificance of KLK7 and CCR10 in cancer progression and metastasis, wedemonstrated the ability of brintonamide D (4) at 10 μM to significantly targetdownstream cellular substrates of KLK7 (Dsg-2 and E-cad) in vitro and to inhibit CCL27-induced CCR10-mediated proliferation and the migration of highly invasivebreast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00885 PMID: 30015488
