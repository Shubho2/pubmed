A large number of pathways reported that govern the apoptotic evasion have been reported. Fas-activatedserine/threonine kinase (FASTK) is a member of Ser/Thr kinase family, and it has been implicated in the apoptotic evasion and, hence, the development of cancer.Keeping this in view, a series of novel thienopyrimidine-based chalcones havebeen synthesized and evaluated to modulate the FASTK mediated apoptotic evasion. Initial screening was done by enzyme inhibition assay and binding studies, which showed that out of 15 synthesized compounds, 3 thienopyrimidine-based chalconederivatives possess considerably high binding affinity and enzyme inhibitorypotential (nM range) for FASTK. Cell proliferation assessment of selectedcompounds was performed on HEK-293 and MCF-7 cells. For MCF-7 cells, compounds 2,10, and 12 show IC50 values of 20.22 ± 1.50, 6.52 ± 0.82, and 8.20 ± 0.61 μM,respectively. Annexin-V and PI staining suggested that these molecules induceapoptosis in MCF-7 cells, arrest the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, andsubsequently inhibit cell migration presumably by inhibiting FASTK and reactiveoxygen species production. In conclusion, we have successfully designed,synthesized, and characterized thienopyrimidine-based chalcones that inhibitFASTK and induce apoptosis. These compounds may be exploited as potentialanticancer agents.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00566 PMID: 30040903
