Prognostic factors for contralateralbreast cancer (CBC) are also not well established. We aimed to investigate thesurvival pattern after CBC with particular focus on time between first and secondbreast cancer diagnosis and age at CBC diagnosis.METHODS: Within the nationwide Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group database,we identified 68,466 breast cancer patients diagnosed during 1978-2012. Patients who subsequently developed CBC were identified in a previously establisheddatabase (N = 3004). Patients were followed for breast cancer-specific death inthe Danish Register of Causes of Death until 2015. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazardregression models. Cumulative breast cancer mortality from date of CBC wasestimated using the Aalen-Johansen method.RESULTS: Compared with UBC patients, the rate of dying from breast cancer wasmore than twofold higher following a CBC diagnosis, after adjustment for age,period, tumor characteristics, and treatment of the first breast cancer (HR 2.48;95% CI 2.31-2.66). Short time interval (< 5 years) was associated with higherbreast cancer-specific mortality after CBC among patients < 70 years at CBCdiagnosis compared with longer time intervals, but not among patients ≥ 70 years at CBC diagnosis.CONCLUSION: Breast cancer-specific mortality rates were markedly higher aftercompared with before a CBC diagnosis. We found higher breast cancer-specificmortality after CBC associated with a short interval between diagnoses amongpatients diagnosed with CBC before age 70 years.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4846-3 PMID: 29948403
