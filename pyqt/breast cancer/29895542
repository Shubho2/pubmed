CEA was originally thought to be a specific marker forcolorectal cancer, but it turned out to be a non-specific marker for furtherstudies. CEA levels can be elevated in breast, lung and liver cancers, amongothers, including medullary thyroid cancer. The authors report a case of a73-year-old woman who had a right hemicolectomy for an ascending colonadenocarcinoma and showed a persistent elevation in the CEA marker duringfollow-up. After several imaging tests, recurrence of the colon cancer was notfound, but the presence of thyroid nodules had been detected. The diagnosis of a medullary thyroid carcinoma was made after the finding of a high value ofcalcitonin. The patient had a total thyroidectomy with resection of the centraland lateral lymph nodes.© BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article)2018. All rights reserved.
