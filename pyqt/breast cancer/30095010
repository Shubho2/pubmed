L. Mehta Road, Vile Parle (West) , Mumbai , India.Cancer is the largest family of diseases that involve abnormal uncontrolled cell growth which metastasizes to other parts of the body. The most common type ofcancers includes lung, liver, colorectal, prostate, stomach, breast and cervical cancer with skin cancer excluding melanoma (contribute up to 40% of the cases).The conventional treatment approaches like surgery, chemotherapy, etc., haveseveral side effects such as severe inflammation and pain. Hence,pharmacotherapeutic approaches of antineoplastic agents can be advantageous fortreating various forms of cancer through the skin. Novel transdermal techniquesand preparations have been emerged to overcome the limitations of skin and topenetrate inside the cancerous cells by transporting through the deeper tissuesof the skin. The transdermal penetration of drugs using different formulationssuch as nanocarriers, physical penetration enhancement techniques, chemicalpenetration enhancers and newer technologies such as gels, dendrimers,needle-free injection jet etc., show improved patient compliance, abolition ofscars and economic value. The topical delivery of antineoplastic agents is anattractive choice for increasing site-specific delivery, reducing side effectsand improving therapeutic effects. The objective of this review is to presentinsights into pharmacotherapeutic techniques, which can be used for transdermaldelivery of anticancer agents through skin due to its potential to create a newfrontier in treatment of cancer.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1498349 PMID: 30095010
