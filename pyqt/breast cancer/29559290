Anelectrocardiogram-synchronized contrast-injected DSCT scan was obtained with the patient in the treatment position, in deep-inspiration breath-hold, usingretrospective sequential acquisition. The WH, LV, LMCA, and proximal, middle, anddistal LAD segments were contoured on each phase of the cardiac cycle. Themaximum, minimum, and mean Hausdorff distance between each structure and thetangential fields was assessed in ventricular systole and diastole.Four-dimensional dose-volume histograms were used to compare the systolic anddiastolic dosimetric data.RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled. The average maximum, minimum, and meanHausdorff distance variation from systole to diastole was ≤4 mm for the LV andLMCA and ≤3 mm for the WH and LAD segments. WH maximum dose and volume receiving 5 Gy were decreased in systole compared with diastole (42.9 Gy versus 44.5 Gy,P = .03, and 21.7 cm3 versus 27.7 cm3, P = .01), but the mean dose remainedsimilar throughout the cycle. The maximum and mean dose to the distal LAD was21.2 Gy versus 26.6 Gy (P = .005) and 8.6 Gy versus 13.2 Gy (P = .006) in systoleversus diastole, respectively. The maximum and mean dose to the middle LAD was18.4 Gy versus 25.1 Gy (P = .005) and 8.5 Gy versus 10.2 Gy in systole versusdiastole (P = .005). The maximum dose to the LV was lower in systole than indiastole (21.5 Gy vs 26.7 Gy; P = .005).CONCLUSIONS: In addition to deep-inspiration breath-hold, systolic irradiation isassociated with a reduction in dose to the LAD, LV, and WH. In addition to itspotential use in radiation planning for cardiac gating, DSCT imaging can be used to help define a planning organ at risk volume for clinically important cardiacsubstructures.Crown Copyright © 2018.
