Data on the biological features of African BCs are poor. Wedecided for the first time to compare AR expression of Tanzanian and Italian BCpatients.Patients and methods: Of the 69 consecutive patients seen at the Bugando Medical Center (Mwanza, Tanzania) from 2003 to 2010, who underwent resection of primaryBC evaluable for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor (PgR), and HER2 only 65were evaluable for AR by immunohistochemistry. Histopathological assessment andbiomolecular determinations were performed at the Cancer Institute of Romagna[Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo studio e la cura dei tumori (IRST)-IRCCS, Meldola, Italy]. Caucasian BC patients were selected from an electronic database and matched (1:2 ratio) for year of diagnosis and age at diagnosis.Results: The median age of patients at diagnosis was 51 (range 29-83) years forTanzanian and 53 (range 26-86) years for Italian patients. Tanzanian patientsharbored tumors with lower AR expression than Italian patients according to themedian percentage of immunopositive tumor cells (30% versus 80%, p < 0.0001) and staining intensity (p = 0.0003). The proportion of AR negative patients waslikewise higher among Tanzanian patients as regards both ≥1% and ≥10% cutoffs.AR-positive BCs were higher in luminal A and B tumors and decreased intriple-negative (TN) and HER2-enriched tumors in Tanzanian population.Conclusion: AR loss could represent an unfavorable prognostic marker in theAfrican population. The high frequency of TN tumors with high AR expression couldopen new perspectives of therapy for population in this low income country.DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00137 PMCID: PMC5885470PMID: 29651273
