The influence of Agar concentrationson the structural, morphological and optical properties of ZnO have beeninvestigated. The XRD pattern of Pure ZnO and Agar/ZnO nanocomposites indicatesthe hexagonal wurtzite phase of ZnO. The crystallite size of pure ZnO andAgar/ZnO nanocomposites was found to be in the range of 35.5 to 19.73 nm. PureZnO and Agar/ZnO nanocomposites showed nanospheroid and nanopaddy shapedmorphology from FESEM studies. The interplanar distance observed from the HRTEMimage confirms the plane of the prepared material. The elemental composition ofthe samples were characterized by EDX. The optical properties of Pure ZnO andAgar/ZnO nanocomposites were characterized by UV, FTIR and PL. The band gap ofAgar/ZnO nanocomposites were varied with the Agar concentration. Oxygen vacancyinduced photoluminescence of ZnO are observed and its intensity is found to beincreased linearly with the Agar concentration. The antibacterial activity of ZnOand Agar/ZnO nanocomposites was evaluated by disc diffusion method againstGram-positive (B.subtilis) and Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa) bacteria. Thecytotoxicity of Agar/ZnO nanocomposites was studied against Normal (L929) andBreast cancer cell line (MB231). The result of this investigation reveals thatthe Agar/ZnO nanocomposites deliver a dose dependent toxicity in normal andcancer cell line.Copyright © 2018.
