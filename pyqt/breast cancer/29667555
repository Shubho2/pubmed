Bulgaria.BACKGROUND: Based on the structure of RC-121 (D-Phe-c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys)-Thr-NH2, - synthetic derivatives of somatostatin),some analogs were synthesized and tested for in vitro cytotoxic and antioxidantactivity.OBJECTIVES: The new analogs were modifyed at position 5 with Dap(diaminopropanoic acid), Dab (diaminobutanoic acid) and Orn and at position 6with the unnatural amino acids Tle (t-leucine).METHODS: The in vitro cytotoxic effects of the substances were investigatedagainst a panel of human tumor cell lines HT-29 (human colorectal cancer cellline), MDA-MB-23 (human breast cancer cell line), Hep G-2 (human hepatocellularcarcinoma cell line) and HeLa (cervical cancer cell line). The antioxidantcapacities were tested by ORAC (Oxygen Radical Antioxidant Capacity) and HORAC(Hydroxyl Radical Averting Capacity) methods.RESULTS: All substances expressed significantly higher antioxidant capacity bycomparison with galic acid and Trolox. All substances showed considerableantioxidant capacity as well. Compound 2T(D-Phe-c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Dap-Tle-Cys)-Thr-NH2)had the highest antioxidant effect.The compound 4T (D-Phe-c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Tle-Cys)-Thr-NH2) displayedantiproliferative effect on HeLa cells with IC50 30 µM. The peptide analog 3T(D-Phe-c(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Tle-Cys)-Thr-NH2) exerted the most pronouncedinhibition on the cell vitality up to 53%, 56% and 65% resp. against MDA-MB-23,Hep G-2, HeLa in the higher testet concentration.CONCLUSION: the somatostatin analogues showed moderate influence on the vitality of different tumor cells and could be used in changing their pathology.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1871520618666180417164344 PMID: 29667555
