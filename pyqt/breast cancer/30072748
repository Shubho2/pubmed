Wecompared blood-borne miRNA signatures of early-stage basal-like(cytokeratin-CK5-positive) TNBC patients to age-matched controls. The miRNAs ofTNBC patients were assessed prior to and following platinum-based neoadjuvantchemotherapy (NCT). After an exploratory genome-wide study on 21 cases and 21controls using microarrays, the identified signatures were verified independentlyin two laboratories on the same and a new cohort by RT-qPCR. We differentiatedthe blood of TNBC patients before NCT from controls with 84% sensitivity. Themost significant miRNA for this diagnostic classification was miR-126-5p (twotailed t-test p-value of 1.4 × 10-5). Validation confirmed the microarray resultsfor all tested miRNAs. Comparing cancer patients prior to and post NCThighlighted 321 significant miRNAs (among them miR-34a, p-value of 1.2 × 10-23). Our results also suggest that changes in miRNA expression during NCT may havepredictive potential to predict pathological complete response (pCR). Inconclusion we report that miRNA expression measured from blood facilitates early and minimally-invasive diagnosis of basal-like TNBC. We also demonstrate that NCThas a significant influence on miRNA expression. Finally, we show thatblood-borne miRNA profiles monitored over time have potential to predict pCR.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29917-2 PMCID: PMC6072710PMID: 30072748
