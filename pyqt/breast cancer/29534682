The multi-functionalscaffold protein Connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of ras 2 (CNKSR2) plays a key role in regulating cell proliferation, and differentiation through multiplereceptor tyrosine kinase pathways. The aim of this study was to investigatewhether the interaction between Smurf2 and CNKSR2 has any significant role in thepost transcriptional regulation of CNKSR2 expression in breast cancer.METHODS: Here we demonstrate a novel interaction of CNKSR2 with Smurf2 byco-immunoprecipitation, indirect immunofluorescence studies, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, which can ubiquitinate, but stabilize CNKSR2 byprotecting it from proteasome mediated degradation.RESULTS: CNKSR2 protein levels were significantly increased upon forcedoverexpression of Smurf2, indicating the role of Smurf2 in regulating thestability of CNKSR2. Conversely, Smurf2 knockdown resulted in a marked decreasein the protein level expression of CNKSR2 by facilitating enhancedpolyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and reduced the proliferation and clonogenic survival of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Tissue microarraydata from 84 patients with various stages of mammary carcinoma, including (inorder of increasing malignant potential) normal, usual hyperplasia, fibrocysticchanges, fibroadenoma, carcinoma-in-situ, and invasive ductal carcinoma showed a statistically significant association between Smurf2 and CNKSR2 expression, whichis also well correlated with the ER, PR, and HER2 status of the tissue samples. Acomparatively high expression of Smurf2 and CNKSR2 was observed when theexpression of ER and PR was low, and HER2 was high. Consistently, both Smurf2 andCNKSR2 showed an integrated expression in MCF10 breast progression model celllines.CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our findings reveal that Smurf2 is a novel positiveregulator of CNKSR2 and suggest that Smurf2-CNKSR2 interaction may serve as acommon strategy to control proliferation of human breast cancer cells bymodulating CNKSR2 protein stability.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4188-x PMCID: PMC5850909PMID: 29534682
