The aim of the present study was totest the Integrated Behavior Change model in exercise and physical activitybehaviors. The study evaluated two different samples of older adults: the firstengaged in exercise class, the second doing spontaneous physical activity. Thekey analyses relied on Variance-Based Structural Modeling, which were performedby means of WARP PLS 6.0 statistical software. The analyses estimated theIntegrated Behavior Change model in predicting exercise and physical activity, ina longitudinal design across two months of assessment. The tested modelsexhibited a good fit with the observed data derived from the model focusing onexercise, as well as with those derived from the model focusing on physicalactivity. Results showed, also, some effects and relations specific to eachbehavioral context. Results may form a starting point for future experimental andintervention research.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25352 PMCID: PMC5986634PMID: 29875997
