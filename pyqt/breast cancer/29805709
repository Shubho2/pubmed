The occurrence and progression of breastcancer is linked to inactivation or downregulation of tumor suppressors, andactivation or upregulation of oncogenes. However, the mechanism of PAK7 involvingin the occurrence and progression of breast cancer is not yet fully understood.Methods: PAK7 expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry andcorrelated with clinicopatholgical parameters in breast cancer tissue microarray.The effects of PAK7 on breast cancer cells were detected by CCK-8 assay, colonformation assay, wound healing and transwell assays, and flow cytometry. Therelationship between PAK7 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was determined bywestern blotting, TOP/FOP flash, co-Immunoprecipitation and co-localizationassays. Results: PAK7 expression was significantly increased in breast cancertissues and positively correlated with pathological differentiation and TNM stageof breast cancer. Overexpression of PAK7 could significantly promoteproliferation and migration of breast cancer cells, and inhibit apoptosis. Incontrast, PAK7 knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells and promoted apoptosis. In addition, PAK7 could activateWnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. Further study found that PAK7 could directly bind to GSK3β and β-catenin, and regulate β-catenindegradation by phosphorylating GSK3β. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated thatPAK7, as an oncogene, involved in breast cancer progression by activating theWnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting that the potential applicability ofPAK7 as a target for breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.7150/jca.24934 PMCID: PMC5968771PMID: 29805709
