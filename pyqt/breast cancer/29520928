We sought to evaluate theclinical utility of prostate and breast overexpressed 1 (PBOV1) as a potentialPCa biomarker.METHODS: Patient tumor samples were designated by Grade Groups using the 2014Gleason grading system. Primary radical prostatectomy tumors were obtained from48 patients and evaluated for PBOV1 levels using Western blot analysis in matchedcancer and benign cancer-adjacent regions. Immunohistochemical evaluation ofPBOV1 was subsequently performed in 80 cancer and 80 benign cancer-adjacentpatient samples across two tissue microarrays (TMAs) to verify protein levels in epithelial tissue and to assess correlation between PBOV1 proteins and nucleararchitectural changes in PCa cells. Digital histomorphometric analysis was usedto track 22 parameters that characterized nuclear changes in PBOV1-stained cells.Using a training and test set for validation, multivariate logistic regression(MLR) models were used to identify significant nuclear parameters thatdistinguish Grade Group 3 and above PCa from Grade Group 1 and 2 PCa regions.RESULTS: PBOV1 protein levels were increased in tumors from Grade Group 3 andabove (GS 4 + 3 and ≥ 8) regions versus Grade Groups 1 and 2 (GS 3 + 3 and 3 + 4)regions (P = 0.005) as assessed by densitometry of immunoblots. Additionally, by immunoblotting, PBOV1 protein levels differed significantly between Grade Group 2(GS 3 + 4) and Grade Group 3 (GS 4 + 3) PCa samples (P = 0.028). In theimmunohistochemical analysis, measures of PBOV1 staining intensity stronglycorrelated with nuclear alterations in cancer cells. An MLR model retaining eightparameters describing PBOV1 staining intensity and nuclear architecturediscriminated Grade Group 3 and above PCa from Grade Group 1 and 2 PCa and benigncancer-adjacent regions with a ROC-AUC of 0.90 and 0.80, respectively, intraining and test sets.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the PBOV1 protein could be used todiscriminate Grade Group 3 and above PCa. Additionally, the PBOV1 protein couldbe involved in modulating changes to the nuclear architecture of PCa cells.Confirmatory studies are warranted in an independent population for furthervalidation.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/pros.23499 PMCID: PMC5882516 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29520928
