Therefore, we hypothesized that the overexpression ofBGN also promoted the development of multiple drug resistance (MDR) in coloncancer via NF-κB pathway. The expression of BGN was bilaterally modulated incolon cancer cell lines HT-29 and SW-480 and the effect of treatments on the cellproliferation and resistance to 5-FU was assessed. Moreover, the role of NF-κBsignaling in the BGN-mediated formation of MDR was further investigated bysubjecting BGN-overexpressed SW-480 cells to the co-treatment of chemo-agents andNF-κB inhibitor, PDTC. The inhibition of BGN expression decreased theproliferation potential of HT-29 cells while the induction of BGN expressionincreased the potential of SW-480 cells. BGN knockdown increased HT-29 cells'sensitivity to 5-FU, represented by the lower colony number and higher apoptotic rate. To the contrary, BGN overexpression promoted the resistance of SW-480 cellsto 5-FU. The effect of BGN modulation on colon cancer cells was associated withthe changes in apoptosis and NF-κB pathways: BGN inhibition increased theexpressions of pro-apoptosis indicators and suppressed NF-κB pathway activitywhile BGN overexpression had the opposite effect. It was also found that theBGN-mediated formation of MDR was impaired when NF-κB pathway was blocked.Findings outlined in the current study showed that BGN contributed to theformation of chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer cells by activating NF-κBsignaling.DOI: 10.1007/s11010-018-3365-1 PMID: 29761248
