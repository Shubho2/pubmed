The inositol-requiring kinase 1α(IRE1α)-X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) pathway is the most evolutionarilyconserved of the three major signaling branches of the UPR. Here, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen to obtain a systematic assessment of genes integrated inthe IRE1α-XBP1 axis. We monitored the expression of an XBP1-luciferase chimericprotein in which luciferase was fused in-frame with the spliced (active) form of XBP1. Using cells expressing this reporter construct, we identified 162 genes forwhich siRNA inhibition resulted in alteration in XBP1 splicing. These genesexpress diverse types of proteins modulating a wide range of cellular processes. Pathway analysis identified a set of genes implicated in the pathogenesis ofbreast cancer. Several genes, including BCL10, GCLM, and IGF1R, correlated withworse relapse-free survival (RFS) in an analysis of patients with triple-negativebreast cancer (TNBC). However, in this cohort of 1,908 patients, only high GCLMexpression correlated with worse RFS in both TNBC and non-TNBC patients.Altogether, our study revealed unidentified roles of novel pathways regulatingthe UPR, and these findings may serve as a paradigm for exploring noveltherapeutic opportunities based on modulating the UPR.Implications: Genome-wideRNAi screen identifies novel genes/pathways that modulate IRE1α-XBP1 signaling inhuman tumor cells and leads to the development of improved therapeutic approachestargeting the UPR.Visual Overview:http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanres/16/5/745/F1.large.jpg Mol CancerRes; 16(5); 745-53. ©2018 AACR.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-17-0307 PMCID: PMC5932228 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29440447
