Electronic address:yexiong@yahoo.com.BACKGROUND: To investigate the superiority of breast-conserving surgery (BCS)plus radiotherapy (RT) compared with mastectomy alone for patients with stage Ibreast cancer in a real-world setting.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data from patients with histologically confirmed stage I breast cancer treated from 1999 to 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Theassociation of outcomes with the choice of treatment (BCS plus RT vs. mastectomy)was evaluated using multivariable proportional hazards regression and furtherconfirmed using propensity score matching methods.RESULTS: Of 6137 eligible patients in the present study, 1296 underwent BCS plus RT and 4841 underwent mastectomy plus axillary lymph node dissection without RT(mastectomy group). Multivariate analysis revealed that BCS plus RT was relatedto similar locoregional recurrence-free survival but greater distantmetastasis-free survival (P = .003) and overall survival (P = .036) compared withmastectomy. For the 1252 pairs of patients matched using propensity scorematching, the BCS plus RT groups enjoyed significantly greater 5-year overallsurvival (99.1% vs. 96.1%; P = .001), distant metastasis-free survival (97.0% vs.92.2%; P < .001), and disease-free survival (95.3% vs. 90.2%; P = .001) compared with the mastectomy group.CONCLUSION: BCS plus RT provided better outcomes than mastectomy for eligiblepatients with stage I breast cancer and should be offered as a preferredtreatment option.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
