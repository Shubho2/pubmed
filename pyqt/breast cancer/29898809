[Epub ahead of print]BLT2, a leukotriene B4 receptor 2, as a novel prognostic biomarker oftriple-negative breast cancer.Park J, Jang JH, Park GS, Chung Y, You HJ, Kim JH(1).Author information: (1)Department of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, KoreaUniversity, Seoul 02841, South Korea.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is considered to be a notorious type ofcancer due to its aggressive metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Recentevidence suggests that BLT2, a low-affinity LTB4 receptor is criticallyassociated with the phenotypes of TNBC cells, including invasion, metastasis, andsurvival. Furthermore, in a group of 545 breast cancer patients with metastasis, we observed that the high-BLT2 subgroup had a lower disease-free-survival ratethan the low-BLT2 subgroup. Thus, we theorized that anti-BLT2 strategies couldfacilitate the development of new therapies used for TNBC. This review focuses onrecent discoveries regarding BLT2 and its roles in as a novel prognosticbiomarker in TNBC.PMID: 29898809
