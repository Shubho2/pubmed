This study aimsto evaluate: (a) methods of TILs assessment, and (b) their prognosticsignificance in breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Hematoxylin and eosinsections from two clinically annotated DCIS cohorts; a training set (n = 150 pureDCIS) and a validation set (n = 666 comprising 534 pure DCIS and 132 caseswherein DCIS and invasive breast carcinoma were co-existent) were assessed. Sevendifferent scoring methods were applied to the training set to identify the mostoptimal reproducible method associated with strongest prognostic value. Amongdifferent methods, TILs touching ducts' basement membrane or away from it by one lymphocyte cell thickness provided the strongest significant association withoutcome and highest concordance rate [inter-cluster correlationcoefficient = 0.95]. Assessment of periductal TILs at increasing distances fromDCIS (0.2 , 0.5 , and 1 mm) as well as percent of stromal TILs were practicallychallenging and showed lower concordance rates than touching TILs. TILs hotspots and lymphoid follicles did not show prognostic significance. Within the pure DCISvalidation set, dense TILs were associated with younger age, symptomaticpresentation, larger size, higher nuclear grade, comedo necrosis and estrogenreceptor negativity as well as shorter recurrence-free interval (p = 0.002). Inmultivariate survival analysis, dense TILs were independent predictor of shorter recurrence-free interval (p = 0.002) in patients treated with breastconservation. DCIS associated with invasive carcinoma showed denser TILs thanpure DCIS (p = 9.0 × 10-13). Dense TILs is an independent prognostic variable in DCIS. Touching TILs provides a reproducible method for their assessment that can potentially be used to guide management.DOI: 10.1038/s41379-018-0040-8 PMID: 29559742
