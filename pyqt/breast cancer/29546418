A total of 2570 patients, diagnosed in 2011 with prostate, breast, colorectal,lung, gynaecological and skin cancers including malignant melanoma, and 9424controls were selected from the Swedish Cancer Register and a regional healthcare database. Diagnostic codes [International Statistical Classification ofDiseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10)] from primary carefor patients with ≥4 GP consultations registered in the year before cancerdiagnosis were collected. Likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated for variablesassociated with the different cancers.Results: Fifty-six percent of the patients had consulted a GP four or more times in the year before cancer diagnosis. Alarm symptoms or signs represented 60% ofthe codes with the highest LR, but only 40% of the 10 most prevalent codes.Breast lump had the highest LR, 11.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.0-17.8];abnormalities of plasma proteins had an LR of 5.0 (95% CI 3.0-8.2) and abnormalserum enzyme levels had an LR of 4.6 (95% CI 3.6-5.9). Early clinical featuresassociated with cancer had been registered already at the first two GPconsultations.Conclusion: One out of six clinical features associated with cancer werepresented by cancer patients with four or more pre-referral consultations alreadyat the two first consultations. These early clinical features that were focal andhad benign characteristics might have been missed diagnostic opportunities.DOI: 10.1093/fampra/cmy012 PMID: 29546418
