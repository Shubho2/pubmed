The 10-year breast cancer-specific survival and overallsurvival were 98.1 and 82.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that age, ethnicity, surgery procedures, radiotherapy and chemotherapy wereindependent predictors affecting survival outcomes. There was comparable breastcancer-specific survival between surgery and nonsurgery groups.CONCLUSION: The patients with TC has excellent survival outcomes, which may inpart be due to the favorable tumor characteristics.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2018-0385 PMID: 29989443
