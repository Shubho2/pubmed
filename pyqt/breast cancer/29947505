[Epub ahead ofprint]Functionalization of Halloysite Nanotubes via Grafting of Dendrimer for EfficientIntracellular Delivery of siRNA.Long Z, Wu YP, Gao HY, Li YF, He RR, Liu M.Here, polyamidoamine grafted halloysite nanotubes (PAMAM- g-HNTs) weresynthesized for loading of siRNA in order to intracellular delivery of siRNA and treat of breast cancer via gene therapy. The successful grafting of PAMAM on HNTswas confirmed by various analytical methods. The size, zeta potential, andgrafting ratio of PAMAM- g-HNTs is ∼206.2 nm, +19.8 mV, and 3.04%, respectively. PAMAM- g-HNTs showed good cytocompatibility toward HUVECs (84.7%) and MCF-7 cells(82.3%) even at high concentration of 100 μg/mL. PAMAM- g-HNTs/siRNA exhibitedenhanced cellular uptake efficiency of 94.3% compared with Lipofectamine 2000(Lipo2000)/siRNA (83.6%). PAMAM- g-HNTs/small interfering RNA-vascularendothelial growth factor (siVEGF) led to 78.0% knockdown of cellular VEGF mRNAand induced 33.6% apoptosis in the MCF-7 cells, which is also much higher thanthat of Lipo2000/siVEGF. In vivo anti-cancer results demonstrated that PAMAM-g-HNTs/siVEGF treated 4T1-bearing mice showed enhanced anti-cancer efficacy than Lipo2000/siVEGF group. Also, the nanocarrier system showed negligible toxiceffects toward the major organs of mice. In vivo fluorescence imaging studiesshowed that there is a slight decrease in the fluorescence signal of PAMAM-g-HNTs/cy5-siVEGF after 72 h post-injection. Therefore, PAMAM- g-HNTs showpromising application as novel nanovectors for siRNA delivery and gene therapy ofcancer.DOI: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00321 PMID: 29947505
