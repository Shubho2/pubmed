A50-year-old woman with a history of triple positive metastatic invasive ductalcarcinoma of the left breast, stage IV (T3N2M1), underwent neoadjuvantchemotherapy, mastectomy, adjuvant radiotherapy and maintenance hormonaltreatment with HER2 targeted therapies. At 20 months after definitive treatmentof her primary, imaging showed an isolated progressive enlargement of lymph nodesbetween hepatic segment V/IVB and the neck of the pancreas. Radiofrequencyablation was considered, however, this approach was decided not to be optimal dueto the proximity to stomach, and pancreatic duct. The patient was treated withSMART for 40 Gray in 5 fractions. Two and a half years later, the patient remainswithout evidence of disease progression. She experienced Grade 2 acute and latetoxicity that was successfully managed with medications. This experience showsthat SMART is a feasible and effective treatment to control theÂ abdominaloligometastatic disease for breast cancer.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2368 PMCID: PMC5969791PMID: 29805937
