The present study aimed to evaluate the effects ofAs2S2 on the human breast cancer MCF‑7 cell line cultured in bothtwo‑dimensional (2D) monolayers and three‑dimensional (3D) spheroids to exploreits therapeutic potential in breast cancer treatment. Cellular viability and the induction of apoptosis were examined with a cell counting kit‑8 (CCK‑8) assay andflow cytometric analysis, respectively. Alterations in the expression levels ofapoptosis‑associated proteins, including Bcl‑2‑associated X protein (Bax), B‑celllymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2), p53, and caspase‑7, as well as the cell survival‑associatedproteins, phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mammalian target ofrapamycin (mTOR), were assessed by western blotting. Although a dose‑dependentreduction in cell viability, which occurred in association with the induction of apoptosis triggered by the addition of 2‑24 µM As2S2, was observed in both 2D‑and 3D‑culture systems, 3D spheroids were less sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of As2S2 compared with the 2D cultured cells. A significant increase in theexpression levels of Bax, p53, and caspase‑7 was observed in treated 2D‑cultured cells, whereas a similar increase in the expression levels of Bax was onlyconfirmed in treated 3D spheroids, although there was a trend towards theincreased expression of p53 and caspase‑7 in the 3D spheroids. These resultssuggested that these molecules are closely associated with As2S2‑mediatedcytotoxicity in the two culture systems, and further suggested that thedifference in the sensitivity to As2S2 between 2D monolayers and 3D spheroids maybe attributed to the differential alterations in the expression levels ofproteins associated with cell mortality. Significant downregulation of theexpression levels of Bcl‑2, PI3K, Akt and mTOR was observed in the two culturesystems. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that As2S2inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in both 2D‑ and 3D‑ cultured MCF‑7 cells, which may be associated with activation of the pro‑apoptotic pathway andthe inhibition of pro‑survival signaling. These results have provided novelinsights into clinical applications of As2S2 in the treatment of patients withbreast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4357 PMID: 29620191
