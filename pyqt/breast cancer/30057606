This study aims to analyze global tendencies in clinicaltrials in oncology and discuss research priorities and resource allocation in theinvestigation of new drugs for cancers that significantly affect the leastdeveloped countries. This was a retrospective and analytical study that included data collected from the World Health Organization's International Clinical TrialsRegistry Platform (ICTRP) in 2014. According to our results, there was a tendencyfor clinical trials involving breast and lung cancer to be conducted in countrieswith a lower level of economic development. On the other hand, cervical, stomach,and liver cancer, despite the significant burden that these place on middle- and low-income countries, were studied little among the countries selected. Inconclusion, the organizations that most fund research to develop new drugs forcancer treatment continue to show little interest in prioritizing resources tofund research for certain types of cancer such as those of the cervix, stomach,and liver, which have a significant impact in low- and middle-income countries.DOI: 10.1155/2018/8092702 PMCID: PMC6051037PMID: 30057606
