Thisrearrangement produces a jadomycin with a 3a hemiaminal position that issusceptible to solvolysis. A structure-activity relationship is discussed basedon the antimicrobial activity of 1 compared to previously reported jadomycins,providing evidence that the presence of a 3a hemiaminal enhances activity againstGram-positive bacteria. Additionally, assays to quantify reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cell viability were performed using a series of ninejadomycins. Compound 1 was found to produce the highest ROS activity and topossess the greatest cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1038/s41429-018-0060-0 PMID: 29700425
