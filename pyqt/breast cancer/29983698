Of these women, 5-10% have an inherited form of breast cancer with a mutation in a major gene, such as the breast cancer susceptibility genes 1or 2 (BRCA1 or BRCA2). Triple negative (the most common subtype ofBRCA1-associated breast cancers) and Her2-positive breast cancer patients havemore frequently been observed to develop central nervous system (CNS) metastases compared to other molecular subtypes of breast cancers. However, it remains anopen question if BRCA2-associated breast cancers also have a higher propensity todevelop CNS metastases. Here we report a rare case of recurrent BRCA2-associated breast cancer which manifested as orbital metastases. At the time of thispublication, this is one of the first cases of BRCA2-associated breast cancer to present with orbital metastases. In this article, we discuss the diagnosticchallenges and review the literature regarding this rare presentation.DOI: 10.1159/000489698 PMCID: PMC6031950PMID: 29983698
