We aimed to determine S100A8/A9 expression alone and withcoexpression of Gr1 (a myeloid marker) in primary tumor and visceral tissuesinvaded by metastatic breast carcinoma.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female BALB/c mice were injected with 4TLM, 4THM, and 67NRorthotopically. Confluent cells (75%-80%) were used. Primary tumor, lung, liver, and spleen tissue samples were removed 26 days after injection. Peripheral blood smears and metastasis assay were performed, as was immunohistochemistry andstaining.RESULTS: S100A8/A9 immunoreactivity alone or coexpressed with Gr1 was found inprimary tumors formed by 4TLM and 4THM cells, which was markedly higher than inprimary tumors formed by nonmetastatic 67NR cells. Similarly, liver and lungtissues obtained from mice injected with 4TLM or 4THM cells were invaded byS100A8/A9-positive and Gr1-positive cells. Double-positive cells were markedlyfewer in liver and lung tissues of animals injected with 67NR cells.S100A8/A9-positive cells were mostly localized in red pulp of spleens. Weobserved an increased number of neutrophils in the peripheral blood of miceinjected with metastatic breast carcinoma cells.CONCLUSION: Tumor-derived factors may increase S100A8/A9-positive cells locallyand systemically, and S100A8/A9-positive cells may provide an appropriate milieu for the formation of metastasis.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
