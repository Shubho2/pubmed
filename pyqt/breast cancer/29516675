[Epub ahead of print]Do FHIT gene alterations play a role in human solid tumors?Silveira Zavalhia L(1), Weber Medeiros A(1), Oliveira Silva A(1), Vial RoeheA(1)(2).Author information: (1)Research Laboratory in Pathology, Graduate Program in Pathology of theUniversidade Federal de Ciências da Saúde de Porto Alegre (UFCSPA), Porto Alegre,Brazil.(2)Department of Pathology, Universidade Federal de Ciências da Saúde de PortoAlegre (UFCSPA), Porto Alegre, Brazil.The fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene encloses an active common chromosomalfragile site, FRA3B. This gene is known to be associated with genomicinstability, apoptosis and DNA damage. FHIT disturbances have been related tocarcinogenesis in different types of human tumor. Despite this, there are somecontroversies about the exact role of the FHIT gene in relation to tumor biology.Several pieces of evidence support the hypothesis that FHIT acts as a tumorsuppressor gene. A loss or decrease in the Fhit protein expression appears to be related to tumor progression, poor prognostic factors and lower survival rates.The most frequent causes of FHIT expression changes are gene mutations,epigenetic alteration and loss of heterozygosity. This literature review aims to clarify the involvement of the FHIT gene in carcinogenesis, tumor progression andclinical outcome in prevalent solid malignancies, such as breast, lung, cervical,esophageal, gastric and colorectal cancers.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ajco.12868 PMID: 29516675
