The bioengineered oleosome is composed of neutral lipids surrounded bya phospholipid monolayer with embedded oleosin fusion proteins. The oleosin wasgenetically fused to a nanobody of a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Arecombinant protein consisting of immunoglobulin-binding protein LG fused to GFP was used to couple the oleosome to an antibody for targeted delivery to breastcancer cells. The lipid core of the oleosome was loaded with magneticnanoparticles and carmustine as the lipophilic drug. The magnetic oleosome wascharacterized using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic lightscattering. Moreover, the specific delivery of oleosome into the target cancercell was investigated via confocal microscopy. To examine the cell viability ofthe delivered oleosome, a conventional3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was carriedout. Furthermore, an animal study was conducted to confirm the effect resultingfrom the delivery of the anticancer drug-loaded oleosomes. Taken together, thefabricated lipophilic drug-loaded magnetic oleosome can be a powerful tool foroil-based drug delivery agent for cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b19255 PMID: 29488744
