Interleukin-10 (IL-10),an anti-inflammatory cytokine, is an immunosuppressive factor involved intumorigenesis. The present study was conducted to investigate the gene silencing effect of a small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting IL-10 on the apoptoticpathway in breast cancer cell line. Methods: The siRNA targeting IL-10 and aglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) clone were introduced intoMDA-MB-231 cells. Real-time PCR assays were used to determine IL-10 and GAPDHgene expression levels, in addition to those for protein kinase B (AKT),phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), caspase-3 andcaspase-9 genes related to apoptosis. Results: Inhibition of IL-10 by the siRNAaccelerated apoptosis and was accompanied by significant increase in caspase-3and caspase-9 and a significant decrease in PI3K, AKT and Bcl2 expression levels compared to the non-transfected case. Conclusions: In conclusion, the production of IL-10 may represent a new escape mechanism by breast cancer cells to evadedestruction by the immune system. IL-10 gene silencing causes down regulation of both PI3K/AKT and Bcl2 gene expression and also increases the Bbc3, BAX caspase3,and caspase 3 cleavage expression levels. ILâ€“10 might represent a promising newtarget for therapeutic strategies.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.3.777 PMCID: PMC5980855PMID: 29582634
