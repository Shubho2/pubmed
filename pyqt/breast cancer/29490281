Electronic address:r.p.grose@qmul.ac.uk.Development of resistance causes failure of drugs targeting receptor tyrosinekinase (RTK) networks and represents a critical challenge for precision medicine.Here, we show that PHLDA1 downregulation is critical to acquisition andmaintenance of drug resistance in RTK-driven cancer. Using fibroblast growthfactor receptor (FGFR) inhibition in endometrial cancer cells, we identify anAkt-driven compensatory mechanism underpinned by downregulation of PHLDA1. Wedemonstrate broad clinical relevance of our findings, showing that PHLDA1downregulation also occurs in response to RTK-targeted therapy in breast andrenal cancer patients, as well as following trastuzumab treatment in HER2+ breastcancer cells. Crucially, knockdown of PHLDA1 alone was sufficient to confer denovo resistance to RTK inhibitors and induction of PHLDA1 expressionre-sensitized drug-resistant cancer cells to targeted therapies, identifyingPHLDA1 as a biomarker for drug response and highlighting the potential of PHLDA1 reactivation as a means of circumventing drug resistance.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).
