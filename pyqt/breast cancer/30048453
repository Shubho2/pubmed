In Australia, prescribing restrictions are put in place to reflect existing evidence of cost-effectiveness of these medicines. Astherapeutic options continue to expand, these restrictions may not be perceivedto align with best practice and it is not known if their use in the real-worldclinic adheres to these restrictions. We examined the treatment of womenreceiving trastuzumab for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (HER2+MBC) todetermine the extent to which treatment adhered to national prescribingrestrictions.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our population-based, retrospective cohort study useddispensing records for every Australian woman initiating publicly-subsidisedtrastuzumab for HER2+MBC between 2001-2013, followed through 2016. We usedgroup-based trajectory models (GBTMs) to cluster patients, first on theirpatterns of trastuzumab exposure, and then on their patterns of lapatinib andchemotherapy exposure. We described the characteristics of patients within eachcluster, and examined their treatments and combinations of treatments todetermine restriction adherence.RESULTS: Of 5,052 patients initiating trastuzumab, 1,795 (36%) received at least one non-adherent HER2-targeted treatment. The most common non-adherent treatmentswere trastuzumab combinations involving vinorelbine (24% of non-adherenttreatments); capecitabine (24%); and anthracyclines (10%). Non-adherent lapatinibuse was observed in 4% of patients. GBTM identified three trastuzumab exposureclusters, each containing three further sub-clusters. The largest proportions of non-adherent treatments were in sub-clusters with longer trastuzumab exposure andmore non-taxane chemotherapy. Patients in these sub-clusters were younger thanthose in sub-clusters with less non-adherent treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights that, even during the relatively simplertreatment era of our study period, a substantial amount of treatment did notadhere to prescribing restrictions. As more trials are conducted exploringpertuzumab and T-DM1 in combination with different chemotherapies and otherHER2-targeted therapies, the regulation and funding of HER2-targeted treatmentwill become more challenging.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198152 PMCID: PMC6061975PMID: 30048453
