One of the supposed and novelmechanisms is an alteration of circadian gene expression. Circadian genes play a crucial role in many physiological processes. These processes, such as genomicstability, DNA repair mechanism and apoptosis, are frequently disrupted in breasttumors. To assess the significance of circadian gene expression in breast cancer,we carried out an analysis of CLOCK, BMAL1, NPAS2, PER1, PER2, PER3 and CRY1,CRY2, TIMELESS, CSNK1E expression by the use of the quantitative Real-Time PCRtechnique in tumor tissue and non-tumor adjacent normal tissue sampled from 107women with a newly diagnosed disease. The obtained data were compared to theclinical and histopathological features. PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY2 were found to be significantly down-expressed, while CLOCK, TIMELESS were over-expressed in thestudied tumor samples compared to the non-tumor samples. Only gene expression of CRY1 was significantly down-regulated with progression according to the TNMclassification. We found significantly decreased expression of CRY2, PER1, PER2genes in the ER/PR negative breast tumors compared to the ER/PR positive tumors. Additionally, expression of CRY2, NPAS2 genes had a decreased level in the poorlydifferentiated tumors in comparison with the well and moderately differentiatedones. Our results indicate that circadian gene expression is altered in breastcancer tissue, which confirms previous observations from various animal and invitro studies.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199622 PMCID: PMC6025856PMID: 29958276
