In this work, Jiang et al. used middle-down MS to study the dynamics of coexisting PTMs on histone H4 in two breast cancercell lines. They found that overall serine 1 phosphorylation (S1ph) is mildlyregulated during the cell cycle, but S1ph coexistence frequency with acetylationsand methylations on the lysine residues of the N-terminal tail is remarkablytuned during S phase and G2/M phase. Together, the team placed another benchmark proving that MS analysis of combinatorial histone PTMs provides a morecomprehensive view on chromatin state than studying individual marks. We shouldthen constantly question ourselves regarding the limitations of analyzing single PTMs when we attempt to define their effect on protein functions.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
