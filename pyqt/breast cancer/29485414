Epub 2018 Feb 27.The Association between Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Cancer Risk: Results fromthe Prospective KORA F4 Study.Cheney CP, Thorand B, Huth C, Berger K, Peters A, Seifert-Klauss V, Kiechle M,Strauch K, Quante AS.BACKGROUND: Many studies have examined the relationship between vitamin D andspecific types of cancer with inconsistent results. Furthermore, to date, noobservational studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between vitamin Dand total cancer risk.METHODS: We analyzed data from a population-based prospective cohort studyincluding 2,003 initially cancer-free participants from the KORA F4 study withbaseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) measurements (surveyed between 2006 and 2008). We used Cox proportional hazard models to assess the associationbetween 25(OH)D levels and incident cancer risk.RESULTS: Within a follow-up period of 7 years, 69 of the participants developedcancer. Overall, we observed no significant relationship between serum 25(OH)Dlevels and cancer risk. The hazard ratio (HR) per 1 ng/ml increase in 25 (OH)Dfor this relationship was 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.04) adjustingfor age, sex, body mass index, and season of blood draw. This was also true insubgroup analysis for prostate cancer (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88-1.03), breast cancer (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97-1.09), and colorectal cancer (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88-1.07).CONCLUSION: Our study found no protective effect of 25(OH)D against developingcancer. However, studies with more participants and additional measurements of25(OH)D are still needed to accurately clarify the relationship between 25(OH)Dand total cancer risk.Â© 2018 S.
