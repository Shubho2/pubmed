However, no study has been conducted toevaluate the expression level of miR-19b in patients with breast cancer (BC).This study was aimed to investigate the expression level of miR-19b in humanmalignant and healthy breast tissues with histopathology of ER+/PR+/HER2-. Weperformed a miRNA real-time PCR to detect differential expression of miR-19b in40 BC, including 17 BC with familial background and 23 BC without familialbackground, and 12 non-tumoral tissues. Moreover, a bioinformatics predictionupon miR-19b functionality in BC cells was performed. The miR-19b expressionlevel was significantly down-regulated in BC, BC with familial background, and BCwithout familial background compared with its expression in normal tissue (pvalue, <0.0001; fold change, -7.45; p value, 0.0003; fold change, -6.45; and pvalue, 0.0005; fold change, -8.41, respectively). Moreover, according to the AUCs(area under curve) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, miR-19b cansignificantly distinguish all defined categories. Last, in agreement with ourexperimental findings, proteoglycans in cancer, pathways in cancer, FoxOsignaling pathway, central carbon metabolism in cancer, p53 signaling pathway,transcriptional misregulation in cancer, and prolactin signaling pathway werepredicted as miR-19b-related signaling pathways. In summary, down-regulation ofmiR-19b in BC vs healthy tissue suggests that mir-19b can function as a tumorsuppressor. Our results shed additional information on controversial expressionpattern of miR-19b depending on different cancer types.Â© 2018 APMIS.
