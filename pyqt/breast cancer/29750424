Epub 2018 May 8.Stat3/Oct-4/c-Myc signal circuit for regulating stemness-mediated doxorubicinresistance of triple-negative breast cancer cells and inhibitory effects ofWP1066.Cheng CC(1), Shi LH(1), Wang XJ(1), Wang SX(2), Wan XQ(1), Liu SR(1), Wang YF(1),Lu Z(1), Wang LH(1), Ding Y(1).Author information: (1)Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Weifang Medical College, Weifang, Shandong261053, P.R.

China.Doxorubicin (Dox) is widely used in the treatment of triple-negative breastcancer cells (TNBCs), however resistance limits its effectiveness. Cancer stemcells (CSCs) are associated with Dox resistance in MCF-7 estrogen receptorpositive breast cancer cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) may functionally shift non-CSCs towards CSCs. However, whether Stat3drives the formation of CSCs during the development of resistance in TNBC, andwhether a Stat3 inhibitor reverses CSC-mediated Dox resistance, remains to beelucidated. In the present study, human MDA-MB-468 and murine 4T1 mammarycarcinoma cell lines with the typical characteristics of TNBCs, were comparedwith estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells as a model system. The MTT assay was used to detect cytotoxicity of Dox. In addition, the expression levels ofCSC-specific markers and transcriptional factors were measured by westernblotting, immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry. The mammosphereformation assay was used to detect stem cell activity. Under long-term continuoustreatment with Dox at a low concentration, TNBC cultures not only exhibited adrug-resistant phenotype, but also showed CSC properties. These Dox-resistantTNBC cells showed activation of Stat3 and high expression levels of pluripotency transcription factors octamer-binding transcription factor-4 (Oct-4) and c-Myc,which was different from the high expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (Sox2) in Dox-resistant MCF-7 cells. WP1066 inhibited the phosphorylation of Stat3, anddecreased the expression of Oct-4 and c-Myc, leading to a reduction in theCD44-positive cell population, and restoring the sensitivity of the cells to Dox.Taken together, a novel signal circuit of Stat3/Oct-4/c-Myc was identified forregulating stemness-mediated Dox resistance in TNBC. The Stat3 inhibitor WP1066was able to overcome the resistance to Dox through decreasing the enrichment ofCSCs, highlighting the therapeutic potential of WP1066 as a novel sensitizer ofDox-resistant TNBC.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4399 PMID: 29750424
