However, thepro-metastatic mechanism of YAP remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that YAPfunctions as a transcriptional repressor of growth differentiation factor-15(GDF15), a divergent member of the transforming growth factor superfamily, inseveral breast cancer cell lines. Functionally, knockdown of YAP decreased,whereas knockdown of GDF15 increased, the metastatic potential of breast cancercells. More than that, the reduced metastasis in YAP-depleted cells could bereversed by simultaneous knockdown of GDF15. Mechanistically, the repressiveeffect of YAP on GDF15 requires its transcriptional factor TEAD (TEA domainfamily). In addition, YAP recruits polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) totri-methylate histone H3 lysine 27 in the promoter region of GDF15.Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that YAP and enhancer of zeste 2 PRC2 subunit (EZH2) physically interact with each other. In conclusion, our data reveal that YAP promotes metastasis of breast cancer cells by repressing GDF15transcription and present a novel molecular mechanism underlying thepro-metastasis function of YAP oncoprotein, with the implication of a therapeuticavenue for breast cancer treatment.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
