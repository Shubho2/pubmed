Epub 2018Feb 1.Axillary Web Syndrome in Breast Cancer: A Prevalent But Under-RecognizedPostoperative Complication.Harris SR(1).Author information: (1)Department of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, University of BritishColumbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.The purpose of this review is to define axillary web syndrome (AWS) and describe its diagnosis and management. The following databases were searched through July 2017: PubMed, EMBASE (OvidSP), Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied HealthLiterature, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Search terms included 'axillary web syndrome', 'axillary cording', and'lymphatic cording'. 49 articles were identified; 8 did not relate to breastcancer, and 3 were not in English. Of the remaining articles, the majority werecase reports, case series, or descriptive reviews. 2 systematic reviews werelocated as well as 1 randomized trial, 6 prospective cohort studies, and 2retrospective cohort studies. Although a common sequela after axillary surgeryfor breast cancer staging, AWS has been poorly described in the medicalliterature as to the underlying pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management.Interventions range from patient education and simple reassurance that thesyndrome will resolve spontaneously to active physical or manual therapies tomaintain upper extremity range-of-motion, especially adequate motion forundergoing radiation therapy. Oncologists, breast surgeons, family physicians,and oncology nurse practitioners that work with patients with breast cancershould educate them about this prevalent complication and inform thempreoperatively about what to anticipate.DOI: 10.1159/000485023 PMCID: PMC5981636 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29887791
