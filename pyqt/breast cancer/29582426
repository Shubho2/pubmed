In this study, we determined the prevalence of BRCA1/2 LGRs in 834patients with familial breast cancer (FBC) and 660 patients with sporadictriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who were negative for BRCA1/2 small-rangemutations using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification method. Wefound that 20 index patients (2.4%) in the FBC group carried a BRCA1 or BRCA2LGR, and the frequencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 LGRs were 1.6% and 0.8%,respectively. Seven index patients (1.1%) carried a BRCA1 LGR in 660 sporadicTNBC patients, whereas no BRCA2 LGRs were found in these patients. Among theBRCA1/2 LGRs, 48.1% (13/27) were novel, and the breakpoints of the majority ofthe LGRs were identified. ΨBRCA1-mediated homologous recombination (HR) andAlu-mediated HR/non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) accounted for 40% and 30% ofthe BRCA1 LGRs, respectively. Alu-mediated HR accounted for 71.4% of the BRCA2LGRs, and the remaining one-third was generated through Long interspersed nuclearelements (LINE)-mediated NHEJ. Our findings suggest that both FBC patients andsporadic TNBC patients should be tested for BRCA1/2 LGRs.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
