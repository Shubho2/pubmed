Epub 2018Jun 13.The evolution of biosimilars in oncology, with a focus on trastuzumab.Nixon NA(1), Hannouf MB(2)(3), Verma S(1).Author information: (1)Department of Oncology, Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Faculty of Medicine,University of Calgary, Calgary, AB.(2)Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, ON.(3)Ivey Business School, Western University, London, ON.Cancer therapy has evolved significantly with increased adoption of biologicagents ("biologics"). That evolution is especially true for her2 (human epidermalgrowth factor receptor-2)-positive breast cancer with the introduction oftrastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the her2 receptor, which, incombination with chemotherapy, significantly improves survival in both metastaticand early disease. Although the efficacy of biologics is undeniable, theirexpense is a significant contributor to the increasing cost of cancer care.Across disease sites and indications, biosimilar agents are rapidly beingdeveloped with the goal of offering cost-effective alternatives to biologics.Biosimilars are pharmaceuticals whose molecular shape, efficacy, and safety aresimilar, but not identical, to those of the original product. Although theseagents hold the potential to improve patient access, complexities in theirproduction, evaluation, cost, and clinical application have raised questionsamong experts. Here, we review the landscape of biosimilar agents in oncology,with a focus on trastuzumab biosimilars. We discuss important considerations thatmust be made as these agents are introduced into routine cancer care.DOI: 10.3747/co.25.3942 PMCID: PMC6001768PMID: 29910660
