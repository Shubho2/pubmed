All breast MRIs were performed using a 1.5-T MRI scanner with a 16-channel breast radiofrequency coil.The abbreviated protocols based on DWI (AP1) and postcontrast MRI (AP2) wereassessed independently by two radiologists. Sensitivity and specificity werecalculated. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed and theareas under the curves (AUCs) were compared between AP1 and AP2.RESULTS: The study included 87 patients with 89 breast cancer lesions ≤ 2 cm indiameter. The sensitivity/specificity for AP1 and AP2 for reader 1 was 89.9/97.6%and 95.5/90.6%, respectively, and those for reader 2 was 95.5/94.1% and98.9/94.1%, respectively. The AUCs for AP1 and AP2 for reader 1 were 0.9629 and0.9640 (p = 0.95), respectively, and those for reader 2 were 0.9755 and 0.9843(p = 0.46), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The detectability of the unenhanced abbreviated protocol based onDWI would be comparable to that of abbreviated postcontrast MRI for breastcancer.DOI: 10.1007/s11604-018-0731-6 PMID: 29582348
