All mammograms were double read in a blinded fashion. Discordant readings were routinely recalled without consensus orarbitration. During the 2-year follow-up, relevant data of the recalled womenwere collected. We compared mammographic characteristics, screening outcome andtumour characteristics between concordant and discordant recalls.RESULTS: There were 2,543 concordant recalls (71.4%) and 997 discordant recalls(28.0%). The positive predictive value of a concordant recall was significantlyhigher (23.5% vs. 10.0%, p < 0.001). The proportion of BI-RADS 0 wassignificantly higher in the discordant recall group (75.7% vs. 56.3%, p < 0.001).Discordant recalls were more often an asymmetry or architectural distortion(21.8% vs. 13.2% and 9.3% vs. 6.5%, respectively, p < 0.001). There were nodifferences in the distribution of DCIS and invasive cancers and tumourcharacteristics were comparable for the two groups, except for a more favourable tumour grade in the discordant recall group (54.7% vs. 39.9% grade I tumours, p =0.022).CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected cancers detected by a discordant reading show a morefavourable tumour grade than cancers diagnosed after a concordant recall. Thehigher proportion of asymmetries and architectural distortions in this groupprovide a possible target for improving screening programmes by additionaltraining of screening radiologists and the implementation of digital breasttomosynthesis.KEY POINTS: • With blinded double reading of screening mammograms,screen-detected cancers detected by a discordant reading show a more favourabletumour grade than cancers diagnosed after a concordant recall. • The proportions of asymmetries and architectural distortions are higher in case of a discordantreading. • Possible improvement strategies could target additional training ofscreening radiologists and the implementation of digital breast tomosynthesis in breast cancer screening programmes.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5586-9 PMID: 29943181
