In this study, aseries of nonsteroidal vitamin D mimics with phenyl-pyrrolyl pentane skeletonswith therapeutic potentials in cancer treatment were synthesized. Among them, 11band 11g were identified as the most effective agents in reducing the viability offour cancer-cell lines, particularly those of breast-cancer cells, with IC50values in the submicromolar-concentration range. In addition, 11b and 11gpossessed VDR-binding affinities and displayed significant partial VDR-agonistic activities determined by dual-luciferase-reporter assays andhuman-leukemia-cell-line (HL-60)-differentiation assays. Furthermore, 11b and 11ginhibited tumor growth in an orthotopic breast-tumor model via inhibition of cellproliferation and induction of cell apoptosis. More importantly, 11b and 11gexhibited favorable pharmacokinetic behavior in vivo and did not increase serumcalcium levels or cause any other apparent side effects. In summary, 11b and 11g act as novel VDR modulators and may be promising candidates for cancerchemotherapy.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00106 PMID: 29518319
