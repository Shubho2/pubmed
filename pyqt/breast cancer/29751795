KRAS mutated cancer cells were recently shown torely on GOT1 to support long-term cell proliferation. The aim of the presentstudy was to address the role of GOT1 in the metabolic adaption of cancer cells.METHODS: GOT1-null and knockdown cell lines were established through CRISPR/Cas9 and shRNA techniques. The growth properties, colony formation ability, autophagy and selected gene expression profiles were analysed. Glucose deprivationdecreased the viability of the GOT1-null cells and rescue experiments wereconducted with selected intermediates. The redox NADH/NAD+ homeostasis as well aslactate secretion were determined. GOT1 expression levels and correlation withsurvival rates were analysed in selected tumor databases.RESULTS: Inhibition of GOT1 sensitized the cancer cells to glucose deprivation,which was partially counteracted by oxaloacetate and phosphoenol pyruvate,metabolic intermediates downstream of GOT1. Moreover, GOT1-null cells accumulatedNADH and displayed a decreased ratio of NADH/NAD+ with nutrient depletion. Therelevance of GOT1 as a potential target in cancer therapy was supported by a lungadenocarcinoma RNA-seq data set as well as the GEO:GSE database of metastaticmelanoma where GOT1 expression was increased. High levels of GOT1 were furtherlinked to poor survival as analysed by the GEPIA web tool, in thyroid and breast carcinoma and in lung adenocarcinoma.CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests an important role of GOT1 to coordinate theglycolytic and the oxidative phosphorylation pathways in KRAS mutated cancercells. GOT1 is crucial to provide oxaloacetate at low glucose levels, likely tomaintain the redox homeostasis. Our data suggest GOT1 as a possible target incancer therapy.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4443-1 PMCID: PMC5948873PMID: 29751795
