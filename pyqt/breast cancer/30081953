The composition and functional capacity of gutmicrobiota associated with breast cancer have not been studied systematically.METHODS: We performed a comprehensive shotgun metagenomic analysis of 18premenopausal breast cancer patients, 25 premenopausal healthy controls, 44postmenopausal breast cancer patients, and 46 postmenopausal healthy controls.RESULTS: Microbial diversity was higher in breast cancer patients than incontrols. Relative species abundance in gut microbiota did not differsignificantly between premenopausal breast cancer patients and premenopausalcontrols. In contrast, relative abundance of 45 species differed significantlybetween postmenopausal patients and postmenopausal controls: 38 species wereenriched in postmenopausal patients, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiellasp_1_1_55, Prevotella amnii, Enterococcus gallinarum, Actinomyces sp. HPA0247,Shewanella putrefaciens, and Erwinia amylovora, and 7 species were less abundant in postmenopausal patients, including Eubacterium eligens and Lactobacillusvaginalis. Acinetobacter radioresistens and Enterococcus gallinarum werepositively but weakly associated with expression of high-sensitivity C-reactiveprotein; Shewanella putrefaciens and Erwinia amylovora were positively but weaklyassociated with estradiol levels. Actinomyces sp. HPA0247 negatively but weaklycorrelated with CD3+CD8+ T cell numbers. Further characterization of metagenomefunctional capacity indicated that the gut metagenomes of postmenopausal breastcancer patients were enriched in genes encoding lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, iron complex transport system, PTS system, secretion system, and beta-oxidation.CONCLUSION: The composition and functions of the gut microbial community differbetween postmenopausal breast cancer patients and healthy controls. The gutmicrobiota may regulate or respond to host immunity and metabolic balance. Thus, while cause and effect cannot be determined, there is a reproducible change inthe microbiota of treatment-naive patients relative to matched controls.DOI: 10.1186/s40168-018-0515-3 PMCID: PMC6080540PMID: 30081953
