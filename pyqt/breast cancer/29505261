To date, however, AFM-measured antibody-antigeninteractions have yet to be exploited to predict in vivo tumor specificity ofantibody-directed nanomedicines. In this study, we have utilized AFM to directly measure the biomechanical interaction between live triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and an antibody against ICAM1, a recently identified TNBC target.For the first time, we provide proof-of-principle evidence that in vitro TNBCcell-ICAM1 antibody binding force measured by AFM on live cells more preciselycorrelates with in vivo tumor accumulation and therapeutic efficacy of ICAM1antibody-directed liposomes than ICAM1 gene and surface protein overexpressionlevels. These studies demonstrate that live cell-antibody binding forcemeasurements may be used as a novel in vitro metric for predicting the in vivotumor recognition of antibody-directed nanomedicines.DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b04801 PMID: 29505261
