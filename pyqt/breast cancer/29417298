Although there have been advances in the treatment ofhormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positivebreast cancers, targeted therapies for TNBC remain unavailable. In this narrativereview, we summarize recent discoveries related to the underlying biology of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mechanistic target ofrapamycin (mTOR) pathway in TNBC, examine clinical progress to date, and suggest rational future approaches for investigational therapies in TNBC.RESULTS: As with other subtypes of breast cancer, aberrations in thePI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are common in TNBC. Preclinical data support the notionthat these aberrations predict TNBC inhibition by targeted agents. In a recently published phase 2 clinical trial, an AKT inhibitor (ipatasertib) improvedoutcomes in a subset of patients with metastatic TNBC when combined withpaclitaxel in the first-line setting. In addition, new compounds with distinctspecificity and potency targeting different PI3K/AKT/mTOR components and cognate molecules (e.g., mitogen-activated protein kinase) are being developed. Theseagents present a wide range of toxicity profiles and early efficacy signals,which must be considered prior to the advancement of new agents in later-phaseclinical trials.CONCLUSIONS: The development of drugs targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway for thetreatment of TNBC is an evolving field that should take into account theefficacies and toxicities of new agents in addition to their interactions withdifferent cancer pathways.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4697-y PMID: 29417298
