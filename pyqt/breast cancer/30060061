LY3039478 is a novel, potent Notchinhibitor decreases Notch signaling and its downstream biologic effects. In this first-in-human study, we report the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) profile,pharmacodynamic effects, and antitumor activity of LY3039478 in patients withadvanced or metastatic cancer.Methods: This phase I, open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized, anddose-escalation phase study determined and confirmed the recommended phase IIdose of LY3039478 (oral dose: 2.5-100 mg, TIW on a 28-day cycle). The primaryobjectives are to determine (part A) and confirm (part B) a recommended phase II dose that may be safely administered to patients with advanced or metastaticcancer, and secondary objectives include evaluation of safety, tolerability, PKparameters, and preliminary antitumor activity of LY3039478.Results: A total of 110 patients were treated with LY3039478 monotherapy between 31 October 2012 and 15 July 2016. Dose-limiting toxicities were thrombocytopenia,colitis and nausea. Most adverse events were gastrointestinal. The recommendedphase II dose was 50 mg TIW, because of its better tolerability compared to75 mg. The pharmacokinetics of LY3039478 appeared dose proportional.Pharmacodynamic data indicate an approximately 80% inhibition of plasma Aβ, and>50% inhibition of Notch-regulated genes hairy and enhancer of split-1, cyclin D1and Notch-regulated ankyrin repeat at 45-to 100-mg dose. Clinical activity (tumornecrosis, metabolic response or tumor shrinkage) was observed in patients withbreast cancer, leiomyosarcoma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma.Conclusion: Potent inhibition of Notch signaling by LY3039478 was well tolerated at doses associated with target engagement, and demonstrated evidence of clinicalactivity in heavily pretreated patients. Further investigation with LY3039478 as monotherapy and in combination with targeted agent or chemotherapy is ongoing.Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT01695005.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy244 PMID: 30060061
