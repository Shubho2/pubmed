Their participation in fundamental aspects of cellphysiology as well as their dysregulation in a number of pathologic conditionssuch as cancer have been documented. Among lncRNAs is actin filament associatedprotein 1 antisense RNA1 (AFAP1-AS1) whose elevated expression levels have beendemonstrated in different cancers. In the in the present study we evaluatedexpression levels of AFAP1-AS1 and its antisense protein coding gene AFAP1 inbreast cancer samples compare with adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) as wellas breast cancer cell lines with special focus on the assessment of theassociation between their transcript levels and patients' clinicopathologicaldata. AFAP1-AS1 has shown significant up-regulation in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 compared with control sample. AFAP1-AS1 has been shown to be expressed in all of tumor tissues but 76% (39 out of 51) ANCTs. AFAP1 expression was notsignificantly different between tumor samples and ANCTs. AFAP1-AS1 has beendemonstrated to be significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues compared withANCTs (fold change = 4.65, P= 0.028). No significant correlation has beendetected between the levels of these two transcripts in tumor tissues (R=2 0.081)or ANCTs (R=2 0.115). No significant associations have been found betweenexpression levels of these genes and patients' characteristics. However, bothgenes were significantly down-regulated in Ki-67 negative tumor samples. Theobserved up-regulation of AFAP1-AS1 in tumor samples compared with ANCTs implies its involvement in breast cancer pathogenesis and potentiates it as a biomarkeror therapeutic target.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-170831 PMID: 29439313
