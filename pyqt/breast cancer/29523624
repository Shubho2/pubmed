Approval was based on data from ExteNET, a randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Women with early-stage HER2-positive breastcancer and within 2 years of completing adjuvant trastuzumab were randomized toneratinib (n = 1,420) or placebo (n = 1,420) for 1 year. The primary endpoint wasinvasive disease-free survival (iDFS), defined as the time between randomization date to first occurrence of invasive recurrence (local/regional, ipsilateral, or contralateral breast cancer), distant recurrence, or death from any cause, with 2years and 28 days of follow-up. The trial showed a statistically significanttreatment effect favoring neratinib with a stratified HR of 0.66 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.49-0.90, P = 0.008]. The estimated iDFS rate at 2 years was94.2% (95% CI, 92.6%-95.4%) in patients treated with neratinib versus 91.9% (95% CI, 90.2%-93.2%) in those receiving placebo. Diarrhea was the most common adverseevent (AE), with a 40% incidence of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, and represents themost common AE leading to treatment discontinuation. Other frequent AEs (>10%incidence) were nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, vomiting, rash, stomatitis,decreased appetite, and muscle spasms. Other than diarrhea, neratinib isassociated with a low incidence of severe AEs; toxicities are generallyreversible and manageable with dose interruptions, dose reductions, and/orstandard medical care. This article summarizes FDA decision-making and datasupporting the neratinib approval.
