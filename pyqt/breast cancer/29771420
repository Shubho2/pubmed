Based on the GEO database (GEO accession No. GSE6883), we detectedthe mRNA levels of IMP 1,2 and 3 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction(q-PCR) in CD44+CD24-ESA+ cell cluster and other breast tumor cell clusters.Besides, we measured IMP3 expression in microsphere of breast cancer, whichexerted more significant tumor stem cell properties. The effects of IMP3 onbreast cancer cell stem cell properties were studied by RNA interference andoverexpression approaches in vitro. Furthermore, we predicted and identifiedmicroRNA, which could target and regulate IMP3 from bioinformatics analysis, and verified the interaction by luciferase assays and rescue experiments.RESULTS: Previously reported data showed that IMP3 expression was significantlyupregulated in CD44+CD24-ESA+ cell cluster from breast cancer tissues. Besides,we found IMP3 had higher expression in mesenchymal cells rather than epithelialcells, which was also significantly elevated in SUM159 and T49D cell linescultured as microsphere rather than adherent cells or differentiated cells.CD44+CD24-ESA+ cell cluster proportion was significantly decreased aftersilencing IMP3 in SUM1315, and its ability to develop into microsphere wassignificantly inhibited. By re-expressing IMP3 in SUM315, we restored theself-renewal capacity and tumorigenesis potential of SUM315. Through relativepredicting website, we found several miRNAs which could regulate IMP3. miR-34awith highest score was chosen for further analysis. Mimicking miR-34asignificantly downregulated IMP3 expression and inhibited its ability to develop into microsphere, while overexpressing IMP3 could rescue this process.CONCLUSIONS: IMP3 plays a vital role in maintaining stem cell properties ofbreast cancer cells, which could be regulated by mir-34a.PMID: 29771420
