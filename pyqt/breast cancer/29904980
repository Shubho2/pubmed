The EAR sampled 50 s of ambient sound every 9 minutes to estimate the frequency of noncancer conversation and reveal topics and types of conversation.RESULTS: Analyses revealed noncancer conversations comprised over 93% ofconversations. The most common topic discussed was people. Substantiveconversation was associated with better, while emotional disclosure wasassociated with worse, well-being for patients, but not spouses.CONCLUSIONS: Results revealed that ordinary conversations are frequent amongcouples who face breast cancer, and they are associated with patients'psychological adjustment, providing a foundation for potential interventions for coping with cancer that do not focus on illness.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4797 PMID: 29904980
