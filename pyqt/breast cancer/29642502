In this microfluidic chip, a3D microenvironment is engineered to culture metastatic breast cancer cells (MX1)in a 3D tumor model. A chemo-attractant was incorporated to stimulate motilityacross the membrane. We validated the usefulness of the chip by tracking themotilities of the cancer cells in the system, showing them to be migrating orinvading (akin to metastasis). It is shown that our system can monitor cellmigration in real time, as compare to Boyden chambers, for example. Thus, thechip will be of interest to the drug-screening community as it can potentially beused to monitor the behavior of cancer cell motility, and, therefore, metastasis,in the presence of anti-cancer drugs.DOI: 10.3390/bioengineering5020029 PMCID: PMC6027283PMID: 29642502
