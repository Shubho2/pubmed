The median follow-up period was 6.5years. The 5-year overall survival rate was 70% (95% confidential interval [CI]: 63-76] in arm A versus 73% (95% CI: 66-78) in arm B (hazard ratio = 0.92, 95% CI:0.55-1.41, p = 0.69). There was no significant difference in the 5-yearrelapse-free survival rate between arms A and B (56% versus 57% [hazard ratio =0.92, 95% CI: 0.63-1.34, p = 0.50]). Toxicities were well tolerated and there wasno treatment-related death. Toxicities of any grade or grade 4 were significantlymore frequent in the paclitaxel plus carboplatin group (95.7% and 22.1%,respectively) than in the UFT group (76.5% and 1.0%, respectively [p < 0.0001 in both]).CONCLUSIONS: As adjuvant chemotherapy, paclitaxel plus carboplatin was no better than UFT in terms of survival among patients with stage IB to IIIA NSCLC tumorswho underwent complete resection (UMIN000000810).Copyright © 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.Published by Elsevier Inc.
