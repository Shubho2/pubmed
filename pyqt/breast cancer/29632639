FUCA-1 gene is down-regulated inhighly aggressive and metastatic human tumors as its inactivation perturbs thefucosylation of proteins involved in cell adhesion, migration and metastases.Results: Negativity to FUCA-1 was significantly related to the development oflater recurrences in breast cancer patients with lymph node involvement atdiagnosis. Cancer specific survival of luminal B LN+ patients was influenced byFUCA-1 expression as luminal B LN+ patients with positive expression had a longercancer specific survival. FUCA-1 mRNA expression was inversely related to cancer stage and lymph node involvement. WB and qPCR analysis of FUCA-1 expression inbreast cancer-derived cell lines confirmed an inverse relationship with tumoraggressiveness.Conclusions: This study shows that, within LN+ breast cancer patients, FUCA-1 is able to identify a sub-set of non recurrent patients characterized by thepositive expression of FUCA-1 and that, within luminal B LN+ patients, theexpression of FUCA-1 predicts longer cancer specific survival.Methods: We have analyzed FUCA-1 in 305 breast cancer patients byImmunohistochemistry (IHC), and by qPCR in breast cancer patients and in breastcancer cell lines.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24445 PMCID: PMC5880599PMID: 29632639
