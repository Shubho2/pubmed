China.Tumor growth inhibition and adverse effect reduction together with metastasisalleviation are still the challenges that need to be overcome in cancerchemotherapy. Combinational therapy provides an alternative solution for thesechallenges. Nanoparticles are the ideal carriers for combinational therapy due totheir versatile drug loading capacities and versatile tumor-targeting strategies.In this study, a cRGDfk modified nanogel system has been utilized to coloadlidocaine, a voltage-gated Na+ channels inhibitor, and cisplatin, a commonanticancer drug to obtain a tumor-targeted dual drugs-loaded nanogel system. The introduction of lidocaine not only promotes the cisplatin-induced apoptosis invitro and in vivo but also alleviates the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in the mouse model. Besides, the body weight loss caused by cisplatin hasalso been relieved, and higher dose with less body weight loss can be achieved,which indicated the adverse effect caused by cisplatin-mediated chemotherapy has been alleviated. Furthermore, the introduction of peptide segment-cRGDfk, whichpresents high affinity to αvβ3 integrin, further increases the enrichment ofdrug-loaded nanogel in the tumor site. It favors the primary tumor growthinhibition. The results demonstrate the coloading of lidocaine and cisplatin byligand-modified nanogels is a promising strategy for αvβ3 integrin-overexpressingbreast cancer combinational therapy.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b09376 PMID: 29979563
