[Epub ahead ofprint]Sphingofungins G and H: new five-membered lactones from Aspergillus penicilliodesSpeg.Zhang H(1)(2), Zhu HT(1), Wang D(1), Yang CR(1), Zhang YJ(1)(3).Author information: (1)a State Key Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Plant Resources in West China ,Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Kunming , China.(2)b College of Life Sciences , University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ,Beijing , China.(3)c Yunnan Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry , Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Kunming , China.Two new sphingofungins G (1) and H (2) with a five-membered lactone ring wereidentified from the solid-state fermentation of Aspergillus penicilliodes Speg., a dominant microorganism isolated previously from the post-fermentation of ripePu-er tea, together with six known metabolites. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods. All of them were isolated from the myceliaculture of A. penicilliodes for the first time. The known compound, trypacidin,exhibited potent cytotoxities against five human cancer cell lines, e.g. myeloid leukemia HL-60, lung cancer A-549, hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC7721, breastcancer MCF-7, and colon cancer SW480, with IC50 values of 0.55, 11.45, 10.95,3.58, and 3.49 μM, resp., while cisplatin as the positive control, with IC50values of 8.63, 24.15, 21.99, 27.29, and 23.61 μM, resp.DOI: 10.1080/14786419.2018.1470627 PMID: 29745730
