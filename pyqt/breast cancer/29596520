An important step in the shift to a pro-cancerous microenvironment is thetransformation of normal stromal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are present in a majority of solid tumors and can directly promotetumor cell motility via cytokine, chemokine and growth factor secretion into the TME. The exact effects that the TME has upon cytoskeletal regulation in motiletumor cells remain enigmatic. The conserved formin family of cytoskeletonregulating proteins plays an essential role in the assembly and/or bundling ofunbranched actin filaments. Mammalian Diaphanous-related formin 2(mDia2/DIAPH3/Drf3/Dia) assembles a dynamic F-actin cytoskeleton that underliestumor cell migration and invasion. We therefore sought to understand whetherCAF-derived chemokines impact breast tumor cell motility through modification of the formin-assembled F-actin cytoskeleton. In MDA-MB-231 cells, conditioned media(CM) from WS19T CAFs, a human breast tumor-adjacent CAF line, significantly androbustly increased wound closure and invasion relative to normal human mammaryfibroblast (HMF)-CM. WS19T-CM also promoted proteasome-mediated mDia2 degradationin MDA-MB-231 cells relative to control HMF-CM and WS21T CAF-CM, a breast CAFcell line that failed to promote robust MDA-MB-231 migration. Cytokine arrayanalysis of CM identified up-regulated secreted factors in WS19T relative tocontrol WS21T CM. We identified CXCL12 as a CM factor influencing loss of mDia2protein while increasing MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Our data suggest a mechanism whereby CAFs promote tumor cell migration and invasion through CXCL12 secretionto regulate the mDia2-directed cytoskeleton in breast tumor cells.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0195278 PMCID: PMC5875872PMID: 29596520  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
