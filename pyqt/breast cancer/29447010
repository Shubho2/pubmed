Epub2018 Feb 15.Role of breast density measurement in screening for breast cancer.McLean KE(1), Stone J(1).Author information: (1)a Centre for Genetic Origins of Health and Disease , Curtin University and TheUniversity of Western Australia , Perth , WA , Australia.Mammographic breast density is an established risk factor for breast cancer andsignificantly reduces the sensitivity of mammography, yet its use within breastcancer screening programs in Australia is limited. We provide a contemporarysnapshot of the role of breast density measurement in screening for breast cancerand review the recent evidence for an increasing role of breast densitymeasurement as: a predictor of breast cancer risk, a predictor of 'masking', and a biomarker to monitor effectiveness of intervention strategies for primaryprevention or improved breast cancer outcomes.DOI: 10.1080/13697137.2018.1424816 PMID: 29447010
