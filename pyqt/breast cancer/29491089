Data on additional ML-I treatments were reported for 164 patients. Wedeveloped a "similar case" method with a distance measure retrieved from the betavariable in Cox regression to compare these patients, after stage adjustment,with their non-ML-1 treated counterparts in order to answer three hypothesesconcerning overall survival, recurrence free survival and life quality.RESULTS: Raw data analysis of an additional ML-I treatment yielded a worseoutcome (p=0.02) for patients with ML treatment, possibly due to a bias inherent in the ML-I-treated patients. Using the "similar case" method (a case-basedreasoning approach) we could not confirm this harm for patients using ML-I.Analysis of life quality data did not demonstrate reliable differences betweenpatients treated with ML-I treatment and those without proven ML-I treatment.CONCLUSION: Based on a "similar case" model we did not observe any differences inthe overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and quality of lifedata between breast cancer patients with standard treatment and those who inaddition to standard treatment received ML-I treatment.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12388 PMID: 29491089  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
