Eachparticipant's treating radiation oncologist completed a survey assessing his orher perception of whether the patient was anxious or depressed.RESULTS: Prevalence estimates for likely depression (6.9-18%) and anxiety(17-33%) overlapped across the 3 measures. Overall, only 9.9% of patients (95%CI, 5.6%-16%) wanted to be offered psychological support. For depression,agreement between the HADS and ultrashort tool was fair (κ = 0.37, P < 0.0001);agreement between the HADS and clinician judgement was slight (κ = 0.14,P < 0.05). For anxiety, agreement between the HADS and clinician judgement wasnot significantly greater than chance alone (κ = 0.04, P = 0.33), and agreementbetween the HADS and ultrashort tool was moderate (κ = 0.49, P < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the important role that oncologyconsultations play in interpreting assessment tool results and responding toindividual patient's history and preferences for psychological support.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4736 PMID: 29663624
