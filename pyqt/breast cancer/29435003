China.The majority of tumors possess the features of hypoxia. It is generally accepted that hypoxia is a negative prognostic factor for cancer. Low levels of oxygen areable to modify basic cell metabolism status. Elucidating the basic response,including cell proliferation and migration, to hypoxia by cancer cells isimportant for understanding the role of hypoxia in the development of cancer. In the present study, CoCl2 stimulation was used to simulate hypoxia. A microRNA(miRNA/miR) array was used to systematically detect the changes in miRNAexpression profiles. Following treatment with CoCl2 for 12 h, 15 miRNAs weremarkedly upregulated and 10 miRNAs were markedly decreased compared with thecontrol. After 24 h CoCl2 incubation, 15 miRNAs were increased and 3 miRNAs were decreased compared with the control. Among them, 7 miRNAs were upregulated and 2 miRNAs were downregulated at 12 and 24 h following CoCl2 stimulation. Thepotential roles of these miRNA were reviewed and it was identified that themajority of them are associated with cell proliferation and migration. Additionalexperiments demonstrated that CoCl2 incubation inhibited the proliferation ofMCF-7 cells but promoted cell migration. miR-491 may be a key miRNA forhypoxia-inhibited cell proliferation, as it was identified that hypoxia inducedthe downregulation of B-cell lymphoma-extra large in a miR-491-dependent manner. As the target of miR-302a, CXCR4 may be a key protein for hypoxia-promoted cellmigration. In the present study, it was identified that in the early stage ofhypoxia, cell proliferation was inhibited but cell migration was promoted. These results support the hypothesis that hypoxia may be a driving force for tumor cellescape from the primary tumor site to other organs, or other sites of the sameorgan.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7636 PMCID: PMC5778814PMID: 29435003
