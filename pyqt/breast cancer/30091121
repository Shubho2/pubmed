Secondary outcomes included whether a woman reported that shediscussed the results of her mammogram with her primary care provider (PCP).KEY RESULTS: Relative to women in the control arm, women in the intervention arm had greater improvement in their knowledge of both their personal MBD(intervention pre/post 39.2%/ 77.5%; control pre/post 36.2%/ 37.5%; odds ratio(OR) 5.34 for change for intervention vs. control, 95% confidence interval (CI)3.87-7.36; p < 0.001) and risk of breast cancer (intervention pre/post:66.8%/74.0%; control pre/post 67.9%/ 65.2%; OR 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI)1.09-1.84; p = 0.01). Women in the intervention group were more likely than thosein the control group to report discussing the results of their mammogram withtheir PCP (p = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Brief, personalized videos following mammography can improveknowledge of MBD and personal risk of breast cancer compared to a legislativelymandated informational letter.
