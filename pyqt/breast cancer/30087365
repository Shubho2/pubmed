Tumors from TNBC patients are heterogeneous based on geneticvariations, tumor histology, and clinical outcomes. We used high throughputgenomic data for TNBC patients (n = 137) from TCGA to characterize inter-tumorheterogeneity. Similarity network fusion (SNF)-based integrative clusteringcombining gene expression, miRNA expression, and copy number variation, revealed three distinct patient clusters. Integrating multiple types of data resulted inmore distinct clusters than analyses with a single datatype. Whereas most TNBCsare classified by PAM50 as basal subtype, one of the clusters was enriched in thenon-basal PAM50 subtypes, exhibited more aggressive clinical features and had adistinctive signature of oncogenic mutations, miRNAs and expressed genes. Ouranalyses provide a new classification scheme for TNBC based on multiple omicsdatasets and provide insight into molecular features that underlie TNBCheterogeneity.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29992-5 PMID: 30087365
