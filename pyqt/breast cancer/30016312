The present study examined the number of patients in Poland who had been diagnosed with breastcancer through inpatient open surgical biopsy (OSB) and CNB by province. MATERIALAND METHODS This retrospective study used a health needs map to identify patientsin 2014 and partially in 2015 who had had OSB or CNB of the breast performed onan inpatient basis due to benign breast lesions and whose diagnosis had beenchanged from benign to malignant. RESULTS Among the total number ofhospitalizations (13 718 cases with OSB) due to benign lesions of the breast,1506 patients had their diagnosis changed to malignant, constituting 8.59% of newbreast cancer diagnoses across the country. The resulting diagnosis change frombenign to malignant varied significantly across provinces, from 5.3% to 23.4%.Among the total of 7205 hospitalizations in 2014 with CNB performed usingdifferent methods, there were 1574 malignancies, amounting to 8.9% of newdiagnoses in Poland. The use of inpatient CNB to diagnose breast cancer differed significantly across provinces, from 0.6% to 34.4%. CONCLUSIONS OSBs are toooften used to diagnose focal lesions in breast glands in Poland. In some regions,CNBs are too frequently performed on an inpatient rather than outpatient basis,thereby requiring an analysis of the quality of and access to modern diagnosticmethods.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.908658 PMCID: PMC6067033PMID: 30016312
