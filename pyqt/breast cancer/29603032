Because of limited data on normal breast tissue from healthy women, we examined associationsof reproductive history and established breast cancer risk factors with breasttissue composition and markers of hormone receptors and proliferation in a nestedstudy within the Karolinska Mammography project for risk prediction for breastcancer (Karma).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissues from 153 women were obtained by ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy as part of the Karma project. Immunohistochemical staining wasused to assessed histological composition of epithelial, stromal and adiposetissue, epithelial and stromal oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status, and Ki-67 proliferation status. An individualised reproductive scoreincluding parity, number of pregnancies without birth, number of births, age atfirst birth, and duration of breastfeeding, was calculated based on self-reportedreproductive history at the time of the Karma study entry. All analyses wereadjusted for age and BMI.RESULTS: Cumulated reproductive score was associated with increased totalepithelial content and greater expression of epithelial ER. Parity was associatedwith greater epithelial area, increased epithelial-stromal ratio, greaterepithelial ER expression and a lower extent of stromal proliferation. Increasing numbers of pregnancies and births were associated with a greater epithelial area in the entire study set, which remained significant among postmenopausal women.Increasing numbers of pregnancies and births were also associated with a greater expression of epithelial ER among postmenopausal women. Longer duration ofbreastfeeding was associated with greater epithelial area and greater expression of epithelial PR both in the entire study set and among postmenopausal women.Breastfeeding was also positively associated with greater epithelial ERexpression among postmenopausal women. Prior use of oral contraceptives wasassociated with lower epithelial-stromal ratio amongst all participants and amongpre- and postmenopausal women separately.CONCLUSION: Reproductive risk factors significantly influence the epithelialtissue compartment and expression of hormone receptors in later life. Thesechanges remain after menopause. This study provides deeper insights of thebiological mechanisms by which reproductive history influences epithelial areaand expression of hormone receptors, and as a consequence the risk of breastcancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4768-0 PMCID: PMC6022521PMID: 29603032
