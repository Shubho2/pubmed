Levy Place, Box1603, New York, NY 10029, USA.While gene expression data at the mRNA level can be globally and accuratelymeasured, profiling the activity of cell signaling pathways is currently muchmore difficult. eXpression2Kinases (X2K) computationally predicts involvement of upstream cell signaling pathways, given a signature of differentially expressedgenes. X2K first computes enrichment for transcription factors likely to regulatethe expression of the differentially expressed genes. The next step of X2Kconnects these enriched transcription factors through known protein-proteininteractions (PPIs) to construct a subnetwork. The final step performs kinaseenrichment analysis on the members of the subnetwork. X2K Web is a newimplementation of the original eXpression2Kinases algorithm with importantenhancements. X2K Web includes many new transcription factor and kinaselibraries, and PPI networks. For demonstration, thousands of gene expressionsignatures induced by kinase inhibitors, applied to six breast cancer cell lines,are provided for fetching directly into X2K Web. The results are displayed asinteractive downloadable vector graphic network images and bar graphs.Benchmarking various settings via random permutations enabled the identification of an optimal set of parameters to be used as the default settings in X2K Web.X2K Web is freely available from http://X2K.cloud.DOI: 10.1093/nar/gky458 PMCID: PMC6030863PMID: 29800326
