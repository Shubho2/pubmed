Specifically, melatonin was proven to inhibitcell growth of both androgen-dependent and independent prostate cancer cells,through various mechanisms. A number of melatonin derivatives have been developedand tested for their role in the prevention and treatment of neoplastic diseases.We recently proved the in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity of UCM 1037, anewly-synthetized melatonin analogue, on melanoma and breast cancer cells. Inthis study we evaluated UCM 1037 effects on cell proliferation, cell cycledistribution, and cytotoxicity in LNCaP, PC3, DU145, and 22Rv1 prostate cancercells. We demonstrated significant dose- and time-dependent UCM 1037antiproliferative effects in androgen-sensitive LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Data from flow cytometric studies suggest that UCM 1037 is highly cytotoxic inandrogen-sensitive prostate cancer cells, although no substantial increase in theapoptotic cell fraction has been observed. UCM 1037 cytotoxic effects were muchless evident in androgen-insensitive PC3 and DU145 cells. Experiments performedto gain insights into the possible mechanism of action of the melatoninderivative revealed that UCM 1037 down-regulates androgen receptor levels and Aktactivation in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19051505 PMCID: PMC5983593PMID: 29783631
