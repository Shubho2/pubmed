Thestandard histopathology of breast tissue, the primary means of disease diagnosis,involves manual microscopic examination of stained tissue by a pathologist.Because this method relies on qualitative information, it can result ininter-observer variation. Furthermore, for difficult cases the pathologist often needs additional markers of malignancy to help in making a diagnosis, a need thatcan potentially beÂ met by novel microscopy methods. We present a quantitativemethod for label-free breast tissue evaluation using Spatial Light InterferenceMicroscopy (SLIM). By extracting tissue markers of malignancy based on thenanostructure revealed by the optical path-length, our method provides anobjective, label-free and potentially automatable method for breasthistopathology. We demonstrated our method by imaging a tissue microarrayconsisting of 68 different subjects -34 with malignant and 34 with benigntissues. Three-fold cross validation results showed a sensitivity of 94% andspecificity of 85% for detecting cancer. Our disease signatures representintrinsic physical attributes of the sample, independent of staining quality,facilitating classification through machine learning packages since our images donot vary from scan to scan or instrument to instrument.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25261-7 PMCID: PMC5932029PMID: 29720678
