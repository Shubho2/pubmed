Subsequently, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network wasconstructed for these feature genes, and genes in this network was optimizedusing betweenness centrality algorithm in order to identify genes potentiallycorrelated with GC (named as GCGs). In total, 1202 feature genes were identified to be significantly associated with survival time and status of GC, among ofwhich, 65 genes were identified as a classifier that was able to recognizerecurrence and nonrecurrence GC cases with a high sensitivity and specificity,predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and area under thereceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Furthermore, the classifier wasable to reasonably classify tumor samples in GSE15459 into high and low recurrentrisk groups. Among those genes, a set of genes were predicted to haveinteractions (e.g. RHOA interacting with TGFBR1, PRKACA and PLCG1; TGFBR1interacting with TGFBR2) and be involved in pathways like MAPK signaling (e.g.TGFBR1 and TGFBR2), adherens junction (e.g. RHOA) and apoptosis (e.g. PRKACA).Thegenes in the classifier model may be related to GC recurrence, and the classifiermodel may contribute to the prediction of recurrent risk in GC.DOI: 10.4149/neo_2018_170507N326 PMID: 29788739
