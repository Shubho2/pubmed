It serves a crucial role inanti-apoptosis and tumor progression. MUC1 interacts with proteins in theextracellular matrix, at the cell membrane, in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of anticanceraction induced by novel berenil complex of platinum(II) (Pt12) together with amonoclonal antibody against MUC1 in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The effect ofcombined treatment on the concentration of selected markers of apoptosisincluding proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 associated X protein (Bax), caspase-8,cytochrome c and caspase-9, as well as selected proteins involved inintracellular signal transduction pathways including p53, phosphoinositide3-kinase and phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt) were analyzed. The resultsof the present study demonstrated that combined treatment may be a promisingstrategy in anticancer treatment and represents an alternative to monotherapy.All compounds used alone (Pt12, cisplatin and the anti-MUC1 antibody) increasedthe concentration of proapoptotic Bax, cytochrome c and caspase-9 in comparisonwith control, thus suggesting that they activated the mitochondrial apoptoticpathway. Pt12 alone significantly increased the concentration of caspase-8, whichis responsible for the initiation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. However,the strongest effect was observed following Pt12 (20 µM) treatment combined with the anti-MUC1 antibody (10 µg/ml). These two compounds together strongly induced apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells via the external and internal apoptoticpathways. It was also demonstrated that combined treatment based on Pt12 and the anti-MUC1 antibody significantly reduced p-Akt concentration.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7623 PMCID: PMC5776928PMID: 29434943
