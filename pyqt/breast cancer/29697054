Our goal is to predict theresponse of breast tumors to therapy using a mathematical model that utilizesmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data obtained non-invasively from individualpatients. We extended a previously established, mechanically coupled,reaction-diffusion model for predicting tumor response initialized withpatient-specific diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) data by including the effects ofchemotherapy drug delivery, which is estimated using dynamic contrast-enhanced(DCE-) MRI data. The extended, drug incorporated, model is initialized usingpatient-specific DW-MRI and DCE-MRI data. Data sets from five breast cancerpatients were used-obtained before, after one cycle, and at mid-point ofneoadjuvant chemotherapy. The DCE-MRI data was used to estimate spatiotemporalvariations in tumor perfusion with the extended Kety-Tofts model. Thephysiological parameters derived from DCE-MRI were used to model changes indelivery of therapy drugs within the tumor for incorporation in the extendedmodel. We simulated the original model and the extended model in both 2D and 3Dand compare the results for this five-patient cohort. Preliminary results showreductions in the error of model predicted tumor cellularity and size compared tothe experimentally-measured results for the third MRI scan when therapy wasincorporated. Comparing the two models for agreement between the predicted total cellularity and the calculated total cellularity (from the DW-MRI data) revealsan increased concordance correlation coefficient from 0.81 to 0.98 for the 2Danalysis and 0.85 to 0.99 for the 3D analysis (p  <  0.01 for each) when theextended model was used in place of the original model. This study demonstratesthe plausibility of using DCE-MRI data as a means to estimate drug delivery on a patient-specific basis in predictive models and represents a step toward the goalof achieving individualized prediction of tumor response to therapy.DOI: 10.1088/1361-6560/aac040 PMCID: PMC5985823 [Available on 2019-05-17]PMID: 29697054
