Objective response rate (ORR), progression freesurvival (PFS), overall survival (OS) , toxicity and adverse outcomes of apatinibmesylate treatment were evaluated by imaging examinations. Results: Totally, 24patients received apatinib mesylate at a dose of 500 mg QD. Out of the 24patients treated, complete remission (CR) occurred in none of the patients,partial remission (PR) in 10 cases, stable disease (SD) in 10 cases, progressive disease (PD) in 4 cases, and drug with drawal in 2 cases due to adverse outcomes.Treatment with apatinib mesylate resulted in an ORR of 41.7% (10/24), diseasecontrol rate (DCR) of 83.3%, PFS of 4.7 months, and OS of 8.0 months. Adverseoutcomes included proteinuria, high blood pressure, fatigue, hand-foot skinreaction (HFSR), hyperbilirubinemia, leukopenia, hair/skin pigmentationdecreased. Most of the adverse events were tolerable and can be controlled after symptomatic management. Conclusions: Single-agent apatinib mesylate demonstrated the good short-term efficacy for multi-drug resistant advanced breast cancer inpatients who previously underwent multiple line treatment failures. Adverseeffects were controllable after symptomatic management. Treatment with apatinibmesylate maybe a viable option when other treatment modalities failed.Publisher: 目的： 观察甲磺酸阿帕替尼治疗多药耐药晚期乳腺癌的临床疗效及毒副反应。 方法：回顾分析河南省肿瘤医院乳腺科应用甲磺酸阿帕替尼治疗多药耐药晚期乳腺癌患者24例，起始治疗4周后复查进行初评，以防疾病快速进展；非疾病进展者后续每8周复查，通过影像学检查观察甲磺酸阿帕替尼在多药耐药患者中的客观反应率(ORR)，无进展生存期(PFS)、总生存期(OS)以及不良反应。 结果： 24例接受甲磺酸阿帕替尼(500 mg，1次/d，口服)治疗的患者，均可评价病例，完全缓解(CR)0例，部分缓解(PR)10例，稳定(SD)10例，疾病进展(PD)4例；因不良反应停药2例，客观反应率(ORR)为41.7%(10/24)，疾病控制率(DCR)83.3%，PFS＝4.7个月，OS＝8.0个月。主要不良事件包括蛋白尿、高血压、乏力、手足皮肤反应、高胆红素血症、白细胞减少、毛发/皮肤色素减少、食欲减退等。所有不良事件经过对症治疗后，多数为可耐受和控制。 结论：甲磺酸阿帕替尼治疗多线治疗失败的晚期乳腺癌近期疗效较好，毒副反应可控，可在临床使用并研究其优化方案。.PMID: 29747313
