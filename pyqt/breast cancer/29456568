Despite major innovations inearly detection and advanced therapeutics, up to 30% of women with node-negative breast cancer and 70% of women with node-positive breast cancer will developrecurrence. The recognition that breast tumors are infiltrated by a complex arrayof immune cells that influence their development, progression, and metastasis, aswell as their responsiveness to systemic therapies has sparked major interest in the development of immunotherapies. In fact, not only the native host immunesystem can be altered to promote potent antitumor response, but also itscomponents can be manipulated to generate effective therapeutic strategies. Wepresent here a review of the major approaches to immunotherapy in breast cancers,both successes and failures, as well as new therapies on the horizon.DOI: 10.7573/dic.212520 PMCID: PMC5810622PMID: 29456568
