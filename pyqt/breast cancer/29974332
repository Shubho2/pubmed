Maria della Misericordia, 33100,Udine, Italy.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate excision histology outcome of B3a lesions diagnosed atimaging-guided core biopsy and assess whether clinical and radiologic featuresmay predict upgrade to malignancy.METHODS: A total of 153 B3a lesions (74 papillomas, 51 radial scars and 28fibro-epithelial lesions) that underwent surgical excision were assessed. PPV formalignancy in all B3a lesions and specific for each sub-category was evaluated.Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify association between clinical(age, family or personal history of breast cancer, symptoms), diagnostic findings(imaging modality, lesion size, final BI-RADS category) and final excisionoutcome.RESULTS: Eleven (7%) of 153 B3a lesions were upgraded to malignancy. Allcarcinomas diagnosed on excision were non-high grade DCIS. Following featureswere significantly associated with malignancy: lesions identified only onmammography (3/21; 14%), both mammography and ultrasound (7/44; 16%), lesionsize > 10 mm (10/74; 13.5%) and BI-RADS category 4-5 (8/29; 27.6%). The absenceof residual microcalcification after biopsy was associated with decreased riskfor malignancy (15/16[93.7%]; p = 0.0297). Lesion size > 10 mm (OR = 9.3832; 95%;p = 0.0398) and BI-RADS category 4-5 (OR = 12.6004; 95%; p = 0.0006) were foundto be independent predictors of upgrade to malignancy.CONCLUSIONS: B3a lesions are associated with low risk of malignancy at excision. Lesion size > 10 mm and BI-RADS 4-5 category may represent useful predictors ofupgrade to malignancy.DOI: 10.1007/s11547-018-0914-3 PMID: 29974332
