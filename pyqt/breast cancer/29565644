[Epub ahead ofprint]Deep learning beyond cats and dogs: recent advances in diagnosing breast cancerwith deep neural networks.Burt JR(1)(2), Torosdagli N(2), Khosravan N(2), RaviPrakash H(2), Mortazi A(2),Tissavirasingham F(1), Hussein S(2), Bagci U(2).Author information: (1)1 Department of Radiology, Florida Hospital , Orlando, FL , USA.(2)2 Department of Computer Science, Center for Research in Computer Vision,University of Central Florida (UCF) , Orlando, FL , USA.Deep learning has demonstrated tremendous revolutionary changes in the computing industry and its effects in radiology and imaging sciences have begun todramatically change screening paradigms. Specifically, these advances haveinfluenced the development of computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD)systems. These technologies have long been thought of as "second-opinion" toolsfor radiologists and clinicians. However, with significant improvements in deepneural networks, the diagnostic capabilities of learning algorithms areapproaching levels of human expertise (radiologists, clinicians etc.), shiftingthe CAD paradigm from a "second opinion" tool to a more collaborative utility.This paper reviews recently developed CAD systems based on deep learningtechnologies for breast cancer diagnosis, explains their superiorities withrespect to previously established systems, defines the methodologies behind theimproved achievements including algorithmic developments, and describes remainingchallenges in breast cancer screening and diagnosis. We also discuss possiblefuture directions for new CAD models that continue to change as artificialintelligence algorithms evolve.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20170545 PMID: 29565644
