We studied the clinical utility of programmed death ligand-1(PD-L1) and other available factors in predicting clinical outcome in TNBC.METHODS: Of the 539 patients with newly diagnosed TNBC between 2004 and 2011, we analyzed 117 patients who had both tumor samples which PD-L1 protein expressioncould be evaluated using immunohistochemistry and initial stagingF-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) data to findavailable immunologic or metabolic factors. Median follow-up duration was 53months.RESULTS: Strong PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with increased riskof recurrence along with tumor hypermetabolism. The systemic recurrence rate was significantly higher in the strong PD-L1 group than the weak PD-L1 group (35% vs.11%; P=0.002); whereas there was no difference in locoregional failures (8% vs.8%). Meanwhile, tumor hypermetabolism seemed to relate with an increase inoverall recurrences (26% vs. 8%; P=0.019), not with specific type (locoregional, 9% vs. 3% [P=0.289]; systemic, 22% vs. 8% [P=0.051]). The relationship betweenPD-L1 expression and survival outcomes retained significance even after adjustingpotential risk factors.CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 and tumor metabolism might have role of predicting an increasein treatment failures. Especially, strong PD-L1 expression status was related to distant metastasis-dominant recurrence pattern which needs for intensive systemictherapy.DOI: 10.1097/COC.0000000000000426 PMID: 29419531
