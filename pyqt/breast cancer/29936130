Eligibility criteria includedinvasive carcinoma ≤2.0 cm or ductal carcinoma in situ ≤3.0 cm, ER positive (ifinvasive), lymph node negative, LVI absent, and margins negative by 2 mm.Patients received a total dose of 28.5 Gy in five daily fractions. NIBB wasdelivered using two orthogonal axes for each fraction. Applicators were selected to encompass the lumpectomy cavity with a 1.0 cm clinical target volume marginand 0 to 0.5 cm planning target volume margin. Acute and late toxicity wasassessed based on CTCAE v3.0.RESULTS: Forty patients with a mean age of 67 years underwent protocol treatment.Mean tumor size was 1.0 cm (0.3-2.0 cm). Eighty percent had invasive carcinomaand the remainder had ductal carcinoma in situ. Mean tumor bed volume was 21 cc(5-79 cc) and mean breast volume was 1319 cc (499-3044 cc). Mean breastseparation with compression was 6.7 cm (3.5-8.9 cm). All patients tolerated well.Median discomfort with compression was 1 (range: 0-7) on a 10-point pain scale.Acute skin reaction was Grade 0-1 in 70%, Grade 2 in 28%, and Grade 3 in 3%.Acute skin toxicity was not associated with breast size but was associated withlarger breast separation with compression (p < 0.01) and larger applicator size(p < 0.01). No Grade 3+ late toxicity or local recurrences have been observed at a median followup of 14 months.CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated partial breast irradiation delivered using NIBB overfive daily fractions is a convenient treatment option that is feasible and welltolerated.Copyright © 2018 American Brachytherapy Society.
