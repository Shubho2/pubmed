China.(2)Department of Clinical Laboratory, Xiangyang Central Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, Hubei 441021, P.R.China.p60 is a subunit of katanin involved in microtubule-severing. Previous studies ofp60 were primarily focused on microtubule regulation and cell cycle regulation.More recent research has demonstrated that katanin p60 possesses a function inprostate cancer bone metastasis; however, its role in breast cancer bonemetastasis remains unclear. In the present study, immunohistochemistry was usedto analyze the expression of katanin p60 in primary and bone metastatic breastcancer. The role of up- and downregulated katanin p60 was investigated using cellproliferation, and migration experiments. Overall, katanin p60 was highlyexpressed in breast cancer bone metastatic tissue compared with primary tumortissue. In breast cancer cells, overexpression of katanin p60 inhibited cellproliferation, but promoted cell migration, whereas silencing katanin p60expression promoted cell proliferation but inhibited cell migration. Overall, thepresent study indicated that katanin p60 serves a role in cell proliferation and migration, and thus may be a novel therapeutic target for prevention of breastcancer metastasis.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7942 PMCID: PMC5840750PMID: 29552132
