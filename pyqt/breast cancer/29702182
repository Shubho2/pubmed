Electronic address: stephen.mackessy@unco.edu.The present study highlights the cellular mechanism of resistance in humanadenocarcinoma (Colo-205) cells against apoptosis induction by Rusvinoxidase, an l-amino acid oxidase purified from Russell's Viper venom (RVV). The significantlylower cytotoxicity as well as apoptotic activity of Rusvinoxidase towardsColo-205 cells (compared to MCF-7 breast cancer cells) is correlated with lowerdepletion of cellular glutathione content and increased down-regulation ofcatalase activity of Colo-205 cells following Rusvinoxidase treatment. Exposureto Rusvinoxidase subsequently diminished reactive oxygen species (ROS) productionand failed to impair mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in apoptosisinduction resistance in Colo-205 cells. Further, higher expression levels ofcaspase 8, compared to caspase 9, indicate that Rusvinoxidase preferentiallytriggers the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in Colo-205 cells. A time-dependentlower ratio of the relative expression of Bax and Bcl-xL (pro- and anti-apoptoticproteins) in Colo-205 cells, compared to our previous study on MCF-7 cells,unambiguously supports a higher cellular resistance mechanism in Colo-205 cellsagainst Rusvinoxidase-induced apoptosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et BiologieMoléculaire (SFBBM).
