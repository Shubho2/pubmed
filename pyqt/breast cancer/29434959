Suturing is considered a major part ofpost-surgical recovery and may serve as a marker for evaluation of surgicaloutcome. The present study aimed to establish an effective means of suturing for patients who received modified radical surgery that helps to improve the cosmeticoutcome of the incision. Enrolled patients were divided into an active and acontrol group. Ti-Ni memory alloy wire for intradermal suture in the active groupand silk for interruption suture in the control group were applied to assess the different prognosis-associated factors. The Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) was usedto evaluate the wound size and the recovery time of the scars. The associationbetween diabetes and the number of days of wound healing was also analyzed. Theresults indicated that the mean VSS score of the active group was decreasedcompared with that of the control group (P<0.001). The VSS scores of four mainfeatures (vascularity, pigmentation, pliability and height) between the twogroups also statistically differed (P<0.001). Furthermore, the mean number ofdays of wound healing was significantly decreased for the active group comparedwith that for the control group (P=0.0026) in the patients with diabetes. Inaddition, the usage of Ti-Ni memory alloy wire was able to decrease the meannumber of wound healing days between patients with diabetes and theirnon-diabetic counterparts (P=0.7009). The present study indicated thatintradermal suture offers improved cosmetic outcome for patients undergoingmastectomy with or without axillary surgery. This technique may be useful forpreventing scar overgrowth and for facilitating the recovery process in patients with diabetes.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7603 PMCID: PMC5777371PMID: 29434959
