Methods: 245 newfemale cases of primary breast cancer confirmed by histopathology examinationwere sequentially recruited into the study. A total of 245 age-matched healthywomen were enrolled as controls during the same period. A standardizedquestionnaire was used to collect the demographic information of the subjects.Blood samples were collected and the levels of LEP and SLR in plasma weremeasured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The differences of LEP, SLR andFLI expression between control and cases group, as well as different breastcancer subtypes and TNM stages were compared using t-test and ANOVA afterstratification by menopause status. Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore the contributions of the three indexes to the risk of breast cancer.Results: Females in both cases and control group were (50.7 ± 9.4) years old. Thelevel of SLR and FLI (P(50)(P(25),P(75))) in premenopausal women were 18.4 (11.2,28.7), 0.5 (0.4, 0.6) μg/L in case group and 27.7 (19.2, 43.4), 0.3 (0.3, 0.4)μg/L in control group (P<0.001). While the level of postmenopausal women in case group were 20.3 (12.8, 31.8), 0.5 (0.4, 0.6) μ g/L (P<0.001), and 30.1 (18.8,40.5), 0.3 (0.3, 0.5) μg/L in control group (P<0.001), respectively. Afteradjustment for confounding factors and BMI, the relationship between FLI andbreast cancer remained significant for both pre- and postmenopausal women whilethe association between SLR and breast cancer was significant only inpremenopausal women. Compared with the lowest level of SLR, higer levels of SLRis associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (premenopausal women, OR=0.10,95% CI: 0.04-0.29, P(trend)<0.001). Compared with the lowest level of FLI, FLI athigher levels is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer(premenopausal women, OR=7.14, 95% CI: 2.86-17.83, P(trend)<0.001; postmenopausalwomen, OR=8.10, 95% CI: 2.85-22.98, P(trend)<0.001). No significant associationbetween LEP and breast cancer or association between the three indexes and breastcancer subtypes and TNM stages was found (P>0.05). Conclusion: SLR may be aprotective factor for breast cancer while FLI may increase the risk of breastcancer.Publisher: 目的： 探讨血浆瘦素、可溶性瘦素受体(SLR)以及二者比值游离瘦素指数(FLI)水平与乳腺癌患病的相关性。 方法：序贯收集经组织病理学诊断的原发性乳腺癌女性新发病例245例，并于同期按1∶1年龄匹配245名健康体检女性作为对照组。采用统一问卷调查收集研究对象基本信息并采集血样，采用酶联免疫吸附测定法检测血浆中瘦素、SLR浓度。按照绝经状态分层，采用t检验以及单因素方差分析比较瘦素、SLR和FLI在对照与病例组及乳腺癌亚型、TNM分期组间的表达差异，并采用多因素logistic回归分析三者与乳腺癌患病风险的相关性。 结果：病例与对照组女性年龄均为(50.7±9.4)岁，绝经前病例组的SLR、FLI水平[P(50)(P(25),P(75))]分别为18.4(11.2，28.7)、0.5(0.4，0.6)μg/L，P<0.001；对照组的SLR、FLI水平[P(50)(P(25),P(75))]分别为27.7(19.2，43.4)、0.3(0.3，0.4)μg/L(P<0.001)。绝经后病例组的SLR、FLI水平[P(50)(P(25),P(75))]分别为20.3(12.8，31.8)、0.5(0.4，0.6)μg/L(P<0.001),对照组的SLR、FLI水平[P(50)(P(25),P(75))]分别为30.1(18.8，40.5)、0.3(0.3，0.5)μg/L（P<0.001）。在调整混杂因素以及BMI之后，FLI与乳腺癌患病相关，SLR与绝经前乳腺癌的相关性差异有统计学意义。与最低水平的SLR相比，高水平组SLR与乳腺癌风险降低有关（绝经前调整OR=0.10, 95%CI:0.04~0.29,P(趋势)<0.001）；与最低水平的FLI相比，高水平组FLI组绝经前、后患乳腺癌调整后OR（95%CI）值分别为7.14（2.86~17.83）、8.10（2.85~22.98）,P(趋势)<0.001。瘦素与绝经前后乳腺癌的关联差异没有统计学意义（P>0.05）。 结论：SLR可能与女性乳腺癌的发病风险降低相关，而FLI可能增加乳腺癌发病风险。.PMID: 29973003
