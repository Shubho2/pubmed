Aptamers are one of the mostly usedand highly selective targeting agents for cancer cells. Herein, we address anano-sized targeted drug delivery approach adorned with A-172 glioblastomacell-line-specific single stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamer in which thechemotherapeutic agent Doxorubicin (DOX) had been conjugated. DNA aptamer, GMT-3,was previously selected for specific recognition of glioblastoma and represented many advantageous characteristics for drug targeting purposes. Flow cytometryanalysis proved the binding efficiency of the specific aptamer to tumour celllines. Celltype- specific toxicity of GMT-3:DOX complex was showed by XTT assayand terminated cytotoxic effects were screened for both target cell and a controlbreast cancer cell line. The result of this contribution demonstrated thepotential utility of GMT-3 aptamer-mediated therapeutic drug transportation inthe treatment of gliomas specifically. It was concluded that aptamer-mediateddrug delivery can be applied successfully for clinical use.PMID: 29485118
