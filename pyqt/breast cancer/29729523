Electronic address: mkwak@catholic.ac.kr.Cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) is the most common cancer stem cell (CSC)marker and high CD44 expression has been associated with anticancer drugresistance, tumor recurrence, and metastasis. In this study, we aimed toinvestigate the molecular mechanism by which CD44 and nuclear factor erythroid2-like 2 (NFE2L2; NRF2), a key regulator of antioxidant genes, are linked to CSC resistance using CD44high breast CSC-like cells. NRF2 expression was higher inCD44high cell populations isolated from doxorubicin-resistant MCF7 (ADR), as wellas MCF7, MDA-MB231, and A549 cells, than in corresponding CD44low cells. HighNRF2 expression in the CD44highCD24low CSC population (ADR44P) established fromADR cells depended on standard isoform of CD44. Silencing of CD44 oroverexpression of CD44 resulted in the reduction or elevation of NRF2,respectively, and treatment with hyaluronic acid, a CD44 ligand, augmented NRF2activation. As functional implications, NRF2 silencing rendered ADR44P cells toretain higher levels of reactive oxygen species and to be sensitive to anticancerdrug toxicity. Moreover, NRF2-silenced ADR44P cells displayed tumor growthretardation and reduced colony/sphere formation and invasion capacity. In linewith these, CD44 significantly colocalized with NRF2 in breast tumor clinicalsamples. The molecular mechanism of CD44-mediated NRF2 activation was found toinvolve high p62 expression. CD44 elevation led to an increase in p62, andinhibition of p62 resulted in NRF2 suppression in ADR44P. Collectively, ourresults showed that high CD44 led to p62-associated NRF2 activation in CD44highbreast CSC-like cells. NRF2 activation contributed to the aggressive phenotype,tumor growth, and anticancer drug resistance of CD44high CSCs. Therefore, theCD44-NRF2 axis might be a promising therapeutic target for the control of stress resistance and survival of CD44high CSC population within breast tumors.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
