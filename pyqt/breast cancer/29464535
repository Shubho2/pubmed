Extendedsurvival after hepatectomy was examined in a select group of BCLM patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hepatectomy for BCLM was performed in 139 consecutivepatients between 1985 and 2012. Patients who survived < 5 years were compared to those who survived ≥ 5 years from first diagnosis of hepatic metastases.Predictive factors for survival were analyzed. Statistically cured, defined asthose patients who their hazard rate returned to that of the general population, was analyzed.RESULTS: Of the 139, 43 patients survived ≥ 5 years. Significant differencesbetween patient groups (< 5 vs. ≥ 5 years) were mean time interval betweenprimary tumor and hepatic metastases diagnosis (50 vs. 43 months), mean number ofresected tumors (3 vs. 2), positive estrogen receptors (54% vs. 79%), microscopiclymphatic invasion (65% vs. 34%), vascular invasion (63% vs. 37%), hormonaltherapy after resection (34% vs. 74%), number of recurrence (40% vs. 65%) andrepeat hepatectomy (1% vs. 42%), respectively. The probability of statisticalcure was 14% (95% CI 1.4-26.7%) in these patients.CONCLUSIONS: Hepatectomy combined with systemic treatment can provide a chance oflong-term survival and even cure in selected patients with BCLM. Microscopicvascular/lymphatic invasion appears to be a novel predictor for long-termsurvival after hepatectomy for BCLM and should be part of the review whendiscussing multidisciplinary treatment strategies.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4714-1 PMCID: PMC5993851PMID: 29464535
