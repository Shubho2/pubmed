However, the clinical and prognostic significance of NLR inbreast cancer remains controversial.Aim: This meta-analysis was conducted to establish the overall accuracy of theNLR test in the diagnosis of breast cancer.Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search of the literature was conductedusing PubMed and Web of Science. Six studies dating up to July 2014 with 2267patients were enrolled in the present study. STATA 11.0 software (STATACorporation, College Station, TX, USA) was selected for data analysis. In orderto evaluate the association between NLR and overall survival (OS), disease-freesurvival (DFS), recurrence-free survival or cancer-specific survival, the hazard ratios (HRs), and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted.Results: Subgroup analyses showed that NLR was a strong prognostic factor for OS in multivariate analysis (HR = 2.81, 95% CI = 2.13-3.71, PH = 0.992) and without metastasis (HR = 1.45, 95% CI = 0.37-5.66, PH < 0.001). Elevated NLR wasassociated with a high risk for DFS in subgroups of multivariate analysis (HR =2.16, 95% CI = 1.67-2.80, PH = 0.977) and mixed metastasis (HR = 2.13, 95% CI =1.38-3.30, PH = 0.84).Conclusion: In summary, NLR may be considered as a predictive factor for patientswith breast cancer.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.160917 PMID: 29578155
