We sought to compare PSM rates for the ten most common solidcancers in the United States, and to assess trends over time. Over 10 millionpatients were identified in the National Cancer Data Base from 1998-2012, and 6.5million had surgical margin data. PSM rates were compared between two timeperiods, 1998-2002 and 2008-2012. PSM was positively correlated with tumorcategory and grade. Ovarian and prostate cancers had the highest PSM prevalencein women and men, respectively. The highest PSM rates for cancers affecting both genders were seen for oral cavity tumors. PSM rates for breast cancer and lungand bronchus cancer in both men and women declined over the study period. PSMincreases were seen for bladder, colon and rectum, and kidney and renal pelviscancers. This large-scale analysis appraises the magnitude of PSM in the UnitedStates in order to focus future efforts on improving oncologic surgical care withthe goal of optimizing value and improving patient outcomes.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-23403-5 PMCID: PMC5890246PMID: 29632347
