It works by disrupting the normal function of microtubules, thereby stopping cell division. Docetaxel is used in the treatment of ovarian, breast,esophageal, gastric, prostate, lung, and head and neck cancers. Common sideeffects include hair loss, low blood cell counts, peripheral neuropathy,vomiting, and muscle pain. Auricular chondritis with ear deformity has not beenreported previously as a side effect of docetaxel. In this paper, we present the case of a 64-year-old male patient with chondritis accompanied by ear deformitythat developed due to docetaxel-carboplatin chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer.DOI: 10.1177/1078155218762629 PMID: 29587605
