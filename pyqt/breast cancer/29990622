However, despite successful standardizationefforts visual TIL estimation is slow, with limited precision and lacks theability to evaluate more complex properties such as TIL distribution patterns.Therefore, computational image analysis approaches are needed to providestandardized and efficient TIL quantification. Here, we discuss differentautomated TIL scoring approaches ranging from classical image segmentation, wherecell boundaries are identified and the resulting objects classified according to shape properties, to machine learning-based approaches that directly classifycells without segmentation but rely on large amounts of training data. Incontrast to conventional machine learning (ML) approaches that are oftencriticized for their "black-box" characteristics, we also discuss explainablemachine learning. Such approaches render ML results interpretable and explain thecomputational decision-making process through high-resolution heatmaps thathighlight TILs and cancer cells and therefore allow for quantification andplausibility checks in biomedical research and diagnostics.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
