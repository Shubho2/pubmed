HepG2 cells were the most sensitivecells to the influence of the target coumarins. Compounds 13a and 15a emerged as the most active members against HepG2 cells (IC50 = 3.48 ± 0.28 and5.03 ± 0.39 µM, respectively). Compounds 13a and 15a were able to induceapoptosis in HepG2 cells, as assured by the upregulation of the Bax anddownregulation of the Bcl-2, besides boosting caspase-3 levels. Besides, compound13a induced a significant increase in the percentage of cells at Pre-G1 by6.4-folds, with concurrent significant arrest in the G2-M phase by 5.4-foldscompared to control. Also, 13a displayed significant increase in the percentageof annexin V-FITC positive apoptotic cells from 1.75-13.76%. Moreover, QSARmodels were established to explore the structural requirements controlling theanti-proliferative activities.DOI: 10.1080/14756366.2018.1477137 PMCID: PMC6022226PMID: 29944015  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
