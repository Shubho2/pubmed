In this study, cobalt ferrite magneticnanoparticles (CoFe-MNPs) were prepared by the co-precipitation method and their surfaces were modified with silica by the sol-gel method. The particle andhydrodynamic sizes, morphology and crystal structure of the bare andsilica-coated CoFe-MNPs were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM),dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The size of the bare CoFe-MNPs was in therange 8-20 nm and they were homogeneously coated with 3-4 nm silica shells. Thebare and silica-coated CoFe-MNPs were agglomerated at physiological pH. However, the sizes of the agglomerates were below 200 nm both in water and completemedium. The cytotoxic and genotoxic potentials of the bare and silica-coatedCoFe-MNPs were evaluated in a metastatic breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, as well as a noncancerous mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, by using XTTcytotoxicity, single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet), and cytokinesis-blocked(CB) micronucleus (CBMN) assays. Characterization studies with TEM, inductivelycoupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and Prussian blue stainingindicated that the CoFe-MNPs were internalized into the cells by energy-dependentendocytosis. The highest amount of uptake was observed in the cancer cells andthe uptake of the silica-coated CoFe-MNPs was higher than that of the bare onesin both cell lines. The bare CoFe-MNPs showed higher levels of both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than the silica-coated CoFe-MNPs. Moreover, the cancer cellsseemed to be more susceptible to the CoFe-MNPs' toxicity compared to thenoncancerous cells. There was a concentration and time-dependent increase in DNA damage and the micronucleus (MN) frequency, which was statistically significantstarting with the lowest concentration of bare CoFe-MNPs (p < 0.05), while nosignificance was observed below the concentration of 250 μg mL-1 for thesilica-coated MNPs. Also, the extent of both DNA damage and MN frequency was muchhigher in the cancer cells compared to the noncancerous cells. According to ourresults, the silica coating ameliorated both the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity aswell the internalization of the CoFe-MNPs.DOI: 10.1039/c6tx00211k PMCID: PMC6062407PMID: 30090464
