Several studies have demonstrated the anti-cell proliferative effect of androgen on endometrial cancer cells; however, the mechanisms of the anti-cancer effect of androgen remain largely unclear.17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (17β-HSD2), which catalyzes theconversion of E2 to E1, is known to be upregulated by androgen treatment inbreast cancer cells. In this study, we therefore focused on the role of androgen on estrogen dependence in endometrial cancer. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was foundto induce 17β-HSD2 mRNA and protein expression in HEC-1B endometrial cancercells. DHT could also inhibit cell proliferation of HEC-1B when induced byestradiol treatment. In 19 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (EEA) tissues,intratumoral DHT concentration was measured by liquid chromatography/electrospraytandem mass spectrometry and was found to be significantly correlated with17β-HSD2 immunohistochemical status. We further examined the correlations between17β-HSD2 immunoreactivity and clinicopathological parameters in 53 EEA tissues.17β-HSD2 status was inversely associated with the histological grade, clinicalstage, and cell proliferation marker Ki-67, and positively correlated withprogesterone receptor expression. 17β-HSD2 status tended to be positivelyassociated with androgen receptor status. In 53 EEA cases, the 17β-HSD2-positive group tended to have better prognosis than that for the negative group withrespect to progression-free survival and endometrial cancer-specific survival.These findings suggest that androgen suppresses the estrogen dependence ofendometrial cancer through the induction of 17β-HSD2 in endometrial cancer.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19041139 PMCID: PMC5979403PMID: 29642629
