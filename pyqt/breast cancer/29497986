This study compares the mortality of liver cirrhosis withthat of five major cancers (lung, colorectal, stomach, liver, and breastcancers).METHODS AND RESULTS: We used the National Health Insurance Service-NationalSample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) which provides data for 1,025,340 representative samplesof the 46,605,433 people in Korea from 2002 to 2010. During the 8Â years, 800 out of 2609 liver cirrhosis patients died and 1316 out of 4852 patients with the fivemajor cancers died. When we estimated the mortality between liver cirrhosis andfive major cancers, the relative mortality for liver cirrhosis was greater[hazard ratio 1.47 (95% CI 1.28-1.67) after age, gender, area of residence, type of insurance, insurance premium level (proxy for income level), and comorbiditieswere adjusted for]. When a sensitivity analysis was performed by excludingpatients with both liver cirrhosis and one of the five cancers, the relativemortality was still greater for liver cirrhosis [hazard ratio 1.27 (95% CI1.10-1.47)]. Furthermore, when we limited liver cirrhosis patients to those with decompensated liver cirrhosis, the relative mortality of decompensated livercirrhosis was even greater than that of the five cancers [hazard ratio 1.82 (95% CI 1.51-2.20)].CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of liver cirrhosis is greater than that of the fivemajor cancers. This implies the need to prioritize appropriate healthinterventions for liver cirrhosis.DOI: 10.1007/s12072-018-9850-5 PMID: 29497986
