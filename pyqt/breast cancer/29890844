Purpose To evaluate the role of strainelastography in downgrading Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)category 4a breast lesions according to personal risk factors for breast cancerin asymptomatic women. Material and Methods Strain elastography features of atotal of 255 asymptomatic category 4a lesions were classified as soft and notsoft (intermediate and hard). Malignancy was confirmed by surgery or biopsy, and benignity was confirmed by surgery or biopsy with no change on US for at leastsix months. Malignancy rates of lesions with soft and not soft elastography were calculated according to the presence of risk factors. Results Of 255 lesions, 25 (9.8%) were malignant and 230 (90.2%) were benign. Of 195 lesions in average-riskwomen, the malignancy rate of lesions with soft elastography was 1.5% (1/68),which was significantly lower than the 14.2% (18/127) of lesions with not softelastography ( P = 0.004). Of 60 lesions in increased-risk women, the malignancy rate of lesions with soft elastography was 15.0% (3/20), which was notsignificantly different from the 7.5% (3/40) of lesions with not softelastography ( P = 0.390). Conclusion In average-risk women, category 4a lesions with soft elastography could be followed up with US because of a low malignancyrate of 1.5%.DOI: 10.1177/0284185118780901 PMID: 29890844
