We used social network methods to examine variation in surgical delayacross physician peer groups and the association of this delay with groupcharacteristics.METHODS: We used linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare datato construct physician peer groups based on shared breast cancer patients. Weused hierarchical generalized linear models to examine the association of threegroup characteristics, patient racial composition, provider density (the ratio ofpotential vs. actual connections between physicians), and provider transitivity(clustering of providers within groups), with delayed surgery.RESULTS: The study sample included 8338 women with breast cancer in 157 physicianpeer groups. Surgical delay varied widely across physician peer groups(interquartile range 28.2-50.0%). For every 10% increase in the percentage ofblack patients in a peer group, there was a 41% increase in the odds of delayedsurgery for women in that peer group regardless of a patient's own race [oddsratio (OR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.73]. Women in physician peergroups with the highest provider density were less likely to receive delayedsurgery than those in physician peer groups with the lowest provider density (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.98). We did not find an association between providertransitivity and delayed surgery.CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of surgical delay varied substantially acrossphysician peer groups and was associated with provider density and patient racialcomposition.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4789-8 PMCID: PMC6048589 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29693229
