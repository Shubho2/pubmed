The assay describedherein has been validated for the detection of PGRN/GP88/GEP in blood (serum/plasma), urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and synovial fluid and may also be used for breast milk, ductal lavage, nipple aspirates, and saliva. The ability tomeasure circulating levels of PGRN/GP88/GEP has proven to have clinical utilityfor several human diseases such as cancer where changes of PGRN/GP88/GEP can bedetermined as a mean to monitor disease status or response to therapy. In thecase of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the ability to measure PGRN/GP88/GEPlevels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid may be useful in distinguishing PGRNmutation carriers among FTD populations at large. The assay used is a sandwichELISA where a highly specific antihuman PGRN/GP88/GEP monoclonal antibody isemployed as a capture antibody coated on 96-well microplates. After contact with serum (or other bodily fluid), unbound material is washed away before applicationof another PGRN/GP88/GEP detecting antibody which in turn is detected by ahorseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated antibody. After further washing to removeall unbound HRP, a substrate (TMB) is added, and after approximately 6 min, acolor is developed and can be read as optical density at 620 nm (or 450 nm ifusing HCL as a stop solution) in a microplate reader. The test described hereinis capable of measuring very low levels of PGRN/GP88/GEP such as 0.2 ng/mL asfound in CSF of certain FTD patients. Additionally, we have demonstrated thepotential clinical utility of measuring the changes of PGRN/GP88/GEP blood levelsin cancer patients undergoing therapy.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-8559-3_7 PMID: 29956271
