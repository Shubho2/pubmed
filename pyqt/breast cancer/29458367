Studies published on EBSCO, EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed, SpringerLink,ScienceDirect, Weipu, and CNKI databases were identified (last update was onNovember 3, 2015). Six articles focused on the association between CCL2-2518A/G(rs1024611) polymorphism, and gynecological cancer risk was selected and datawere extracted. The cancer type included endometrial cancer (n = 1), breastcancer (n = 2), ovarian cancer (n = 2), and cervical cancer (n = 1). Allstatistical analyses were performed using the STATA version 12.0 software.RESULTS: The meta-analysis showed that CCL2-2518A/G (rs1024611) polymorphism isassociated with risk of gynecological cancer (GG vs AG + AA, OR = 1.55,95%CI = 1.07-2.24, P < 0.05; AA vs GG, OR = 0.59 95%CI = 0.38-0.92, P < 0.05).Notably, the subgroup analysis demonstrated that the genotype AA is associatedwith a reduced gynecological cancer risk in Asians, but an increased risk whencompared to AG in Europeans.CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated the CCL2-2518A/G (rs1024611) polymorphism issignificantly associated with risk of gynecological cancer, and the associationdiffers by ethnicity.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1335-4 PMCID: PMC5819160PMID: 29458367
