Although important roles of sphingolipids in breast cancer progressionhave been reported in experimental models, their roles in human patients are yet to be revealed. The aim of this study was to investigate the ceramide levels and its biosynthesis pathways in human breast cancer patients. Breast cancer,peri-tumor and normal breast tissue samples were collected from surgicalspecimens from a series of 44 patients with breast cancer. The amount ofsphingolipid metabolites in the tissue were determined by mass spectrometry. The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to analyze gene expression related to thesphingolipid metabolism. Ceramide levels were higher in breast cancer tissuecompared to both normal and peri-tumor breast tissue. Substrates and enzymes thatgenerate ceramide were significantly increased in all three ceramide biosynthesispathways in cancer. Further, higher levels of ceramide in breast cancer wereassociated with less aggressive cancer biology presented by Ki-67 index andnuclear grade of the cancer. Interestingly, patients with higher gene expressionsof enzymes in the three major ceramide synthesis pathways showed significantlyworse prognosis. This is the first study to reveal the clinical relevance ofceramide metabolism in breast cancer patients. We demonstrated that ceramidelevels in breast cancer tissue were significantly higher than those in normaltissue, with activation of the three ceramide biosynthesis pathways. We alsoidentified that ceramide levels have a significant association with aggressivephenotype and its enzymes have prognostic impact on breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24903 PMCID: PMC5929433PMID: 29731990
