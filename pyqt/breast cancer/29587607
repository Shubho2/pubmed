[Epub ahead of print]Assessment of bleeding incidences associated with rivaroxaban therapy in adultswith solid tumors.Weddle KJ(1)(2), Kiel PJ(1), Patel PJ(2).Author information: (1)1 Indiana University Health University Hospital, Indianapolis, IN, USA.(2)2 College of Pharmacy, Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.Purpose Report bleeding incidences associated with rivaroxaban in adult patients with solid tumor malignancies requiring anticoagulation therapy. Methods Thisretrospective review was conducted at Indiana University Health, UniversityHospital and the Simon Cancer Center in Indianapolis, IN from January 2013 -February 2016. Patients were included if they had a solid tumor malignancy andprescribed rivaroxaban. Data were collected on 144 patients. Major bleeding wasdefined as bleeding requiring treatment (local, systemic treatment, blood celltransfusions) or hospitalization and minor bleeding was defined as bleeding notrequiring treatment or hospitalization. Results Sixty-four (44%) patientsexperienced bleeding while on rivaroxaban. There were six cancer types that had ahigher incidence of bleeding: bladder, breast, melanoma, pancreas, prostate, and renal cell cancers; 40% (6/15) of patients with bladder cancer experiencedbleeding; 54% (7/13) with breast cancer experienced bleeding; 40% (4/10) ofpatients with melanoma experienced bleeding; 58% (11/19) of patients withpancreatic cancer experienced bleeding; 45% (10/22) of patients with prostatecancer experienced bleeding; and 56% (5/9) of patients with renal cell carcinoma experienced bleeding. No other data collected identified increased incidence ofbleeding. Conclusions Patients on rivaroxaban with a diagnosis of bladder,breast, melanoma, pancreas, prostate, or renal cell cancers had a higherincidence of bleeding compared to other solid tumors. Major bleeding was higherin bladder, breast, pancreas, and renal cell carcinomas, while minor bleeding washigher in patients with melanoma and prostate cancer.DOI: 10.1177/1078155218765635 PMID: 29587607
