In 2013, the American Society of RadiationOncology (ASTRO) policy model recognized that stereotactic body radiation therapy(SBRT) may be used as an alternative to standard treatment modalities, i.e.intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), to treat prostate cancer. In thisstudy, we report outcomes for a cohort of 30 patients with prostate cancertreated with SBRT at our institution. We also describe, in detail, the technical aspects of SBRT planning and delivery for these patients, specifically the use ofMRI in determining treatment volumes and detecting gross lesions. Afterinstitutional review board (IRB) approval, a retrospective analysis was done of30 males with the diagnosis of prostate cancer treated in the Department ofRadiation Oncology at the Baylor College of Medicine between January 2011 andJune 2016. All patients received image-guided SBRT. Treatment planning wasperformed using a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan as well as acontrast thin-slice open MRI with the patient in the treatment position. Patient comparisons were done using the Mann-Whitney U, Fishers Exact, and Kaplan-Meiertests. Thirty patients were treated between January 2011 and June 2016.Twenty-six had follow-up data available and were included in the analysis. Medianfollow-up was 32 months (range 2-72 months). Mean and median ages at diagnosiswere both 68.5 years. A total of 64% of the patients had foci on magneticresonance imaging (MRI) or a palpable nodule on an exam. The medianprostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis was 7.35 ng/mL (range 2.8-13), andthe median PSA nadir after treatment was 0.4 ng/mL (range 0.01-4.5). Thebiochemical disease-free recurrence rate per Phoenix definition was 96%, withonly one patient experiencing a biochemical recurrence four years aftertreatment. The patient with a recurrence was T2c, high-intermediate risk with aGleason score of 7(3+4). He had a focus visible on MRI. Overall survival was 96%,with the only patient death unrelated to his prostate cancer. There was nostatistical significance associated with recurrence and nodule on MRI (p=0.318), T-stage (p=0.222), Gleason score (p=0.890), risk group (p=0.654), age (p=0.692), or race (p=0.509). There were no grade three or four acute or long-termtoxicities. SBRT of the prostate is an effective method for treating prostatecancer. We saw excellent PSA control and minimal acute or long-term toxicitiesafter a median of three years of follow-up.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2590 PMCID: PMC6037339PMID: 30009104
