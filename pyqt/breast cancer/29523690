Numerousinteractions between specific reader protein domains and histone PTMs and theirregulatory outcomes have been reported, but little is known about how readerproteins may in turn be modulated by these interactions. Tripartitemotif-containing protein 24 (TRIM24) is a histone reader aberrantly expressed in multiple cancers. Here, our investigation revealed functional cross-talk between histone acetylation and TRIM24 SUMOylation. Binding of TRIM24 to chromatin viaits tandem PHD-bromodomain, which recognizes unmethylated lysine 4 and acetylatedlysine 23 of histone H3 (H3K4me0/K23ac), led to TRIM24 SUMOylation at lysineresidues 723 and 741. Inactivation of the bromodomain, either by mutation or witha small-molecule inhibitor, IACS-9571, abolished TRIM24 SUMOylation. Conversely, inhibition of histone deacetylation markedly increased TRIM24's interaction with chromatin and its SUMOylation. Of note, gene expression profiling of MCF7 cellsexpressing WT versus SUMO-deficient TRIM24 identified cell adhesion as the major pathway regulated by the cross-talk between chromatin acetylation and TRIM24SUMOylation. In conclusion, our findings establish a new link between histone H3 acetylation and SUMOylation of the reader protein TRIM24, a functional connectionthat may bear on TRIM24's oncogenic function and may inform future studies of PTMcross-talk between histones and epigenetic regulators.Â© 2018 Appikonda et al.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.002233 PMCID: PMC5950014PMID: 29523690
