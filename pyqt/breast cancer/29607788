Russian Federation.BACKGROUND: The meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria (L.) Maxim.) may have a cancerprophylactic activity, since its extracts exhibits antioxidant, antiinflammatory and other effects. We investigated the ability of a meadowsweet decoction toinhibit mammary carcinogenesis induced by intramammary injections ofmethylnitrosourea (MNU) to the target organ in rats.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical composition of meadowsweet extracts wasstudied by traditional methods. In animal experiments adult outbred female ratsreceived single injections of MNU at a dose 1mg directly into the tissue of each mammary gland. After carcinogenic exposure one group (MNU) of rats continued toreceive standard feed and tap water throughout life. In another group(MNU+meadowsweet), rats were given daily a decoction of the meadowsweet insteadof drinking water and standard feed.RESULTS: Meadowsweet extracts showed a sufficiently high content of flavonoidsand tannins and also some individual phenolic compounds. In rats after injectionsof MNU the overall incidence of tumors was 90% with tumor multiplicity of 3.1.The majority of rats (86%) developed multiple malignant tumors of mammary gland(most often adenocarcinomas). In rats from the group MNU+meadowsweet there was a statistically significant decrease of the overall tumor multiplicity - by 1.5times, and the incidence and multiplicity of breast tumors - by 1.6 and 2.2times, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Meadowsweet extract can be considered an effective inhibitor ofbreast carcinogenesis.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1871520618666180402125913 PMID: 29607788
