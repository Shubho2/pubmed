China.Functional inactivation of human runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3)through mutation or epigenetic silencing has been well-documented in manycancerous entities. In addition to gene mutation and promoter hypermethylation,cytoplasmic mislocalization has emerged as another major manifestation of RUNX3dysfunction in malignancies including breast, colorectal and gastric cancers. Theaim of the present study was to investigate whether patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and different RUNX3 expression patterns would have different overall survival (OS), and the associations between different patterns ofclinicopathological parameters and clinical outcome. Expressions of RUNX3 andKi-67 were immunohistochemically detected in normal lung tissue (n=5) andsurgically resected tissues from NSCLC patients (n=188). The optimal cutoff ofRUNX3 was determined by X-tile software associated with their survival. Apoptoticindex in cancerous tissue was evaluated using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling method. The prognosticsignificance of different expression patterns of RUNX3 was determined by means ofKaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank tests. It was revealed that loss of RUNX3 expression in NSCLC was correlated with a low cancerous apoptotic index(P<0.001), shorter OS and worse prognosis (P=0.0142), while no statisticaldifference of apoptotic index (P=0.73) or survival (P=0.3781) was determinedbetween patient subgroups with different localization of RUNX3 expression, which was quite different from the situation demonstrated in other malignancies. Inconclusion, loss of expression rather than cytoplasmic mislocalization of RUNX3predicted worse outcome in NSCLC, which was quite different from what manifested in other cancer types, and thus, the underlying mechanism may deserve furtherinvestigation.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7993 PMCID: PMC5840764PMID: 29545901
