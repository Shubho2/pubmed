Electronic address:Carmen.Waengler@medma.uni-heidelberg.de.Radiolabeled heterobivalent peptidic ligands (HBPLs), being able to addressdifferent receptors, are highly interesting tumor imaging agents as they canoffer multiple advantages over monovalent peptide receptor ligands. However, few examples of radiolabeled HBPLs have been described so far. One promising approachis the combination of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)- and vasoactiveintestinal peptide receptor subtype 1 (VPAC1R)-targeting peptides into one singleradioligand since gastrinomas, prostate and breast cancer have been shown toconcomitantly or complementarily overexpress both receptors. Here we report thedesign and synthesis of different HBPLs, comprising a GRPR-binding (BBN7-14) and a VPAC1R-targeting (PACAP-27) peptide. The heterodimers were varied with regardto the distance between the peptide binders and the steric rigidity of thesystems. We radiolabeled the HBPLs 19-23 as well as their monomeric referencestandards 26 and 27 with 68Ga, achieving radiochemical yields and purities of95-99% and non-optimized molar activities of 25-61 GBq/μmol. We tested thestability of the radioligands and further evaluated them in vitro regarding theiruptake in different prostate carcinoma cell lines (PC-3, DU-145 and VCaP cells). We found that the heterobivalent substances [68Ga]19 - [68Ga]23 showed comparableuptakes into the tumor cells to those of the respective monomers [68Ga]26 and[68Ga]27, indicating that both peptides are still able to address their targetreceptors. Furthermore, the obtained results indicate that in case of overall lowreceptor densities, heterobivalent peptides surpass peptide monomers in tumorcell uptake. Most importantly, it could be shown by blocking studies that bothpeptide parts of the HBPL [68Ga]19 contributed to tumor cell uptake in VCaPcells, expressing both receptor types. Thus, we describe here the first examples of HBPLs being able to address the GRPR as well as the VPAC1R and have thepotential to - by several mechanisms - improve tumor targeting for severalmalignancies compared to monospecific peptides.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
