The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of proliferation,migration, and invasion after silencing TBC1D24 expression in breast cancer MCF-7cells, and to elucidate the potential mechanism of TBC1D24 in breast cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression of TBC1D24 in breast cancer tissues and theadjacent non-tumor tissues was determined by S-P immunohistochemistry. Themalignant behavior, including proliferation, migration, and invasion ability, wasdetermined after silencing TBC1D24 in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The expressionof IGF1R was determined after silencing TBC1D24. The expression of TBC1D24 andIGF1R was detected after transfecting miR-30a mimics or inhibitors. The effect ofTBC1D24 on MCF-7 cells growth in vivo was evaluated by a tumor xenograft study.RESULTS TBC1D24 expression was elevated and was associated with poor outcome inbreast carcinoma. TBC1D24 high expression was significantly correlated withunfavorable OS and RFS for breast cancer patients (p<0.05). Silencing TBC1D24inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of MCF-7 cells.TBC1D24 and IGF1R expression were decreased when transfected with miR-30a mimics.However, TBC1D24 and IGF1R expression were increased when transfected withmiR-30a inhibitors (p<0.05). Knockdown of TBC1D24 inhibited the expression ofIGF1R, PI3K, and p-AKT (p<0.05). Knockdown of TBC1D24 abolished tumorigenicity ofMCF-7 cells. The average volume and weight of tumors was lower after silencingTBC1D24 expression (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Silencing TBC1D24 inhibited MCF-7 cells growth in vitro and in vivo. TBC1D24 promoted breast carcinoma growth through theIGF1R/PI3K/AKT pathway. TBC1D24 is a potential therapeutic target for breastcancer.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.906736 PMCID: PMC6029514PMID: 29893377
