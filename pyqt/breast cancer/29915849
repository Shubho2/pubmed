This study recruited 128participants (50% control, 50% patients) and used Tetra-Primeramplification-refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction method for thedetection of missense SNP (rs11556770). The study measured LCN2 plasma proteinexpression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Results: The resultshave shown that 100% of the genotypes were normal allele (G/G). In contrast,the plasma level of LCN2 was considerably elevated among patients as compared to control (p=0.001), and higher in invasive ductal carcinoma patients (p=0.001).The LCN2 protein expression in plasma level was significantly elevated amongpatients, particularly who demonstrated invasive ductal carcinoma. Conclusion:There is no significant relationship between breast cancer patients and LCN2 genepolymorphisms   (rs11556770).DOI: 10.15537/smj.2018.6.22950 PMCID: PMC6058746PMID: 29915849
