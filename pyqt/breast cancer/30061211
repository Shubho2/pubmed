The aim of the study was to determine if certain cinnamic aciddimers (CADs) exhibit higher cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells than againstnon-tumorigenic cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: These dimers have not been explored, so far, due to their complex stereochemistry; cavitand-mediated photodimerization (CMP) method wasused to produce several CADs, which were tested for cytotoxicity, apoptosis andcell cycle inhibition.RESULTS: CADs such as ferulic acid dimer, 3-fluoro CAD, and 3, 4-difluoro CAD,were found to be more cytotoxic than their parent monomers. The most potentcompound, 3-fluoro CAD caused apoptosis and 'S' phase cell cycle arrest in cancercells.CONCLUSION: This study indicates an avenue for research for developing a novelclass of antineoplastic compounds that can be synthesized using an easy,economical method.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12749 PMID: 30061211  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
