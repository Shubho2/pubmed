We used genetic markers in a Mendelian randomisation framework toexamine whether obesity-related traits influence glioma risk. This methodologyreduces bias from confounding and is not affected by reverse causation.METHODS: Genetic instruments were identified for 10 key obesity-related riskfactors, and their association with glioma risk was evaluated using data from agenome-wide association study of 12,488 glioma patients and 18,169 controls. The estimated odds ratio of glioma associated with each of the genetically definedobesity-related traits was used to infer evidence for a causal relationship.RESULTS: No convincing association with glioma risk was seen for geneticinstruments for body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, lipids, type-2 diabetes,hyperglycaemia or insulin resistance. Similarly, we found no evidence to support a relationship between obesity-related traits with subtypes ofglioma-glioblastoma (GBM) or non-GBM tumours.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides no evidence to implicate obesity-related factorsas causes of glioma.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0009-x PMCID: PMC5931112PMID: 29531326
