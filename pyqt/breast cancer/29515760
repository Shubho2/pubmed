It has been described thatbreast cancer subtypes present metabolism differences and this fact enables thepossibility of using metabolic inhibitors as targeted drugs in specificscenarios. In this study, breast cancer cell lines were treated with metforminand rapamycin, showing a heterogeneous response to treatment and leading to cell cycle disruption. The genetic causes and molecular effects of this differentialresponse were characterized by means of SNP genotyping and massspectrometry-based proteomics. Protein expression was analyzed usingprobabilistic graphical models, showing that treatments elicit various responses in some biological processes such as transcription. Moreover, flux balanceanalysis using protein expression values showed that predicted growth rates were comparable with cell viability measurements and suggesting an increase inreactive oxygen species response enzymes due to metformin treatment. In addition,a method to assess flux differences in whole pathways was proposed. Our resultsshow that these diverse approaches provide complementary information and allow usto suggest hypotheses about the response to drugs that target metabolism andtheir mechanisms of action.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24047 PMCID: PMC5839391PMID: 29515760
