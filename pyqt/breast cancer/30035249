Kaplan Meiersurvival analysis was performed in our discovery set, in breast cancer patientsanalyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas, and in a separate cohort of 98 patients withMBC who underwent clinical genomic testing.Results: Significantly mutated genes (SMGs) varied by histology and tumorsubtype, but TP53 was a SMG in all three subtypes. The most SMGs in HR+ patients included PIK3CA (32%), TP53 (29%), GATA3 (15%), CDH1 (8%), MAP3K1 (8%), PTEN(5%), TGFBR2 (4%), AKT1 (4%), and MAP2K4 (4%). TP53 mutations were associatedwith shorter recurrence-free survival (P=0.004), progression-free survival(P=0.00057) and overall survival (P=0.003). Further, TP53 status was prognosticamong HR+ patients with PIK3CA mutations. TP53 mutations were also associatedwith poorer overall survival in the 442 HR+ breast cancer patients in the TCGA(P=0.042) and in an independent set of 96 HR+ MBC who underwent clinicalsequencing (P=0.0004).Conclusions: SMGs differ by tumor subtype but TP53 is significantly mutated inall three breast cancer subtypes. TP53 mutations are associated with poorprognosis in HR+ breast cancer. TP53 mutations should be considered in the designand interpretation of precision oncology trials.PMCID: PMC6050977PMID: 30035249
