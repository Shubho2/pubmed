The serum levels ofMMP-1 have been reported to be lower in breast cancer patients than healthysubjects. In the current study, we aimed at investigating the contribution of apolymorphism in the promoter region of MMP-1 to breast cancer in Taiwan.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MMP-1 rs1799705 polymorphic genotypes were genotypedamong 1,232 breast cancer patients and 1,232 healthy controls by the typicalpolymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology.RESULTS: The percentages of 2G/2G, 1G/2G, and 1G/1G for MMP1 -1607 genotypes were35.4, 40.6 and 24.0% in the breast cancer group and 34.1, 43.6, and 22.3% in the healthy control group (p trend=0.3025), respectively. The odds ratios (ORs) afteradjusting for age, smoking and alcohol drinking status for those carrying 1G/2Gand 1G/1G genotypes at MMP1 -1607 were 0.93 (95%CI=0.76-1.11, p=0.2390) and 1.01 (95%CI=0.77-1.23, p=0.7377), respectively, compared to those carrying thewild-type 2G/2G genotype. Supporting this finding, the adjusted OR for thosecarrying the 1G allele at MMP-1 -1607 was 1.03 (95%CI=0.91-1.18, p=0.8860),compared to those carrying the wild-type 2G allele. Our findings suggest that thepolymorphic genotypes at MMP1 promoter -1607 investigated in the current study,may not play a major role in determining cancer susceptibility to breast cancerin Taiwan. Other early diagnostic and predictive markers are urgently needed for personalized and precise breast cancer detection and therapy.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/invivo.11265 PMCID: PMC6000806PMID: 29695550
