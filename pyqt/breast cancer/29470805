Several retrospective studies in triple-negative breast cancer havereported conflicting results in overall survival in patients receivingneoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic therapy. This study aims to analyze outcomes of adjuvant versus neoadjuvant in patients with early-stage triple-negative breastcancer with and without BRCA germline mutations.METHODS: Patients with stage I or II triple-negative breast cancer who had BRCAtesting were identified from a prospective cohort study of 4027 patients.Clinical, demographic, genetic test results, chemotherapy, recurrence, andsurvival data were analyzed. Overall survival and disease-free survival wereestimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: 319 patients with stage I and II triple-negative breast cancer who meteligibility criteria were included in the analysis. 187 received adjuvantchemotherapy (58.6%) and 132 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (41.4%). 135 were BRCA positive (42.3%) and 184 were BRCA negative (57.7%). There was nosignificant association between overall survival or disease-free survival andtreatment with neoadjuvant versus adjuvant in the overall cohort. Furthermore,there were no significant differences between patient subgroups (neoadjuvant BRCApositive, neoadjuvant BRCA negative, adjuvant BRCA positive, and adjuvant BRCAnegative) with respect to either overall survival or disease-free survival.CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant versus adjuvant with standard anthracycline- andtaxane-containing regimens results in similar disease-free survival and overallsurvival among patients with stage I and II triple-negative breast cancerregardless of BRCA status. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether similarresults are observed with newer agents.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4727-9 PMCID: PMC5994186 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29470805
