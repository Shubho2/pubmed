Our study aimed to define the spatial arc of spread of coronary vessels in a radian angle.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed the records of 51 CT coronary angiographiesdone in our hospital from January 2016 to July 2016. Left anterior descending(LAD) and right coronary (RC) were contoured for each patient. In each axialsection, the radial spread of each artery was noted. A 5 mm brush tool was usedto join the start and stop angles for making the summated "coronary strips".RESULTS: Start and end angle of LAD with 95% confidence interval (CI) (inclockwise direction) were 23.9 ± 4° and 79.0 ± 6.6°, respectively. Mean LAD arclength ± SD (standard deviation) noted was 55.1° ± 7.7° (95% CI). For RC thesmallest start angle and the largest end angle in all patients was 297.6° and322.6°, respectively. RC start angle, end angle and arc length for 95% confidenceinterval were 322.2 ± 6.1°, 292.4 ± 11.6° and 29.8 ± 13.1°, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a measure of the radial spread of the coronaryarteries, especially from the perspective of breast radiotherapy. We haveproposed a new organ at risk (OAR) of coronary strip. This should provide an easyand cost-effective way to delineate the coronary vasculature in breast cancerpatients undergoing radiotherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00066-018-1299-x PMID: 29651533
