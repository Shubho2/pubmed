Here we provide evidence that miR-34a physically interacts with andfunctionally targets tRNAiMet precursors in both in vitro pulldown and Argonaute 2 (AGO2) cleavage assays. We find that miR-34a suppresses breast carcinogenesis, at least in part by lowering the levels of tRNAiMet through AGO2-mediatedrepression, consequently inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells and inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, miR-34a expression isnegatively correlated with tRNAiMet levels in cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we find that tRNAiMet knockdown also reduces cell proliferation while inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Conversely, ectopic expression of tRNAiMet promotescell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, and accelerates the S/G2 transition.Moreover, the enforced expression of modified tRNAiMet completely restores thephenotypic changes induced by miR-34a. Our results demonstrate that miR-34adirectly targets tRNAiMet precursors via AGO2-mediated cleavage, and thattRNAiMet functions as an oncogene, potentially representing a target molecule fortherapeutic intervention.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).
