This articlesummarizes the pharmacological properties of apatinib and reviews its clinicaluse in chemotherapy-experienced patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma,including gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA), or with other advanced cancerssuch as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, gynaecologicalcancers, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), thyroid cancer and sarcomas. As third-or subsequent-line therapy, oral apatinib significantly prolonged medianprogression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with placeboand had a manageable safety profile in Chinese patients with advanced ormetastatic gastric cancer or GEA participating in randomized, double-blind,multicentre, phase 2 and 3 trials. More limited evidence also supports it use as subsequent-line treatment in Chinese patients with other advanced or metastaticsolid tumours, including NSCLC, breast cancer and HCC. Further clinicalexperience and long-term pharmacovigilance data are required to more definitivelyestablish the efficacy and safety profile of apatinib, including its use incombination with other chemotherapy agents and its role in the management ofother types of advanced or metastatic solid tumours. In the meantime, given itsconvenient administration regimen and the limited treatment options and poorprognosis for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumours, apatinib is an important, emerging treatment option for adult patients with advanced gastricadenocarcinoma or GEA who have progressed or relapsed after chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s40265-018-0903-9 PMID: 29663291
