[Epub ahead of print]A bias for action in cancer screening?Scherer LD(1), Valentine KD(1), Patel N(1), Baker SG(1), Fagerlin A(2).Author information: (1)Department of Psychological Sciences.(2)Department of Population Health Sciences.Research that has explored public enthusiasm for cancer screening has suggestedthat the public may be overly enthusiastic about being screened with certaintests, and this has been attributed, in part, to lack of knowledge about therisks and benefits. In this article the authors considered the possibility thatsome people may be enthusiastic about screening even when they are informed andalso accept that the test unquestionably does not save lives. Two studies wereconducted, one that involved a nationally representative U.S. sample and another that involved an online convenience sample. All participants were asked whetherthey would want to receive a hypothetical screening test for breast (women) orprostate (men) cancer that does not reduce the chance of cancer death or extendthe length of life. Over half of participants wanted to receive the describedscreening test. Many people did not believe that cancer screening might not save lives, yet screening preferences were not due to disbelief alone. Results furthersuggested that cancer worry, reassurance, and a desire for health informationexplained variance in preferences for unbeneficial screening, adjusting forbeliefs about screening benefits, perceptions of screening risks, family history,perceptions of cancer risk, and demographics.
