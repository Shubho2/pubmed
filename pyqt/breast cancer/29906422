Some studies have suggested the use of CA 15-3in CSF (CA 15-3 CSF) to aid in the detection of LM. The purpose of this study wasto compare the performance of CA 15-3 CSF to cytology for the detection andtreatment monitoring of breast cancer LM.METHODS: CA 15-3 CSF requests between 2014 and 2016 were retrospectivelyreviewed. Fifty-two measurements from nine patients were from our health systemand had corresponding CSF cytology measurements. Concordance between CA 15-3 CSF and CSF cytology was calculated. For patients with quantifiable CA 15-3 CSF,sequential determinations of CA 15-3 and cytology were compared over time toassess correlation of CA 15-3 CSF concentration and cytology with disease status.RESULTS: At the time of initial testing, seven of the nine patients (78%) hadpositive cytology. Two samples (22%) had quantifiable CA 15-3, both of which werealso positive by cytology. The positive concordance between all cytology and CA15-3 measurements was 9% (2/22), while negative concordance was 100% (30/30).Sequential CA 15-3 and cytology measurements showed a decrease in CA 15-3 thatparalleled changes observed with cytology.CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients, CA 15-3 CSF performance was neithersuperior nor complementary to cytology for the detection of LM, nor did thecombination of CA 15-3 CSF and cytology improve performance over cytology alone.Copyright Â© 2018 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.
