This study aims to provideestimates of complete cancer prevalence in Italy by sex, age, and time sincediagnosis for all cancers combined, and for selected cancer types. Projectionswere made up to 2020, overall and by time since diagnosis.METHODS: Data were from 27 Italian population-based cancer registries, covering32% of the Italian population, able to provide at least 7 years of registrationas of December 2009 and follow-up of vital status as of December 2013. The datawere used to compute the limited-duration prevalence, in order to estimate thecomplete prevalence by means of the COMPREV software.RESULTS: In 2010, 2,637,975 persons were estimated to live in Italy after acancer diagnosis, 1.2 million men and 1.4 million women, or 4.6% of the Italianpopulation. A quarter of male prevalent cases had prostate cancer (n = 305,044), while 42% of prevalent women had breast cancer (n = 604,841). More than 1.5million people (2.7% of Italians) were alive since 5 or more years afterdiagnosis and 20% since ≥15 years. It is projected that, in 2020 in Italy, there will be 3.6 million prevalent cancer cases (+ 37% vs 2010). The largest 10-yearincreases are foreseen for prostate (+ 85%) and for thyroid cancers (+ 79%), and for long-term survivors diagnosed since 20 or more years (+ 45%). Among thepopulation aged ≥75 years, 22% will have had a previous cancer diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: The number of persons living after a cancer diagnosis is estimatedto rise of approximately 3% per year in Italy. The availability of detailedestimates and projections of the complete prevalence are intended to help theimplementation of guidelines aimed to enhance the long-term follow-up of cancersurvivors and to contribute their rehabilitation needs.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4053-y PMCID: PMC5807846PMID: 29426306
