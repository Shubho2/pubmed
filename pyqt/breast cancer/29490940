In patientswith luminal subtype, pCR seems less important for outcome prediction. BC is aheterogeneous disease, which is evident in residual tumors afterneoadjuvant-chemotherapy (NAC). This study evaluates changes in Ki67 in relation to disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients without pCR.SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: Four hundred thirty-five patients with stageIIA-IIIC BC without pCR after standard NAC with anthracycline and paclitaxel wereanalyzed. We analyzed the decrease or lack of decrease in the percentage ofKi67-positive cells between core biopsy samples and surgical specimens andcorrelated this value with outcome.RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of patients presented with luminal A-like tumors,45% had luminal B-like tumors, 14% had triple-negative BC, 5% had HER2-positiveBC, and 11% had triple-positive BC. Patients were predominantly diagnosed withstage III disease (52%) and high-grade tumors (46%). Median Ki67 level was 20%before NAC, which decreased to a median of 10% after NAC. Fifty-seven percent of patients had a decrease in Ki67 percentage. Ki67 decrease significantlycorrelated with better DFS and OS compared with no decrease, particularly in the luminal B subgroup. Multivariate analysis showed that nonreduction of Ki67significantly increased the hazard ratio of recurrence and death by 3.39 (95%confidence interval [CI] 1.8-6.37) and 7.03 (95% CI 2.6-18.7), respectively.CONCLUSION: Patients without a decrease in Ki67 in residual tumors after NAC havepoor prognosis. This warrants the introduction of new therapeutic strategies inthis setting.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study evaluates the change in Ki67 percentagebefore and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and its relationship withsurvival outcomes in patients with breast cancer who did not achieve completepathological response (pCR). These patients, a heterogeneous group with diverseprognoses that cannot be treated using a single algorithm, pose a challenge toclinicians. This study identified a subgroup of these patients with a poorprognosis, those with luminal B-like tumors without a Ki67 decrease after NAC,thus justifying the introduction of new therapeutic strategies for patients whoalready present a favorable prognosis (luminal B-like with Ki67 decrease).© AlphaMed Press 2018.DOI: 10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0396 PMCID: PMC6067932 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29490940
