[Epub ahead of print]Serum and urinary levels of CD222 in cancer: origin and diagnostic value.Vicikova K, Petrovcikova E, Manka P, Drach J, Stockinger H, Leksa V.The mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (CD222, M6P/IGF2R) is a multifunctional transmembrane type I receptor, mostly localizedintracellularly, less on the surface of all types of mammalian cells. It is knownboth to transport lysosomal enzymes through their mannose 6-phosphate moietiesand to internalize extracellular ligands like insulin-like growth factor 2 orplasminogen. CD222 is involved in regulation of cell proliferation, migration, T cell activation, and apoptosis. Soluble CD222 has been found in higherconcentrations in sera of liver disease patients. In this study, we analysed the level of CD222 present in body fluids, namely in serum and urine, of cancerpatients. We found significantly elevated levels of soluble CD222 in sera ofcancer patients compared to healthy controls irrespective of the type of disease.The urine CD222 levels were increased specifically in breast cancer and multiple myeloma. In contrast to serum, CD222 was present within CD222-positive exosomesin urine pointing to different origins of CD222 present in various human bodyfluids. Based on this work, we propose serum soluble CD222 as a general biomarkerfor tumorigenesis.DOI: 10.4149/neo_2018_171203N792 PMID: 29940770
