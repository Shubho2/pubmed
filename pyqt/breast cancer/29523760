Although the clinical outcome of breast cancerpatients has been considerably improved, the occurrence of resistance to commonendocrine and chemotherapy treatments remains the major cause of relapse andmortality. Thus, efforts in identifying new molecules to be employed in breastcancer therapy are needed. As a "faster" alternative to reach this aim, weevaluated whether lamotrigine, a broadly used anticonvulsant, could be"repurposed" as an antitumoral drug in breast cancer. Our data show thatlamotrigine inhibits the proliferation, the anchorage-dependent, and independent cell growth in breast cancer cells (BCC), including hormone-resistant cellmodels. These effects were associated with cell-cycle arrest and modulation ofrelated proteins (cyclin D1, cyclin E, p27Kip1, and p21Waf1/Cip1), all targetgenes of FoxO3a, an ubiquitous transcription factor negatively regulated by AKT. Lamotrigine also increases the expression of another FoxO3a target, PTEN, which, in turn, downregulates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, with consequentdephosphorylation, thus activation, of FoxO3a. Moreover, lamotrigine inducesFoxO3a expression by increasing its transcription through FoxO3a recruitment onspecific FHRE located on its own promoter, in an autoregulatory fashion. Finally,lamotrigine significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo, increasing FoxO3aexpression.Implications: The anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine shows strongantiproliferative activity on breast cancer, both in vitro and in vivo Thus, drugrepurposing could represent a valuable option for a molecularly targeted therapy in breast cancer patients.
