Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) revealed multiplebilateral pulmonary emboli. The patient was concurrently prescribed carbamazepineand was later diagnosed with recurrence of breast cancer during the admission. Wediscuss common drug interactions pertinent to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) that can increase the risk of further venous thromboembolism. This case reporthighlights the importance of reviewing patient medications when consideringanticoagulants and the need to raise awareness of these drug interactions amongclinicians when making their choice of anticoagulation. It also reinforces thecurrent lack of evidence for use of DOACs in patients with solid organmalignancies.Â© Royal College of Physicians 2018.
