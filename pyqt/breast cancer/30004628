The tumormicroenvironment contributes to tumor progression by inducing cell dissemination from the primary tumor and metastasis. TGFβ signaling is involved in breastcancer progression and is specifically elevated during metastatic transformation in aggressive breast cancer. In this study, we performed genomewide correlationanalysis of TGFBR2 expression in a panel of 51 breast cancer cell lines andidentified that MET is coregulated with TGFBR2. This correlation was confirmed atthe protein level in breast cancer cell lines and human tumor tissues. Flowcytometric analysis of luminal and basal-like breast cancer cell lines andexamination of 801 tumor specimens from a prospective cohort of breast cancerpatients using reverse phase protein arrays revealed that expression of TGFBR2and MET is increased in basal-like breast cancer cell lines, as well as intriple-negative breast cancer tumor tissues, compared to other subtypes. Usingreal-time cell analysis technology, we demonstrated that TGFβ1 triggeredhepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced and MET-dependent migration in vitro.Bioinformatic analysis predicted that TGFβ1 induces expression of C-ets-1 as acandidate transcription factor regulating MET expression. Indeed, TGFβ1-inducedexpression of ETS1 and breast cancer cell migration was blocked by knockdown ofETS1. Further, we identified that MET is a direct target of miR-128-3p and thatthis miRNA is negatively regulated by TGFβ1. Overexpression of miR-128-3p reducedMET expression and abrogated HGF-induced cell migration of invasive breast cancercells. In conclusion, we have identified that TGFβ1 regulates HGF-induced andMET-mediated cell migration, through positive regulation of C-ets-1 and negative regulation of miR-128-3p expression in basal-like breast cancer cell lines and intriple-negative breast cancer tissue.© 2018 The Authors.
