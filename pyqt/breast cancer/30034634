We have recently shown that human CDK18promotes efficient cellular responses to replication stress. In the currentstudy, we have investigated the clinicopathological and functional significanceof CDK18 expression levels in breast cancers.Results: High CDK18 protein expression was associated with a triple negative and basal-like phenotype (p = 0.021 and 0.027 respectively) as well as improvedpatient survival, which was particularly significant in ER negative breastcancers (n = 594, Log Rank 6.724, p = 0.01) and those treated with chemotherapy(n = 270, Log Rank 4.575, p = 0.03). In agreement with these clinical findings,breast cancer cells genetically manipulated using a dCRISPR approach to expresshigh levels of endogenous CDK18 exhibited an increased sensitivity to replicationstress-inducing chemotherapeutic agents, as a consequence to defectivereplication stress signalling at the molecular level.Conclusions: These data reveal that CDK18 protein levels may predict breastcancer disease progression and response to chemotherapy, and provide furtherrationale for potential targeting of CDK18 as part of novel anti-cancerstrategies for human cancers.Materials and Methods: CDK18 protein expression was evaluated in 1650 breastcancers and correlated to clinicopathological parameters and survival outcomes.Similar analyses were carried out for genetic and transcriptomic changes in CDK18within several publically available breast cancer cohorts. Additionally, we used a deactivated CRISPR/Cas9 approach (dCRISPR) to elucidate the molecularconsequences of heightened endogenous CDK18 expression within breast cancercells.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25686 PMCID: PMC6047673PMID: 30034634
