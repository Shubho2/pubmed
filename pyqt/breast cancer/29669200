Here, a three-way junction pocket DNA nanostructure wasdeveloped for efficient doxorubicin (Dox) delivery into cancer cells. Thethree-way junction pocket DNA nanostructure is composed of three strands ofAS1411 aptamer as both a therapeutic aptamer and nucleolin target, the potential biomarker of prostate (PC-3 cells) and breast (4T1 cells) cancers. The propertiesof the Dox-loaded three-way junction pocket DNA nanostructure were characterized and verified to have several advantages, including high serum stability and apH-responsive property. Cellular uptake studies showed that the Dox-loaded DNAnanostructure was preferably internalized into target cancer cells (PC-3 and 4T1 cells). MTT cell viability assay demonstrated that the Dox-loaded DNAnanostructure had significantly higher cytotoxicity for PC-3 and 4T1 cellscompared to that of nontarget cells (CHO cells, Chinese hamster ovary cell). The in vivo antitumor effect showed that the Dox-loaded DNA nanostructure was moreeffective in prohibition of the tumor growth compared to free Dox. These findingsshowed that the Dox-loaded three-way junction pocket DNA nanostructure couldsignificantly reduce the cytotoxic effects of Dox against nontarget cells.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00124 PMID: 29669200
