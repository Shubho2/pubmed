[Epub ahead of print]Association Between Estimated Mortality Risk and Measured Quality of Care inOlder Adults.Gotanda H(1)(2), Ganz DA(1)(3), Wenger NS(4).Author information: (1)Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs GreaterLos Angeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles, California.(2)Department of Health Policy and Management, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.(3)Division of Geriatrics, David Geffen School of Medicine, University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.(4)Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research, DavidGeffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles,California.Quality measures based on processes of care (e.g., breast cancer screening) arefrequently used to compare performance of providers and healthcare organizations in a value-based reimbursement system, but using these measures to makeperformance comparisons could penalize clinicians caring for older adults withmultiple comorbidities. These clinicians may more frequently withhold recommendedcare based on limited prognosis, patient preference, or potential adverse effectsand, as a result, may incur financial penalties because of poor measuredperformance. Alternatively, they may need to perform additional administrativework to exclude patients from quality measurement. To examine the potentialperformance handicap associated with caring for complex populations, wecross-sectionally examined the association between broad outpatient processes of care and 5-year mortality risk in a nationally representative older adult sample (≥ 65) from the 2002 to 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (n=26,006). Inadjusted analyses, performance score based on process-of-care measures wassignificantly worse in the high-risk group (5-year mortality risk ≥50; adjustedperformance score 67.4%; adjusted absolute difference 6.7%, 95% confidenceinterval (CI)=5.3-8.1%, p<.001) and in the intermediate-risk group (5-yearmortality risk 25-49%; adjusted performance score 71.7%; adjusted absolutedifference 2.4%, 95% CI=1.7-3.1%, p<.001) than in the low-risk group (5-yearmortality risk <25%); adjusted performance score 74.1% following <25%. The trend was overall constant across types of care processes and was more prominent in theyounger age brackets of our sample. These results suggest that use ofprocess-of-care measures can lead to disproportionate burden for clinicians andorganizations primarily taking care of complex populations.© 2018, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2018, The American GeriatricsSociety.DOI: 10.1111/jgs.15491 PMID: 30080251
