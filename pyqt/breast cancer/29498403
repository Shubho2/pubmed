We previously performed a phase II study foradvanced colorectal cancer (CRC) using five human leukocyteantigen (HLA-A*24:02)-restricted peptides derived from kinase of the outerchloroplast membrane 1, translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 34 (TOMM34), ring finger protein 43 (RNF43), vascular endothelial growth factorreceptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2. In the present study the relationship betweenoverall survival (OS) and several biomarkers, including cytotoxic Tlymphocyte (CTL) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to these five peptides, wasinvestigated. In 89 advanced CRC patients treated with a combination therapyconsisting of these five peptides and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, plasma was collected before and after 3 months of vaccine administration. IgGs reactive toeach of the five peptides were assessed using the multiplex bead suspensionLuminex system. Antigen-specific T-cell responses were estimated by enzyme-linkedimmunoSpot assay. Plasma levels of TOMM34 IgG (P<0.001), RNF43 IgG (P<0.001) and VEGFR2 IgG (P<0.001) were significantly increased after vaccination and stronger VEGFR2 IgG responses correlated significantly with OS in HLA-matchedpatients (P=0.034). CTL responses to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 were also significantlyincreased in the HLA-matched group (P=0.049 and P<0.001, respectively). However, increased CTL response did not correlate with OS. Multivariate analysis indicatedthat IgG responses to VEGFR2 were the most significant predictor for OS in theHLA-A*24:02-matched group (P=0.04). Our findings indicated that VEGFR2 IgGresponses may be an important immunological biomarker in the early course oftreatment for CRC patients treated with therapeutic epitope peptides.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6288 PMID: 29498403
