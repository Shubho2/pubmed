This study aimed to explore early RT-induced ECGchanges and to compare them with echocardiography changes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty eligible patients with chemotherapy-naïve left-sidedand 20 with right-sided breast cancer were evaluated with echocardiography, bloodsamples and ECG before and after RT.RESULTS: RT-induced ECG changes in the anterior leads. T-Wave changes were mostfrequent. T-Wave decline was associated independently with patient age (β=-0.245,p=0.005), mean heart radiation dose (β=1.252, p=0.001) and global systolic strainrate change (β=7.943, p=0.002). T-Wave inversion was associated independentlywith mean heart radiation dose (β=0.143, p<0.001), global longitudinal strainchange (β=0.053, p=0.017) and posterior calibrated integrated backscatter(β=-0.022, p=0.049).CONCLUSION: RT-induced ECG changes were prevalent and associated with functional and structural changes in echocardiography. ECG could be used for post-RT cardiacscreening.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12463 PMID: 29599341  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
