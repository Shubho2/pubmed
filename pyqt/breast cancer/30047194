To evaluate the effect in head andneck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), LINE-1 methylation levels and patterns havebeen measured both in vitro and in vivo.METHODS: Analysis of LINE-1 methylation in co-cultured models between HNSCC cell lines and normal PBMCs was performed. The observation of PBMCs of HNSCC patients compared to PBMCs of normal controls by using the Semi-Quantitative CombinedBisulfite Restriction Analysis technique.RESULTS: Down-regulation of LINE-1 methylation were significantly found in thePBMCs co-cultured with all HNSCC cell lines compared to normal PBMCs. Likewise, areduction of LINE-1 methylation levels was observed in PBMCs of HNSCC compared tonormal PBMCs (p < 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysisdemonstrated the potential of the unmethylated alleles (u Cu C) of LINE-1 fordistinguishing the PBMCs of HNSCC patients from normal controls with 100%sensitivity and specificity.CONCLUSION: Our data supported that the alteration of LINE-1 methylation levelsin PBMCs was influenced by HNSCC secretions. Moreover, the unmethylated LINE-1allele of PBMCs was proved to be an effective tumor marker and possess apotential as HNSCC diagnostic tool. This article is protected by copyright.
