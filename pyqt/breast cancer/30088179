This study aims to chronologically evaluate the survival of patients with breast cancer andinvestigate the observed changes over time.METHODS: Statistics from the Korean National Cancer Registry, based on all 60,571patients with invasive breast cancer during the 21 year period, were analyzed. Wedivided the study interval into four periods (P1: 1988-1992, P2: 1993-1997, P3:1998-2002, P4: 2003-2008).RESULTS: The patients treated during P4 showed significantly better 5-yearoverall survival (OS) than did those treated during P1 (5Y OS; P1 = 79.0 vs.P4 = 92.2, p < 0.001). In the multivariate analyses, younger age, mastectomy,high stage, high tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, and hormone receptornegativity were poor prognostic factors. The multivariate analysis demonstratedthat diagnosis periods significantly and independently associated with OS in the overall group of patients. In our analysis of age-period-interaction models, the hazard ratio (HR) for death for patients who were under 35 years of age, comparedto those who were older, tended to decrease over time (HR of age < 35 vs.35 ~ 50; P1 = 0.739, p = 0.007; P2 = 0.744, p < 0.001; P3 = 0.886, p = 0.041;P4 = 0.983, p = 0.813). The survival rate of patients who underwent breastconserving surgery (BCS) has recently gotten better than that of mastectomy (HRof mastectomy vs. BCS; P1 = 0.957, p = 0.790; P2 = 0.542, p < 0.001; P3 = 0.543, p < 0.001; P4 = 0.425, p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The clinical factors related to the changes in breast cancersurvival have improved and increased patient OS over the past 20 years in Korea. In addition, we provided new insights into the effects of age and surgery methodson prognosis in each period.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4892-x PMID: 30088179
