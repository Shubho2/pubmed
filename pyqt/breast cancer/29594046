Hypersialylation, the overexpression of sialic acid, is known topromote tumor progression and to dampen antitumor responses by mechanisms thatalso involve sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs),inhibitory immune receptors. Here, we discuss the expression patterns of Siglecs and sialyltransferases (STs) in gynecologic cancers, including breast, ovarian,and uterine malignancies, based on evidence from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Thebalance between sialosides generated by specific STs within the tumormicroenvironment and Siglecs on leukocytes may play a decisive role for antitumorimmunity. An interdisciplinary effort is required to decipher the characteristicsand biological impact of the altered tumor sialome in gynecologic cancers and to exploit this knowledge to the clinical benefit of patients.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00068 PMCID: PMC5859025PMID: 29594046
