Fenghaizhong@sjtu.edu.cn.ABSTACT: Recent molecularly targeted approach gains advance in breast cancertreatment. However, the estimated 5-year survival rate has not met the desiredexpectation for improvement, especially for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here we report that the lncRNA PVT1 promotes KLF5/beta-cateninsignaling to drive TNBC tumorigenesis. PVT1 is upregulated in clinical TNBCtumors. Using genetic approaches targeting PVT1 in TNBC cells, we found that PVT1depletion inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and orthotopicxenograft tumor growth. Mechanistically, PVT1 binds with KLF5 and increases itsstability via BAP1, which upregulates beta-catenin signaling, resulting inenhanced TNBC tumorigenesis. PVT1, KLF5, and beta-catenin were also revealed tobe co-expressed in clinical TNBC samples. Our findings uncover a new singalingpathway to mediate TNBC, and provide PVT1 as a new target for improving treatmentof TNBC.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0310-4 PMID: 29760406
