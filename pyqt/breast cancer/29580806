Naturalproducts extracted from herbs provide rich bioactive compounds with anticancerefficacy but may have limited or moderate potency and considerable toxicity. Wedeveloped a novel aziridonin, YD0514, by aziridinating oridonin, a naturalproduct of the medicinal herb Rabdosia rubescens. In this study, we found thatYD0514 significantly inhibited proliferation, motility, and adhesion ofmetastatic breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, GI101, GILM2, and GILM3. YD0514also decreased the protein expression of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2 and MMP9), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and integrin family members. Importantly,YD0514 suppressed the growth of metastatic breast cancer xenograft tumors andsignificantly inhibited lung metastasis in vivo. Lastly, we showed that YD0514's anti-metastatic effect on highly aggressive breast cancer is mediated viaregulating the NRF-2/RHOA/ROCK signaling pathway. These results demonstrate that YD0514, the first active analog based on an oridonin D-ring modification, has thepotential to be developed as an anti-metastasis therapy for patients withmetastatic cancers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
