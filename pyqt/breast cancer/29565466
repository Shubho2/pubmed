China.Circulating tumour cell (CTC) behaviours are distinct from those of bulk tissues.Thus, treatments to eliminate CTCs differ from the regimens followed to reducethe primary tumour and its metastases. Accordingly, comprehensively decipheringthe single nucleotide variant (SNV) profiles in CTCs, which partially determineCTC behaviours, is a priority. Using viable CTCs isolated with theoHSV1‑hTERT‑GFP virus coupled with fluorescence‑activated cell sorting (FACS),the whole genome was amplified using the multiple annealing and looping‑basedamplification cycle (MALBAC) method. CTC behaviours were evaluated using the SNVsfound to be recurrently mutated in different cells (termed CTC‑shared SNVs).Analysis of the sequencing data of 11 CTCs from 8 patients demonstrated that SNVsaccumulated sporadically among CTCs and their matched primary tumours(22 co‑occurring mutated genes were identified in the exomes of CTCs and theirmatched primary tissues and metastases), and 394 SNVs were shared by at least twoCTCs. Mutated APC and LRP1B genes co‑occurred in CTC‑shared and bulk‑tissue SNVs.Additionally, the breast‑originating identity of the CTC‑shared SNVs wasverified, and they demonstrated the following CTC behaviours: i) intravasationcompetency; ii) increased migration or motility; iii) enhanced cell‑cellinteractions; iv) variation in energy metabolism; v) an activated platelet orcoagulation system; and vi) dysfunctional mitosis. These results demonstratedthat it is feasible to capture and amplify the genomes of single CTCs using thedescribed pipeline. CTC‑shared SNVs are a potential signature for identifying theorigin of the primary tumour in a liquid biopsy. Furthermore, CTCs demonstratedsome behaviours that are unique from those of bulk tissues. Therefore, therapies to eradicate these precursors of metastasis may differ from the existingtraditional regimens.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6325 PMCID: PMC5928770PMID: 29565466
