The quantification ofthe contribution of the systematic source of variation is challenging in datasetscharacterized by hundreds of thousands of features.In this study, we introduce a method previously developed for the analysis of metabolomics data to evaluate theperformance of existing normalizing techniques to correct for unwanted variation.Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K was used to acquire methylation levels in over 421,000 CpG sites for 902 study participants of a case-control study onbreast cancer nested within the EPIC cohort. The principal component partialR-square (PC-PR2) analysis was used to identify and quantify the variabilityattributable to potential systematic sources of variation. Three correctingtechniques, namely ComBat, surrogate variables analysis (SVA) and a linearregression model to compute residuals were applied. The impact of each correctingmethod on the association between smoking status and DNA methylation levels wasevaluated, and results were compared with findings from a large meta-analysis.Results: A sizeable proportion of systematic variability due to variablesexpressing 'batch' and 'sample position' within 'chip' was identified, withvalues of the partial R2 statistics equal to 9.5 and 11.4% of total variation,respectively. After application of ComBat or the residuals' methods, thecontribution was 1.3 and 0.2%, respectively. The SVA technique resulted in areduced variability due to 'batch' (1.3%) and 'sample position' (0.6%), and in a diminished variability attributable to 'chip' within a batch (0.9%). After ComBator the residuals' corrections, a larger number of significant sites (k = 600 and k = 427, respectively) were associated to smoking status than the SVA correction (k = 96).Conclusions: The three correction methods removed systematic variation in DNAmethylation data, as assessed by the PC-PR2, which lent itself as a useful toolto explore variability in large dimension data. SVA produced more conservativefindings than ComBat in the association between smoking and DNA methylation.DOI: 10.1186/s13148-018-0471-6 PMCID: PMC5863487PMID: 29588806
