The main objectives of the study were to investigate theimmunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)family ligands (VEGF-A and VEGF-C) and receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3) inbreast cancer and their associations with clinicopathological parameters, cancer subtypes/subgroups and patient outcome. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumortissue samples were collected from early-stage breast cancer patients treatedwith anthracycline-based chemotherapy within a randomized trial.Immunohistochemistry was performed on serial 2.5 Î¼m thick tissue sections fromtissue microarray blocks. High VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 protein expression was observed in 11.8% (N = 87), 80.8% (N = 585), 28.1% (N = 202),64.6% (N = 359) and 71.8% (N = 517) of the cases, respectively. Significantassociations were observed among all proteins (all p-values <0.05), with theexception of the one between VEGF-C and VEGFR1 (chi-square test, p = 0.15).Tumors with high VEGF-A protein expression, as compared to tumors with lowexpression were more frequently ER/PgR-negative (33.3% vs. 20.8%, chi-squaretest, p = 0.009) and HER2-positive (44.8% vs. 20.6%, p<0.001). In addition,tumors with high VEGFR1 expression, were more frequently HER2-positive (32.8% vs.19.6%, p<0.001), while tumors with high VEGFR3 expression were more frequentlyER/PgR-negative (24.9% vs. 17.0%, p = 0.024) and HER2-positive (26.9% vs. 14.8%, p = 0.001). High VEGF-A and VEGF-C protein expression was associated withincreased DFS in the entire cohort (HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.92, Wald's p = 0.020and HR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96, p = 0.025, respectively), as well as in specificsubtypes/subgroups, such as HER2-positive (VEGF-A, HR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.74, p= 0.008) and triple-negative (VEGF-C, HR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.21-0.91, p = 0.027)patients. High vs. low VEGFR1 expression was an unfavorable factor for DFS intriple-negative patients (HR = 2.74, 95% CI 1.26-5.98, p = 0.011), whereas theopposite was observed among the ER/PgR-positive patients (HR = 0.69, 95% CI0.48-0.98, p = 0.041). Regarding OS, high VEGF-C protein expression wasassociated with increased OS in the entire cohort (HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.46-0.89,Wald's p = 0.008), as well as in in specific subtypes/subgroups, such asER/PgR-negative (HR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.71, p = 0.003) and triple-negative (HR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.90, p = 0.026) patients. In conclusion, high expression of angiogenesis-related proteins is associated with adverse clinicopathologicalparameters in early-stage breast cancer patients and may be surrogate markers of biologically distinct subgroups of ER/PgR-negative or triple-negative tumors withsuperior outcome. Further validation of our findings in independent cohorts isneeded.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200302 PMID: 30063723
