The pharmacokinetics and safety ofveliparib extended-release (ER) were evaluated in patients with advanced solidtumors. This phase I study assessed veliparib-ER up to 800 mg once daily or600 mg twice daily. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), recommended phase II dose(RP2D), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were assessed in cycle 1 andsafety/tolerability during continuous administration (28-day cycles). Seventy-onepatients (n = 53 ovarian, n = 17 breast, n = 1 prostate carcinoma) receivedveliparib; 50 had deleterious breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA) gene mutations.Single-dose veliparib-ER 200 mg (fasting) led to 58% lower peak concentration andsimilar area under the concentration-time curve compared with veliparibimmediate-release (IR). Three patients experienced DLTs (grade 2: asthenia; grade3: nausea/vomiting, seizure). RP2D and MTD for veliparib-ER were 400 mg BID. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were nausea (78.9%) and vomiting (50.7%). The most common grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs were as follows: thrombocytopenia(7.0%), nausea, and anemia (4.2% each). Overall, 12 (27.3%) patients with ovarianand 10 (62.5%) patients with breast carcinoma had a partial response.Veliparib-ER, versus veliparib-IR, exhibited an improved pharmacokinetic profile and was well tolerated in patients with ovarian and BRCA-mutated breast cancers.© 2018 The Authors.
