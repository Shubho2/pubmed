[Epub ahead of print]Pectoral nerve block as a single anesthetic technique for breast surgery andsentinel lymph node investigation.[Article in English, Spanish]Campos M(1), Azevedo J(2), Mendes L(2), Rebelo H(2).Author information: (1)Department of Anesthesiology, Centro Hospitalar de São João, Oporto, Portugal.Electronic address: martagcampos@hotmail.com.(2)Department of Anesthesiology, Centro Hospitalar de São João, Oporto, Portugal.Breast cancer surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia or, morerecently, combined with conventional regional techniques. Pectoral nerves (PECs) block appears as an analgesic alternative in these procedures, but few studiesrefer to it as a single anesthetic technique1-3. In this case report, we describea 56-year-old female patient, BMI 31kg/m2, ASA IV, admitted for electivetumorectomy of the left upper quadrant of the breast and sentinel nodeinvestigation. Given the multiple comorbidities and the high anesthetic andsurgical risk, the anaesthetic plan consisted in ultrasound guided PECs II block as a single anesthetic technique. The authors report a successful anesthetic and pain management without complications in breast surgery. PECs block, as a single anesthetic technique, may be safe, advantageous and effective with haemodynamicstability and few side effects in high risk cardiac patients.Copyright © 2018 Sociedad Española de Anestesiología, Reanimación y Terapéuticadel Dolor.
