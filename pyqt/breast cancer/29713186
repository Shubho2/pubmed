HDAC9 has been identified as an oncogene in human cancers. This study sought to assess the prognostic value and the biologic function of HDAC9 in breast cancerpatients.Methods: Expression of HDAC9 in breast cancer tissues and cells was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression assay were conducted to explore the prognostic significance ofHDAC9. Cell experiments were performed to investigate the effects of HDAC9 on thebiologic behaviors of breast cancer cells.Results: Expression of HDAC9 was significantly upregulated in both canceroustissues and cells compared with the normal controls (all P<0.05). Overexpression of HDAC9 was correlated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.021) and TNM stage(P=0.004). Patients with high HDAC9 had poor overall survival compared to thosewith low levels of HDAC9 (log-rank P<0.05). Elevated HDAC9 was found to be anindependent prognostic factor for the patients (hazard ratio=2.996, 95%CI=1.611-5.572, P=0.001). According to the cell experiments, tumor cellproliferation, migration and invasion were suppressed by knockdown of HDAC9.Conclusion: All data demonstrated that overexpression of HDAC9 serves as aprognostic biomarker and may be involved in the tumor progression of breastcancer.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S164583 PMCID: PMC5909784PMID: 29713186
