In a cross-sectional analysis of survivors, multivariable models wereused to test associations between participant characteristics and emergencycontraception use.SETTING: Not applicable.PATIENT(S): A total of 616 female cancer survivors aged 18-40.INTERVENTION(S): None.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Self-reported emergency contraception use.RESULT(S): The mean age of survivors was 33.4 ± 4.7, at a mean 7.5 years sincediagnosis. Breast cancer (22%), Hodgkin lymphoma (18%), and leukemia (8%) werethe most common cancers. Since diagnosis, 156 (25.3%) used emergencycontraception, 60% because of not otherwise using contraception. Age-adjustedprevalence of use was higher in survivors than in the general population (28.3%[95% confidence interval (CI) 24.7-31.9] vs. 12.0% [95% CI 11.1-12.9]). Inmultivariable analysis among survivors, nonwhite race (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.3,95% CI 1.0-1.8), breast cancer (PR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.0), partnered relationship(PR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.9), and older age (age 36-40 vs. 31-35; PR 0.7, 95% CI0.5-1.0) were associated with emergency contraception.CONCLUSION(S): Female young adult cancer survivors were significantly more likelyto use emergency contraception compared with the general population. Populations including nonwhite survivors have a higher risk, suggesting differences in familyplanning care. Strategies to improve contraception and decrease the need foremergency contraception are needed.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Published byElsevier Inc.
