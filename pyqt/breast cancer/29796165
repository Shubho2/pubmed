A greater understanding of themolecular characteristics of breast tumors could ultimately lead to improvedtumor-targeted treatment options, particularly for subsets of breast cancerpatients with unmet needs. Using an unbiased genomics approach to uncovermembrane-localized tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), we have identified glialcell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptor Î± 1 (GFRA1) as abreast cancer TAA. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that GFRA1 displays alimited normal tissue expression profile coupled with overexpression in specific breast cancer subsets. The cell surface localization as determined byfluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and the rapid internalization kineticsof GFRA1 makes it an ideal target for therapeutic exploitation as anantibody-drug conjugate (ADC). Here, we describe the development of apyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD)-armed, GFRA1-targeted ADC that demonstratescytotoxicity in GFRA1-positive cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX)models. The safety profile of the rat cross-reactive GFRA1-PBD was assessed in a rat toxicology study to find transient cellularity reductions in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, consistent with known off-target effects of PBD ADC's.These studies reveal no evidence of on-target toxicity and support furtherevaluation of GFRA1-PBD in GFRA1-positive tumors.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25160 PMCID: PMC5955426PMID: 29796165
