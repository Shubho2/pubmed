Epub 2018 Mar 13.Myricetin suppresses breast cancer metastasis through down-regulating theactivity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9.Ci Y(1), Zhang Y(1), Liu Y(2), Lu S(1), Cao J(1), Li H(1), Zhang J(1), HuangZ(1), Zhu X(2), Gao J(3), Han M(1).Author information: (1)Key Laboratory of Radiopharmaceuticals, Ministry of Education, College ofChemistry, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.(2)College of Life Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.(3)Department of Radiation Oncology, Anhui Province Hospital Affiliated to Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.Tumour metastasis is the major cause of breast cancer mortality. Myricetin, anatural polyphenol, is found in teas, wines, and berries. The pharmacodynamicaction and molecular mechanism of myricetin on breast cancer metastasis remainunknown. Here, we investigated the effect of myricetin on MDA-Mb-231Br cellviability, migration, invasion, and 4T1 mouse lung metastasis mouse models.MMP-2/9 protein expression and ST6GALNAC5 expression were analysed using western blot assays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively.Cell migration and invasion were detected by wound-healing and Boyden transwellassays. The antimetastatic effect in vivo was evaluated by lung metastasis model.Myricetin significantly decreased the activities of MMP-2/9 and mRNA levels ofST6GALNAC5. In addition, the migration, invasion, and adhesion were effectivelyinhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. On the other hand, mice treatedwith myricetin exhibited smaller tumour nodules compared with the vehicle mice,with only 17.78 ± 15.41% after treatment with 50 mg/kg myricetin. In conclusion, myricetin could significantly block invasion of MDA-Mb-231Br cells throughsuppressing the protein expression of MMP-2/9 and the expression of ST6GALNAC5,as well as lung metastasis in a mouse model, which suggests that myricetin shouldbe developed as a potential therapeutic candidate for breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/ptr.6071 PMID: 29532526
