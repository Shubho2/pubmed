Thereview is focused on the rehabilitative aspect of BCRL and undertaken accordingto the PRISMA statement with Levels of Evidence (LoE) assessed.RESULTS: 11 randomized controlled trials (9 with LoE 1a and 2 with LoE 1b) thatincluded 458 women with breast cancer in aftercare were included. The differenttypes of exercise consisted of aqua lymph training, swimming, resistanceexercise, yoga, aerobic, and gravity-resistive exercise. Four of the studiesmeasured a significant reduction in BCRL status based on arm volume and sevenstudies reported significant subjective improvements. No study showed adverseeffects of exercise on BCRL.CONCLUSION: The evidence indicates that exercise can improve subjective andobjective parameters in BCRL patients, with dynamic, moderate, and high-frequencyexercise appearing to provide the most positive effects.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4725-y PMID: 29470804
