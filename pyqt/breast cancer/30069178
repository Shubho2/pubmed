The biopsy of the metastaticsite had to be triple-negative, independent of the hormone receptor expression ofthe primary tumor. The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP). Secondary endpoints included assessment of safety and clinical benefit (objective response rate plus stable disease rate at â‰¥24 weeks).Results: 25 patients were included, and 22 were evaluable for both efficacy andtoxicities (median age, 66 years). Median TTP was 6.4 months (95% confidenceinterval 3.6-12.6). The most common grade 1-2 toxicities were nausea, diarrhea,leuko-/neutropenia, and reversible liver enzyme alteration. Grade 3 eventsincluded hand and foot syndrome (9%).Conclusion: The VEX regimen demonstrated activity and was relatively welltolerated when given as first-line therapy in selected metastatic breast cancerpatients with triple-negative disease.DOI: 10.1159/000487630 PMCID: PMC6062718 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 30069178
