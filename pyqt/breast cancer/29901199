Furthermore, the increasedexpression of FGF18 mRNA and protein has been associated with poor overallsurvival in cancer patients. However, its function has not been investigated inbreast cancer. In the present study, we demonstrated that FGF18 promoted cellgrowth and metastasis in vitro and stimulated tumor growth in xenograft modelsin vivo. FGF18 mediated the proliferation of MDA‑MB‑231 cells via the ERK/c‑Mycsignaling pathway and induced epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors to promote cancer migration and invasion. The decreased expression of FGF18 wasstrongly correlated with the loss/reduction of p‑ERK, c‑Myc, N‑cadherin, vimentinand Snail 1 protein in MDA‑MB‑231 cells. Collectively, our results indicated thatFGF18 played an important role in the growth and metastasis of breast cancer via the ERK/c‑Myc signaling pathway and EMT, indicating that FGF18 may be a potentialmolecular treatment target for breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6482 PMID: 29901199
