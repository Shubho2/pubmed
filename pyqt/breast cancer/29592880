However, despite these therapies, many tumorseventually develop resistance to these therapies. Our lab previously reported an unexpected sensitivity of HER2+ breast cancer cells to poly (ADP-ribose)polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), agents that target homologous recombination(HR)-deficient tumors, independent of a DNA repair deficiency. In this study, we investigated whether HER2+ trastuzumab-resistant (TR) breast cancer cells weresusceptible to PARPi and the mechanism behind PARPi induced cytotoxicity. Wedemonstrate that the PARPi ABT-888 (veliparib) decreased cell survival in vitroand tumor growth in vivo of HER2+ TR breast cancer cells. PARP-1 siRNA confirmed that cytotoxicity was due, in part, to PARP-1 inhibition. Furthermore, PARP-1silencing had variable effects on the expression of several NF-κB-regulatedgenes. In particular, silencing PARP-1 inhibited NF-κB activity and reduced p65binding at the IL8 promoter, which resulted in a decrease in IL8 mRNA and proteinexpression. Our results provide insight in the potential mechanism by which PARPiinduces cytotoxicity in HER2+ breast cancer cells and support the testing ofPARPi in patients with HER2+ breast cancer resistant to trastuzumab.
