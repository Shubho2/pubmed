We performed Cytokeratin 5/6 and CK8/18 immunohistochemistry on 150 casesof triple negative breast cancers and association with variousclinicopathological features was evaluated.RESULTS: Positive CK5/6 expression was noted in 8% (12 cases) of TNBC while 2.4% (4 cases) showed focal positive (<â€‰10%) and 89.3% (134) were negative with CK5/6.Complete loss of CK8/18 expression was seen in 4.7% (7 cases) while 32.7% (49cases) revealed focal loss of CK8/18 and 62.7% (94 cases) showed intact normalexpression of CK8/18. No significant association of CK5/6 and CK8/18 with variousclinicopathological parameters was observed. We found a low expression of basalcytokeratin (CK5/6) in TNBC our studied population, while loss/altered expressionof CK8/18 in approximately 38% of TNBC. Although no prognostic relevance of thesefinding was noted in our study, however these findings are different from thosereported in literature in other parts of the world. Therefore we suggest a morethrough immunohistochemical and genomic profiling of TNBC in our population forbetter understanding of this disease in this part of the world.DOI: 10.1186/s13104-018-3477-4 PMCID: PMC5994131PMID: 29884220
