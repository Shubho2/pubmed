Kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) aremicrotubule-dependent motor proteins that function as oncogenes in cancer cells, it has been discovered in recent years. Kinesin family member 2a (KIF2A), amember of the KIFs, has received attention for its role in carcinogenesis and itsprognostic value in several human cancers such as breast cancer, colorectalcancer, and squamous cell carcinoma. However, the role of KIF2A in human gastric cancer remains unknown. In this study we aimed to explore the expression andbiological functions of KIF2A in human gastric cancer cells, as well as to revealits potential action mechanism. First, we found that KIF2A was markedly increasedin gastric cancer cells (MKN-28, MKN-45, NCI-N87 and SGC-7901) compared to normalgastric mucosa epithelial cells (GES-1). Then KIF2A was successfully silenced in MKN-45 and SGC-7901 cells to facilitate further research into its function. Wediscovered that KIF2A silencing can significantly inhibit the growth and invasionof MKN-45 and SGC-7901 cells in a time-independent manner, accompanying adecreased expression of Membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). When MT1-MMP was reintroduced into MKN-45 and SGC-7901 cells in the KIF2A-siRNA group,only invasion inhibition effects on MKN-45 and SGC-7901 cells induced by KIF2Asilencing can be reversed. In conclusion, our study reveals that down-regulation of KIF2A can inhibit gastric cancer cell invasion by suppressing MT1-MMP.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/1440-1681.12974 PMID: 29781531
