The "seeds and soil"hypothesis suggested that bone marrow (soil) may provide a favorable "niche" for tumor cells (seed). When seeking for effective ways to prevent and treat tumorbone metastasis, most researchers focus on tumor cells (seed) but not the bonemarrow microenvironment (soil). In reality, only a fraction of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) could survive and colonize in bone. Thus, the bone marrowmicroenvironment could ultimately determine the fate of tumor cells that havemigrated to bone. Bone marrow adipocytes (BMAs) are abundant in the bone marrowmicroenvironment. Mounting evidence suggests that BMAs may play a dominant rolein bone metastasis. BMAs could directly provide energy for tumor cells, enhancethe tumor cell proliferation, and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.BMAs are also known for releasing some inflammatory factors and adipocytokines topromote or inhibit bone metastasis. In this review, we made a comprehensivesummary for the interaction between BMAs and bone metastasis. More importantly,we discussed the potentially promising methods for the prevention and treatmentof bone metastasis. Genetic disruption and pharmaceutical inhibition may beeffective in inhibiting the formation and pro-tumor functions of BMAs.DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00339 PMCID: PMC6036292PMID: 30013512
