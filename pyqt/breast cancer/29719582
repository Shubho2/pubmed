However, evidence from randomized trials islacking. The aim of this study was to analyze the results of platinum-basedchemotherapy for BRCA1-positive breast cancer in a neoadjuvant setting.Methods: A retrospective study was performed by obtaining information frompatient files. The results were compared with the available data from aliterature review.Results: Twelve female patients with BRCA1 gene mutations who had stage I to III breast cancers were eligible for evaluation. They received platinum-basedneoadjuvant chemotherapy between 2011 and 2016. Eleven patients received acombination of cisplatin and doxorubicin, and one patient received carboplatinand docetaxel. All patients underwent mastectomy after chemotherapy. Ten patients(83%) achieved pathological complete remission (pCR). The observed pCR rate wascomparable to existing results found in similar studies.Conclusion: The results of the study confirm the high pCR rate in BRCA1-positive breast cancer after platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Larger randomizedstudies and longer follow-up times are necessary to evaluate the role ofplatinum-based therapies in BRCA1-positive breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s13053-018-0092-2 PMCID: PMC5924493PMID: 29719582
