Electronic address:lin.wang@ibms.pumc.edu.cn.The unfolded protein response (UPR) is widely activated in cancers. The mammalianUPR encompasses three signaling branches, namely inositol-requiring enzyme-1α(IRE1α), protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) andactivating transcription factor 6α (ATF6α). The functional significance of eachbranch in tumorigenesis is incompletely understood, especially in cancer stemcells (CSCs). Here, we report that inhibition and silencing of the three UPRsensors has differential effects on breast cancer growth and the CSC population. The levels of PERK and ATF6α strongly correlate with the expression of sexdetermining region Y (SRY)-box 2 (SOX2), a pluripotency regulator, in humanbreast cancer tissues. UPR activation is also elevated in the CSC-enrichedmammospheres. Inhibition of the UPR sensors or excess ER stress markedly reduces the formation and maintenance of mammospheres, suggesting that an appropriatelevel of UPR activation is critical for the CSC survival. Mechanistically,transcription factors from UPR and pluripotency pathways interact andreciprocally influence each other. A transcription modulator,CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein delta (C/EBPδ), interacts with pluripotencyregulator, SOX2, and UPR transcription factors, thus likely serving as a link to coordinate UPR and pluripotency maintenance in CSCs. Our findings demonstratethat UPR is critical for both cancer growth and pluripotency, and highlight thedifferential role and complexity of the three UPR branches in tumorigenesis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
