Here, we evaluate the role of CGs and fundingsources in the development of guidelines for breast cancer therapies.Results: We identified 94 studies. CGs were involved in 28 (30%) studies whileindustry either partially or fully sponsored 64 (68%) studies. The number ofindustry funded studies increased over time (from 0% in 1976 to 100% in 2014; pfor trend = 0.048). Only 10 (11%) government or academic studies were identified.Studies conducted by GCs included a greater number of subjects (median 448 vs.284; p = 0.015), were more common in the neo/adjuvant setting (p < 0.0001), andwere more often randomized (p = 0.018) phase III (p < 0.0001) trials. Phase IIItrial remained significant predictor for CG-sponsored trials (OR 7.1 p = 0.004)in a multivariable analysis. Industry funding was associated with higherlikelihood of positive outcomes favoring the sponsored experimental arm (p =0.013) but this relationship was not seen for CG-sponsored trials (p = 0.53).Materials and Methods: ASCO, ESMO, and NCCN guidelines were searched to identify systemic anti-cancer therapies for early-stage and metastatic breast cancer.Trial characteristics and outcomes were collected. We identified sponsors and/or the funding source(s) and determined whether CGs, industry, or government oracademic institutions were involved. Chi-square tests were used for comparisonbetween studies.Conclusions: Industry funding is present in the majority of studies providing thebasis for which recommendations about treatment of breast cancer are made.Industry funding, but not CG-based funding, was associated with higher likelihoodof positive outcomes in clinical studies supporting guidelines for systemictherapy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24589 PMCID: PMC5871097PMID: 29599926
