Our work in human breast cancer cells identifies three classes of GBSswith distinct epigenetic characteristics and reveals that BRG1 interacts withGBSs prior to hormone exposure. The GBSs pre-occupied by BRG1 are more accessibleand transcriptionally active than other GBSs. BRG1 is required for a proper androbust transcriptional hormone response and knockdown of BRG1 blocks recruitment of the pioneer factors FOXA1 and GATA3 to GBSs. Finally, GR interaction withFOXA1 and GATA3 binding sites was restricted to sites pre-bound by BRG1. Thesefindings demonstrate that BRG1 establishes specialized chromatin environmentsthat define multiple classes of GBS. This in turn predicts that GR and othertranscriptional activators function via multiple distinct chromatin-basedmechanisms to modulate the transcriptional response.DOI: 10.7554/eLife.35073 PMCID: PMC5967868PMID: 29792595
