The cross-talk between cancer cells and interstitial cells exertssignificant effects on neoplasia and tumor development and is modulated in partby chemokines. CXC is one of four chemokine families involved in mediatingsurvival, angiogenesis, and immunosensitization by chemoattracting leukocytes,and it incentivizes tumor cell growth, invasion and metastasis in the tumormicroenvironment. However, the differential expression profiles and prognosticvalues of these chemokines remains to be elucidated.METHODS: In this study, we compared transcriptional CXC chemokines and survivaldata of patients with breast carcinoma (BC) using the ONCOMINE dataset,Kaplan-Meier Plotter, TCGA and cBioPortal.RESULTS: We discovered increased mRNA levels for CXCL8/10/11/16/17, whereas mRNA expression of CXCL1/2/3/4/5/6/7/12/14 was lower in BC patients compared tonon-tumor tissues. Kaplan-Meier plots revealed that high mRNA levels ofCXCL1/2/3/4/5/6/7/12/14 correlate with relapse-free survival (RFS) in all typesof BC patients. Conversely, high CXCL8/10/11 predicted worse RFS in BC patients. Significantly, high transcription levels of CXCL9/12/13/14 conferred an overallsurvival (OS) advantage in BC patients, while high levels of CXCL8 demonstratedshorter OS in all BC sufferers.CONCLUSIONS: Integrative bioinformatics analysis suggests that CXCL8/12/14 arepotential suitable targets for precision therapy in BC patients compared to otherCXC chemokines.Â© 2018 The Author(s).
