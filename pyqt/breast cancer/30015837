China.Currently, resistance to trastuzumab, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibitor, has become an important obstacle to improving the clinicaloutcome of patients with advanced HER2+ breast cancer. While cell behavior may bemodulated by long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs), the contributions of lncRNAs within extracellular vesicles (exosomes) are largely unknown. To this end, theinvolvement and regulatory functions of potential lncRNAs contained withinexosomes during the formation of chemoresistance in human breast cancer wereinvestigated. Trastuzumab-resistant cell lines were established by continuouslygrafting HER2+ SKBR-3 and BT474 cells into trastuzumab-containing culture medium.An lncRNA microarray assay followed by reverse transcription‑quantitativepolymerase chain reaction analysis identified that lncRNA-small nucleolar RNAhost gene 14 (SNHG14) was upregulated in trastuzumab-resistant cells whencompared with parental breast cancer cells. Functional experimentationdemonstrated that knockdown of lncRNA‑SNHG14 potently promotedtrastuzumab-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, extracellular lncRNA‑SNHG14 wasable to be incorporated into exosomes and transmitted to sensitive cells, thusdisseminating trastuzumab resistance. Treatment of sensitive cells with exosomes highly expressing lncRNA‑SNHG14 induced trastuzumab resistance, while knockdownof lncRNA‑SNHG14 abrogated this effect. The Signal Transduction Reporter Arrayindicated that lncRNA‑SNHG14 may promote the effect of trastuzumab by targetingthe apoptosis regulator Bcl‑2 (Bcl‑2)/apoptosis regulator BAX (Bax) signalingpathway. Furthermore, the expression level of serum exosomal lncRNA‑SNHG14 wasupregulated in patients who exhibited resistance to trastuzumab, compared withpatients exhibiting a response. Therefore, lncRNA‑SNHG14 may be a promisingtherapeutic target for patients with HER2+ breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4467 PMCID: PMC6065402PMID: 30015837
