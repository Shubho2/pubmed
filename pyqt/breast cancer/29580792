Our objective wasto explore mammographic diagnostic efficacy in a country where breast cancerscreening does not exist.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two mammographic test sets were used: a typical screening (TS) and high-difficulty (HD) test set. Nonscreening (NS) radiologists (n = 11)read both test sets, while 52 and 49 screening radiologists read the TS and HDtest sets, respectively. The screening radiologists were classified into twogroups: a less experienced (LE) group with ≤5 years' experience and a moreexperienced (ME) group with ≥5 years' experience. A Kruskal-Wallis andTukey-Kramer post hoc test were used to compare reading performance among reader groups, and the Wilcoxon matched pairs tests was used to compare TS and ND testsets for the NS radiologists.RESULTS: Across the three reader groups, there were significant differences incase sensitivity (χ2 [2] = 9.4, P = .008), specificity (χ2 [2] = 10.3, P = .006),location sensitivity (χ2 [2] = 19.8, P < .001), receiver operatingcharacteristics, area under the curve (χ2 [2] = 19.7, P < .001) and jack-knifefree-response receiver operating characteristics (JAFROCs) (χ2 [2] = 18.1,P < .001). NS performance for all measured scores was significantly lower thanthose for the ME readers (P < .006), while only location sensitivity was lower(χ2 [2] = 17.5, P = .026) for the NS compared to the LE group. No othersignificant differences were observed.CONCLUSION: Large variations in mammographic performance exist betweenradiologists from screening and nonscreening countries.Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.
