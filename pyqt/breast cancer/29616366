Radiation therapy is a mainstay option in thepostoperative setting for early breast cancer patients after breast-conservingsurgery. Nowadays, different options are available to de-escalate radiotherapy inthis scenario such as the use of hypofractionated whole-breast radiation, theselective delivery of the boost dose to the lumpectomy cavity, the introductionof accelerated partial breast irradiation and the omission of treatment inappropriately selected patients with low-risk features.
