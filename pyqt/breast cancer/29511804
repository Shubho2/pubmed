Phase-based MRelectric properties tomography was used to reconstruct conductivity. Mean ADC wasmeasured. Necrosis was defined as an area with very high T2 signal intensity. Therelationship between conductivity and ADC was examined using Spearman'scorrelation coefficient (r). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed toidentify factors associated with conductivity or ADC.RESULTS: In the total group, conductivity showed negative correlation with ADC (r= -0.357, p = 0.001). This correlation was maintained in the subgroup withoutnecrosis (n = 53, r = -0.455, p = 0.001), but not in the subgroup with necrosis(n = 28, r = -0.080, p = 0.687). The correlation between the two parameters wasdifferent according to necrosis (r = -0.455 vs -0.080, p = 0.047). HER2 enriched subtype was independently associated with conductivity (p = 0.029). Necrosis onMRI was independently associated with ADC (p = 0.027).CONCLUSIONS: Conductivity shows negative correlation with ADC that is abolishedby the presence of necrosis on MRI.KEY POINTS: • Electric conductivity showed negative correlation with ADC •However, the correlation was abolished by the presence of necrosis on MRI •HER2-enriched subtype was independently associated with conductivity • Necrosison MRI was independently associated with ADC.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-017-5291-0 PMID: 29511804
