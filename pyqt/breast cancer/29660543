This study assesses whether a scalp-coolingdevice is effective in reducing chemotherapy-induced alopecia, and assessesadverse treatment effects.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study including women withbreast cancer undergoing chemotherapy and scalp cooling using a Paxman device.The primary efficacy end points were: successful hair preservation (no hair loss;<30% hair loss not requiring a wig; or <50% hair loss not requiring a wig) at thecompletion of chemotherapy. Secondary end points included adverse effects such asheadache, pain, nausea or dizziness.RESULTS: The study enrolled 131 participants. Mean patient age was 49.8 years;74% received anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy and 26% receivedtaxane-monotherapy based chemotherapy. Hair preservation was successful in 102women who underwent scalp cooling (71.0%; 95% CI = 63-79%). Only adverse eventsrelated to device use were collected, representing 7% (95% CI = 3-11%) of cases.CONCLUSIONS: Scalp cooling is effective in preventing hair loss among breastcancer patients undergoing standard chemotherapy treatment, and has minimaladverse effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
