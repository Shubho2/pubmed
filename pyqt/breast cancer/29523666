Limited data have examined whether guideline adherence isrelated to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among Chinese patients withbreast cancer. Methods: An ongoing prospective cohort study involving 1,462Chinese women with early-stage breast cancer assessed exercise, diet, and bodymass index (BMI) at baseline and at 18-months follow-up after diagnosis. Eachassessment recorded patient habits within the previous 12 months. HRQoL wasevaluated by the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). We first compared the level of adherence to WCRF/AICR recommendations before andafter cancer diagnosis. We then examined whether adherence to theserecommendations after diagnosis was associated with HRQoL at 18 months. Results: The mean adherence score significantly increased from baseline (3.2; SD, 1.1) to 18-month follow-up (3.9; SD, 1.1; P<.001). Overall, increasing adherence to theWCRF/AICR guideline was associated with higher scores of global healthstatus/quality of life (QoL; Ptrend=.011), physical (Ptrend<.001) and rolefunctioning (Ptrend=.024), and lower scores for fatigue (Ptrend=.016), nausea andvomiting (Ptrend<.001), pain (Ptrend=.004), dyspnea (Ptrend=.030), loss ofappetite (Ptrend=.007), and diarrhea (Ptrend=.020). Patients with cancer who met the BMI recommendation had higher scores for physical functioning (P=.001) andlower scores for fatigue (P=.024), pain (P<.001), and dyspnea (P=.045). Adherenceto physical activity recommendation was associated with better scores of globalhealth status/QoL (P<.001), physical functioning (P=.003), fatigue (P=.002), pain(P=.018), and dyspnea (P=.021). Higher adherence to diet recommendation wasassociated with lower scores of nausea and vomiting (Ptrend=.005), loss ofappetite (Ptrend=.026), constipation (Ptrend=.040), and diarrhea (Ptrend=.031).Conclusions: Chinese patients with breast cancer made positive lifestyle changes early after cancer diagnosis. Increased adherence to WCRF/AICR recommendationsafter cancer diagnosis may improve HRQoL. Our data suggest that Chinese patients with breast cancer should follow the WCRF/AICR guideline to improve overallwell-being.Copyright Â© 2018 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.DOI: 10.6004/jnccn.2017.7202 PMID: 29523666
