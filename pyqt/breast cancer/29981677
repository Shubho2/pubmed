Flavonoids,among other compounds, are bioactive constituents of propolis. In thiscomparative study, we investigated the effects of flavonoids apigenin (API),genistein (GEN), hesperidin (HES), naringin (NAR) and quercetin (QUE) on theproliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle of two different human cancer cells -MDA-MB-231, estrogen-negative, and MCF-7, estrogen-positive receptor breastcarcinoma cells. Many cytotoxic reports of flavonoids were performed by MTTassay. However, it's reported that MTT is reduced in metabolically active cellsand yields an insoluble purple formazan, which indicates that obtained cytotoxic results of flavonoids could be inconsistent. Cell viability was measured by NR,neutral red assay, while the percentage of apoptotic cells and cell cycle arrest were determined by flow cytometry and Muse cell cycle assay, respectively. Theresults showed a high dose-dependent effect in cell viability tests. IC50 values were as follows (MCF-7/MDA-MB-231, for 48 h, in µM): 9.39/50.83 for HES,25.19/88.17 for API, 40.26/333.51 for NAR, 49.49/47.50 for GEN and 95.12/130.10for QUE. Flavonoid-induced apoptosis was dose- and time-dependent, for bothcancer cell lines, though flavonoids were more active on MCF-7 cells. Theflavonoids also induced cell cycle arrest in cancer cells.PMID: 29981677
