This study was designedto determine differences in stage at diagnosis of breast cancer among Koreanwomen according to screening history. The study population was derived from theKorea National Cancer Screening Program (KNCSP). The study cohort comprised17,689 women who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 and were invitedto undergo breast cancer screening via the KNCSP between 2002 and 2011. Ductalcarcinoma in situ (DCIS) and localized breast cancer were most frequent in bothever-screened and never-screened patients. Late stage cancer was significantlymore frequent in never-screened patients, compared with ever-screened patients.Compared to never-screened women, the odds ratio (OR) for being diagnosed withearly stage breast cancer among screened women was 1.41 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.28-1.55). The OR for being diagnosed with early stage breast cancer was highest among patients who underwent screening three times or more (aOR = 1.89,95% CI = 1.57-2.29). Screening by mammography was associated with diagnosis ofearly stage breast cancer in Korean women. However, significant increases in the diagnosis of DCIS and localized breast cancers among ever-screened patientssuggest the possibility of overdiagnosis due to screening.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27152-3 PMCID: PMC5995898PMID: 29892094
