[Epub ahead of print]Effect of OATP1B1/1B3 Inhibitor GDC-0810 on the Pharmacokinetics of Pravastatinand Coproporphyrin I/III in Healthy Female Subjects.Liu L(1), Cheeti S(1), Yoshida K(1), Choo E(2), Chen E(2), Chen B(2), Gates M(3),Singel S(3), Morley R(4), Ware J(1), Sahasranaman S(1).Author information: (1)Clinical Pharmacology, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.(2)Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA,USA.(3)Early Clinical Development, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.(4)Clinical Safety, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.Developed as an oral anticancer drug to treat estrogen receptor-positive breastcancer, GDC-0810 was shown to be a potent inhibitor of organic anion-transportingpolypeptide 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1/1B3) from an in vitro assay. A clinical studywas conducted to assess the drug-drug interaction potential between GDC-0810 and pravastatin, which is a relatively selective and sensitive OATP1B1/1B3 substrate.Fifteen healthy female subjects of non-childbearing potential were enrolled inthe study. On day 1 in period 1, a single 10-mg dose of pravastatin wasadministered to all subjects. Following a 4-day washout period, 600 mg ofGDC-0810 was administered once daily on days 5 through 8 in period 2 to achievesteady-state concentrations. On day 7, a single dose of 10-mg pravastatin wascoadministered with the 600-mg GDC-0810 dose. Concentrations of pravastatin(periods 1 and 2) and GDC-0810 (period 2 only) were quantified in blood samplesand subsequently used to calculate the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters. Thepravastatin mean maximal concentration and area under the curve values wereapproximately 20% and 41% higher, respectively, following pravastatincoadministration with GDC-0810 compared to pravastatin alone. Based on themagnitude of change in this drug-drug interaction study, dose adjustments forpravastatin (and other OATP1B1/1B3 substrates) were not considered necessary whenadministered with GDC-0810. Retrospectively, the endogenous biomarkers ofOATP1B1/1B3, coproporphyrin I and III, were also measured and showed changescomparable to those of pravastatin, indicating their utility in detecting weakinhibition of OATP1B1/1B3 in the clinical setting.Â© 2018, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.DOI: 10.1002/jcph.1261 PMID: 29786857
