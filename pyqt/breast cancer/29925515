[Epub ahead of print]Change in inflammatory biomarkers and adipose tissue in BRCA1/2+ breast cancersurvivors following a year-long lifestyle modification program.Sturgeon KM(1), Foo WY(2), Heroux ML(3), Schmitz K(4).Author information: (1)College of Medicine, Pennsylvania State University.(2)Department of Public Health Sciences, Penn State College of Medicine.(3)Research, Precision Nutrition.(4)College of Medicine, Pennsylvania State University kschmitz@phs.psu.edu.Breast cancer survivors who carry a genetic mutation for one of the BRCA genesoften undergo surgically-induced menopause a decade or more before the usual age of natural menopause. These women are at elevated risk for multiple negativehealth outcomes, including metabolic diseases, heart disease, and cancerrecurrence. Effects of a 12-month commercially available web-based lifestyleprogram (Precision Nutrition) were tested on body composition and markers ofinflammation in a randomized controlled trial. Participants (N=35) were BRCA1/2+,breast cancer survivors, and had completed surgically-induced menopause at age&lt;45 years. DXA was used to quantify body composition. Fasting blood sampleswere used to assay insulin, IL1β, IL6, IL8, and TNFα. At baseline, we observedrelationships between insulin, TNFα, and IL6, and between biomarkers andadiposity. Insulin and subcutaneous adipose tissue levels significantly decreasedfollowing the intervention compared to the change in the control group. Compared to baseline, TNFα and total adipose tissue levels decreased significantly in the intervention group. The percent change in insulin levels was moderatelycorrelated with the percent change in subcutaneous adipose tissue (r = 0.33).Change in adiposity was not related to change in TNFα or IL6. Women in theintervention group decreased levels of subcutaneous, but not visceral, adiposetissue. The change in subcutaneous adipose tissue was the main driver of changein insulin levels for the women in the intervention group. However, the change inbody composition achieved by the Precision Nutrition program was not sufficientto alter biomarker levels of inflammation.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-18-0098 PMID: 29925515
