To identify the genes and molecules associated with poorprognosis of early onset breast cancer, we examined gene expression profiles frompaired breast normal/tumor tissues, and coupled with Gene Ontology and publicdata base analysis. Our data showed that the expression of GAS7b gene was lowerin the early onset breast cancer patients as compared to the elder patients. Wefound that GAS7 was associated with CYFIP1 and WAVE2 complex to suppress breastcancer metastasis via blocking CYFIP1 and Rac1 protein interaction, actinpolymerization, and β1-integrin/FAK/Src signaling. We further demonstrated thatp53 directly regulated GAS7 gene expression, which was inversely correlated with p53 mutations in breast cancer specimens. Our study uncover a novel regulatorymechanism of p53 in early onset breast cancer progression throughGAS7-CYFIP1-mediated signaling pathways.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0253-9 PMCID: PMC6062498PMID: 29706651
