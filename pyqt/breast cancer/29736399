Elderly patients with associated diseases that modify their performance status do not toleratelong periods of daily irradiation. The objective of this study is to analyze the results of weekly hypofractionated treatment in these patients.Material and Methods: Between 1992 and 2016, we included 486 elderly patientspresenting concomitant pathology or sociofamilial problems in which it was notfeasible to propose conventional treatment. They were treated with conservativesurgery or mastectomy and then adjuvant hypofractionated irradiation,administering 5 Gy or 6.25 Gy in 6 fractions, once a week (total dose 30-37.5 Gy)over 6 weeks.Results: Breast cancer overall survival according to the Kaplan-Meier method at 5years was 74.2% ± 2.3%; breast cancer disease-free survival was 90% ± 1.6%; localrelapse-free survival was 96.5% ± 1% showing that patients die more from othercauses and not from their neoplasia. Acute dermatitis was mild (75.6% of thepatients grades I-III) and 30.6% had moderate chronic fibrosis.Conclusions: The once-weekly hypofractionated radiotherapy is a feasible andconvenient option for elderly patients with breast cancer. It is a safe treatmentmodality with similar survival and local control results compared to standardfractionation, while the side effects are acceptable.DOI: 10.1155/2018/8321871 PMCID: PMC5875042PMID: 29736399
