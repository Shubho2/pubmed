Combining positron emissiontomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) before-NST and the MARI (marking axillarylymph nodes with radioactive iodine seeds) procedure after neoadjuvant systemictherapy (NST) has the potential for avoiding unnecessary ALNDs. This reportpresents the results from implementation of this strategy.METHODS: All breast cancer patients treated with NST at the Netherlands CancerInstitute who underwent a PET/CT and the MARI procedure from July 2014 to July2017 were included in the study. All the patients underwent tailored axillarytreatment according to a protocol based on the combined results of PET/CT before NST and the MARI procedure after NST. With this protocol, patients showing one tothree FDG-avid axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) on PET/CT (cN<4) and a tumor-negative MARI node receive no further axillary treatment. All cN (<4) patients with atumor-positive MARI node receive locoregional radiotherapy, as well as patientswith four or more FDG-avid ALNs [cN(4+)] and a tumor-negative MARI node afterNST. An ALND is performed only for cN(4+) patients with a tumor-positive MARInode.RESULTS: The data of 159 patients who received a PET/CT before NST and a MARIprocedure after NST were analyzed. Of these patients, 110 had one to threeFDG-avid ALNs and 49 patients showed four or more FDG-avid ALNs on PET/CT before NST. For 130 patients (82%), ALND was omitted. Locoregional radiotherapy wasadministered to 91 patients (57%), and 39 patients (25%) received no furtheraxillary treatment.CONCLUSION: Combining pre-NST axillary staging with PET/CT and post-NST stagingwith the MARI procedure resulted in an 82% reduction of ALNDs for cN + breastcancer patients.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6404-y PMID: 29511992
