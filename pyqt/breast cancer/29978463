[Epub ahead of print]The prognostic value of tumor-stroma ratio in tumor-positive axillary lymph nodesof breast cancer patients.Vangangelt KMH(1), Tollenaar LSA(1), van Pelt GW(1), de Kruijf EM(1), DekkerTJA(1), Kuppen PJK(1), Tollenaar RAEM(1), Mesker WE(1).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, theNetherlands.The tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) has previously been found to be a strong prognostic parameter in primary breast cancer tumors. Since the presence of tumor cells inlymph nodes is important for clinical decision making, the influence of TSR inthe primary breast tumor combined with the TSR in tumor-positive lymph nodes onprognosis was evaluated. Women with invasive breast cancer without distantmetastasis who underwent an axillary lymph node dissection between 1985 and 1994 at the Leiden University Medical Center were retrospectively analyzed. TSRassessment was performed on hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue slides. Intotal, 87 (45.5%) primary tumors were scored as stroma-low and 104 (54.5%) asstroma-high. Patients with a high stromal percentage in the primary tumors had a statistically significant worse relapse free period (RFP) compared to stroma-low tumors (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.37-2.82, P < 0.001). A total number of 915 lymph nodes were assessed for TSR. In 101 (52.9%) patients, heterogeneity was observedbetween stroma percentage category in primary tumor and lymph nodes. Thecombination of TSR of the primary tumor combined with TSR of tumor-positive lymphnodes strengthened each other as independent prognostic parameter for RFP (P =0.019). Patients with primary tumor stroma-low/lymph nodes stroma-low tumorsshowed strongly improved RFP rates compared to patients with primary tumorstroma-high/lymph node stroma-high tumors with 10-year percentages of 58% versus 8%, respectively. Assessing the TSR on tumor-positive lymph nodes can provideadditional prognostic information. Stromal activation strongly differs betweenprimary tumors and lymph node metastasis.
