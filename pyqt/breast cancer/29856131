[Epub ahead of print]Highlights on molecular targets for radiosensitization of breast cancer cells:Current research status and prospects.Zhou ZR(1)(2), Yang ZZ(1)(2), Yu XL(1)(2), Guo XM(1)(2).Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center,Shanghai, China.(2)Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.In the past, searching for effective radiotherapy sensitization molecular targetsand improving the radiation sensitivity of malignant tumors was the hot topic forthe oncologists, but with little achievements. We will summarize the researchresults about breast cancer irradiation sensitization molecular targets over the past two decades; we mainly focus on the following aspects: DNA damage repair andradiation sensitization, cell cycle regulation and radiation sensitization, cell autophagy regulation and radiation sensitization, and radiation sensitivityprediction and breast cancer radiotherapy scheme making. And based on thissummary, we will put forward some of our viewpoints.Â© 2018 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/cam4.1588 PMCID: PMC6051209PMID: 29856131
