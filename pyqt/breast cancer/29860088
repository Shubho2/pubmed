Electronic address:chianhuilai@dragon.nchu.edu.tw.A label-free and ultrasensitive electrochemical impedance cytosensor wasdeveloped to specifically detect the breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 via theinteraction between the mannosyl glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and theoverexpressed mannose receptors on the target cell surface. The mannosyl GCE was prepared through electrografting of the amino-functionalized mannose derivatives on GCE surface in which a covalent bond was formed between carbon of theelectrode and the amino group of the mannose derivative. The fluorescentmicroscopy indicated that the electrode is specific for MDA-MB-231 cells, withgood biocompatibility for viable captured cells. The derivative with a shorteralkyl linker, mannose-C2NH2, showed a better sensitivity than that with a longer linker, mannose-C6NH2. GCE modified with amino-functionalized galactosederivative, galactose-C2NH2, shows no function to the detection of MDA-MB-231cells. The specific interaction between the mannosyl GCE and Con A (amannose-binding lectin) or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with overexpressedmannose receptors was determined through the change of peak separation in thecyclic voltammogram or the change of charge transfer resistance in theelectrochemical impedance spectra (Nyquist plot) in the electrolytes containing areversible redox couple [Fe(CN)6]3-/[Fe(CN)6]4-. The charge transfer resistancein the Nyquist plots linearly depended on the concentration of MDA-MB-231 cells(1.0 × 10-1.0 × 105 cells mL-1, with 10 cells mL-1 being the lower detectionlimit). Introducing 0.1% polyethylene glycol-200 (PEG-200) was able to preventthe interference caused by 1.0 × 103 HEK-293T cells mL-1, a non-cancer cell line (control).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
