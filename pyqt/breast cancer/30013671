Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.Overstimulation of pro-proliferative pathways and high level expression ofpro-proliferative transcription factors (TFs) can lead to apoptosis. This islikely due to TF binding sites for pro-proliferative TFs common topro-proliferative and pro-apoptosis-effector genes. Certain clinical datasetshave indicated that molecular markers associated with higher proliferation rates lead to improved outcomes for patients with cancer. These observations have been extensively assessed on a general basis, however there has been little workdissecting feed-forward apoptosis signaling pathways that may represent specific distinctions between a pro-proliferative mechanism and a pro-apoptotic mechanism in samples from patients with cancer. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets and bioinformatic approaches, the present study reports that higher FOS expressionlevels, along with higher FOS target apoptosis-effector gene expression, isassociated with an increased survival, while higher POU2F1 expression isassociated with a reduced survival (average difference of 25.9 months survival). In summary, in the datasets examined FOS represents an apoptosis-driver and high POU2F1 represents a driver mechanism for cancer development.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8957 PMCID: PMC6036554PMID: 30013671
