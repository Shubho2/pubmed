Geldanamycin (GA) was the firstidentified natural Hsp90 inhibitor, but hepatotoxicity has limited its clinicalapplication. Nevertheless, a new GA analog (WK-88- 1) with the non-benzoquinoneskeleton, obtained from genetically engineered Streptomyces hygroscopicus, wasfound to have anticancer activity against two human breast cancer cell lines.WK-88-1 produced concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation, cellcycle arrest, and apoptosis in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 andER-negative MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Detailed analysis showed that WK-88-1downregulated some key cell cycle molecules (CDK1 and cyclin B1) and lead to G₂/Mcell cycle arrest. Further studies also showed that WK-88-1 could induce humanbreast cancer cell apoptosis by downregulating Hsp90 client proteins (Akt, p-Akt,IKK, c-Raf, and Bcl-2), decreasing the ATP level, increasing reactive oxygenspecies production, and lowering the mitochondrial membrane potential. Meanwhile,we discovered that WK-88-1 significantly decreased the levels of Her-2 and ER-αin MCF-7 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, WK-88-1 significantlyincreased caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities and the cleavage of PARP in aconcentration-dependent manner (with the exception of caspase-3 and PARP in MCF-7cells). Taken together, our preliminary results suggest that WK-88-1 has thepotential to play a role in breast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.4014/jmb.1710.10063 PMID: 29618179
