Hence, a betterunderstanding of the cellular pathways underlying escape from cell death iscritical. Mitotic slippage describes the cellular process where cells exitanti-mitotic drug-enforced mitotic arrest and "slip" into interphase withoutproper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. The current report explores thecell fate consequence following mitotic slippage and assesses a major outcomefollowing treatment with many chemotherapies, therapy-induced senescence. It was found that cells post-slippage entered senescence and could impart thesenescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP factor production elicitedparacrine pro-tumorigenic effects, such as migration, invasion andvascularization. Both senescence and SASP factor development were found to bedependent on autophagy. Autophagy induction during mitotic slippage involved the autophagy activator AMPK and endoplasmic reticulum stress response protein PERK. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy or silencing of autophagy-related ATG5led to a bypass of G1 arrest-senescence, reduced SASP-associated paracrinetumorigenic effects, and increased DNA damage after S-phase entry with aconcomitant increase in apoptosis. Consistent with this, the autophagy inhibitor Chloroquine and microtubule-stabilizing drug Paclitaxel synergistically inhibitedtumor growth in mice. Sensitivity to this combinatorial treatment was dependenton p53 status, an important factor to consider before treatment.IMPLICATIONS:Clinical regimens targeting senescence and SASP could provide a potentialeffective combinatorial strategy with anti-mitotic drugs.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-0024 PMID: 30037855
