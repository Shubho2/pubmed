They were aged 60 to81 years (median 64 years). The distribution of disease was stage II in 10(13.3%), stage III in 33 (44.0%), and stage IV in 32 (42.7%). Among thesepatients, 59 cases received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Survival outcomes andtreatment toxicity were analyzed using IBM SPSS 19.0 software.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 13-78 months), theestimated 3-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), regional recurrence-free survival (RRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), progressionfailure-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were 95.6%, 95.5%,98.6%, 89.7%, and 89.2%, respectively. In the subgroup, 3-year OS rate in thepatients with concurrent chemotherapy was 90.5% and 77.4% in patients withoutconcurrent chemotherapy (Log-Rank = 1.795, P = .180). Univariate analysis showed that T stage and clinical stage were correlated with OS. Multivariate analysisindicated that age, T stage and tumor response at the end of treatment wereindependent prognosticators. Nine patients experienced grade 3 to 4 acutemucositis and 26 patients experienced grade 3-4 leukocytopenia, with no cases of skin rash and infusion reaction. Twelve patients developed mild liver functiondamage. No serious gastrointestinal or renal toxicities were observed.CONCLUSION: The efficacy of combined nimotuzumab with RT in elderly NPC patients was encouraging and the toxicities were accepted. In addition, nimotuzumabprovides a better option for elderly patients who cannot be toleratechemotherapy.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
