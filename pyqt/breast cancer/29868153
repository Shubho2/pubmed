Nigeria.(2)Surgery Department Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, Cape Coast, Ghana.(3)Radiology Department, University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin. Nigeria.Background: Tumour biology, physiologic features such as growth fraction andphysical features such as size may influence response of breast cancer toneoadjuvant chemotherapy. Molecular biology is an established basis forpredicting response and selecting neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Whether physicalcharacteristics such as size should influence chemotherapy regimen isinconclusive and has not been adequately studied in developing countries.Aim: To determine the relationship between breast tumour size and response toneoadjuvant chemotherapy and hence define the role of tumour size duringselection of neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced breast cancer.Method: Records of women managed at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital,Ilorin Nigeria, with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for locally advanced breastcancer were reviewed between January 2013 and June 2015. Data was analyzed as 2subgroups; primary tumour ≥100mm as group 1 and primary tumour ≥100mm as group 2.Primary outcome was 50% reduction in tumour size. Comparison was by chi-squaretest of independence at p value 0.05.Results: 57 records were reviewed (group1=24, group2=33). Majority (37( 65%))were premenopausal. Mean age was 47.9 ± 13.1 (range 28-85). NAC was either taxaneor anthracycline based regimen. Median chemotherapy dose was 4 (range 2-6).Widest diameter of tumours was 30mm to 180mm (mean 96 ±3.8mm, median 100mm). Meantumour diameter for groups 1 and 2 was 7.2 ±1.6mm and 12.2± 2.9mm respectively.50% reduction in tumour size was 45.8% and 6.0% for groups 1 and 2 respectively(p=0.0001).Conclusion: There was relationship between breast tumour size and response toneoadjuvant chemotherapy at a cut-off of 10mm. Well-designed prospective studies are required to confirm this relationship.DOI: 10.4314/mmj.v30i1.3 PMCID: PMC5974380PMID: 29868153
