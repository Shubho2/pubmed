EGFL7 plays a vital role in controllingvascular angiogenesis during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and maintainingskeletal homeostasis. It regulates cellular functions by mediating the mainsignaling pathways (Notch, integrin) and EGF receptor cascades. Accumulatingevidence suggests that Egfl7 plays a crucial role in cancer biology by modulatingtumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Dysregulation of Egfl7 has beenfrequently found in several types of cancers, such as malignant glioma,colorectal carcinoma, oral and oesophageal cancers, gastric cancer,hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer,osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, altered expression ofmiR-126, a microRNA associated with Egfl7, was found to play an important role inoncogenesis. More recently, our study has shown that EGFL7 is expressed in boththe osteoclast and osteoblast lineages and promotes endothelial cell activitiesvia extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and integrin signaling cascades, indicative of itsangiogenic regulation in the bone microenvironment. Thus, understanding the role of EGFL7 may provide novel insights into the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutic treatment for cancers and skeletal pathological disorders, suchas ischemic osteonecrosis and bone fracture healing.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcp.26792 PMID: 29923200
