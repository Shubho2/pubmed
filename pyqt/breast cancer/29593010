Epub 2018 Mar 28.Differences in Breast Cancer Survival by Molecular Subtypes in the United States.Howlader N(1), Cronin KA(2), Kurian AW(3), Andridge R(4).Author information: (1)Surveillance Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and PopulationSciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland. howladern@mail.nih.gov.(2)Surveillance Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and PopulationSciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.(3)Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.(4)The Ohio State University College of Public Health, Columbus, Ohio.Background: Although incidence rates of breast cancer molecular subtypes are welldocumented, effects of molecular subtypes on breast cancer-specific survivalusing the largest population coverage to date are unknown in the U.S.POPULATION: Methods: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry data,we assessed survival after breast cancer diagnosis among women diagnosed during2010 to 2013 and followed through December 31, 2014. Breast cancer molecularsubtypes defined by joint hormone receptor [HR, estrogen receptor (ER) and/orprogesterone receptor (PR)] and HER2 status were assessed. Multiple imputationwas used to fill in missing receptor status. Four-year breast cancer-specificsurvival per molecular subtypes and clinical/demographic factors were calculated.A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate survival while controlling for clinical and demographic factors.Results: The best survival pattern wasobserved among women with HR+/HER2- subtype (survival rate of 92.5% at 4 years), followed by HR+/HER2+ (90.3%), HR-/HER2+ (82.7%), and finally worst survival for triple-negative subtype (77.0%). Notably, failing to impute cases with missingreceptor status leads to overestimation of survival because those with missingreceptor status tend to have worse prognostic features. Survival differedsubstantially by stage at diagnosis. Among de novo stage IV disease, women withHR+/HER2+ subtype experienced better survival than those with HR+/HER2- subtype(45.5% vs. 35.9%), even after controlling for other factors.Conclusions:Divergence of survival curves in stage IV HR+/HER2+ versus HR+/HER2- subtype islikely attributable to major advances in HER2-targeted treatment.Impact: Contraryto conventional thought, HR+/HER2+ subtype experienced better survival thanHR+/HER2- in advanced-stage disease.
