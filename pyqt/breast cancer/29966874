The synthesized compounds were biologically evaluated fortheir cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. From2-aminopyridine and tyrphostin AG17 series, compounds 14, 16 and 20 showed thebest activities with IC50 values of 20.4, 18.3 and 26.3 µM, respectively comparedto E7070 IC50 36.3 µM. Further biological evaluation of 14, 16 and 20 againstcyclin dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) revealed good inhibitory activity with IC50 of2.53, 1.79 and 2.92 µM, respectively compared to roscovitine IC50 0.43 µM.Additionally, capability of γ-radiation to augment the cytotoxic activity of 14, 16 and 20 was studied and showed a dramatic increase in the cell killing effectat lower concentrations after irradiation. Docking was used to investigate thepossible binding modes of compounds 14, 16 and 20 inside the active site of CDK2 enzyme.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
