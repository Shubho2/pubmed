This study aimed to investigate the role of H4R in antitumourimmunity in a model of triple-negative breast cancer.METHODS: We evaluated growth parameters, histological characteristics and thecomposition of tumour, splenic and tumour draining lymph node (TDLN) immunesubsets, in a syngeneic model, developed orthotopically with 4T1 cells in H4Rknockout (H4R-KO) and wild-type mice.RESULTS: Mice lacking H4R show reduced tumour size and weight, decreased numberof lung metastases and percentage of CD4+ tumour-infiltrating T cells, whileexhibiting increased infiltration of NK cells and CD19+ lymphocytes. Likewise,TDLN of H4R-KO mice show decreased CD4+ T cells and T regulatory cells(CD4+CD25+FoxP3+), and increased percentages of NK cells. Finally, H4R-deficient mice show decreased Tregs in spleens and non-draining lymph nodes, and a negativecorrelation between tumour weight and the percentages of CD4+, CD19+ and NKsplenic cells, suggesting that H4R also regulates antitumour immunity at asystemic level.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that demonstrates the participation of H4R in antitumour immunity, suggesting that H4R could be a target for cancertreatment.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0173-z PMID: 29988113
