The aimof this work was to evaluate the promoter methylation status of the DACT2 gene inbreast cancer (BC) tissue and to analyze its possible effect on tumor type orgrade.METHODS: CpG island from the DACT2 promoter in region -240 to -14 fromtranscriptional start site (TSS) were obtained. Through the use of sodiumbisulfite DNA conversion analysis, followed by detection with MSP (methylationspecific PCR), we analyzed 79 BC and 15 adjacent healthy samples.RESULTS: T he c ases a nalyzed w ere i n s tage I ( 2.5%), I I (38%), or III(59.5%). The most frequent tumor type was invasive ductal carcinoma (71.4%).Methylation analysis comparing tumor tissues with adjacent non-cancerous tissues showed statistical significance. Methylation was observed in 32.9% (26/79) of thesamples; no methylation was found in adjacent healthy tissue. DACT2 methylationwas associated with tumor stage I-II (p=0.03) and stage III (p=0.004).CONCLUSION: An association was found of DACT2 promoter methylation with advanced tumor stages. This gene has been suggested as a potential biomarker, however,more investigation is required to validate this function.PMID: 29745077
