Because of the high consumption of time and money on carrying outbiological experiments, computational method which can help scientists choose themost likely associations between miRNAs and diseases for further experimentalstudies is desperately needed. In this study, we proposed a method of GraphRegression for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (GRMDA) which combines known miRNA-disease associations, miRNA functional similarity, disease semanticsimilarity, and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity. We used Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity to supplement the shortage of miRNAfunctional similarity and disease semantic similarity. Furthermore, the graphregression was synchronously performed in three latent spaces, includingassociation space, miRNA similarity space, and disease similarity space, by usingtwo matrix factorization approaches called Singular Value Decomposition andPartial Least-Squares to extract important related attributes and filter thenoise. In the leave-one-out cross validation and five-fold cross validation,GRMDA obtained the AUCs of 0.8272 and 0.8080 Â± 0.0024, respectively. Thus, itsperformance is better than some previous models. In the case study of Lymphomausing the recorded miRNA-disease associations in HMDD V2.0 database, 88% of top50 predicted miRNAs were verified by experimental literatures. In order to testthe performance of GRMDA on new diseases with no known related miRNAs, we tookBreast Neoplasms as an example by regarding all the known related miRNAs asunknown ones. We found that 100% of top 50 predicted miRNAs were verified.Moreover, 84% of top 50 predicted miRNAs in case study for Esophageal Neoplasmsbased on HMDD V1.0 were verified to have known associations. In conclusion, GRMDAis an effective and practical method for miRNA-disease association prediction.DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2018.00092 PMCID: PMC5826195PMID: 29515453
