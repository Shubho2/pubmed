Cancer hospital discharges were characterizedin 2012 according to the migratory status. The crude and specific rates ofhospital morbidity for this cause were estimated for the analysis of theirassociation with migratory status using zero-inflated negative binomialregression, adjusted for sociodemographic variables.RESULTS: The neoplasms were the third cause of hospital discharges for immigrantsand the seventh one for Chileans. The adjusted rate of cancer hospital dischargeswas higher for Chileans than immigrants, and the latter had fewer days ofhospitalization and greater proportion of surgical interventions. In the group ofimmigrants, cancer hospital discharges mainly corresponded to patients belonging to the private system (46%), and in the group of Chileans they mainlycorresponded to patients in the public system (71.1%). We observed a largedifference in the proportion of cancer hospital discharges for patients with nohealth insurance between the two populations (22.6%: immigrants, 1.0%: Chileans).In both populations, the three most frequent types of cancer were: (i) lymphoidtissue, hematopoietic organs, and related tissues, (ii) digestive organs, and(iii) breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Models of differentiated care should be considered for immigrants,with the creation of specific programs of information, coverage, and protectionagainst cancer. More information on this problem must be generated at the localand international level.DOI: 10.11606/S1518-8787.2018052000222 PMCID: PMC5893269PMID: 29641660  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
