Weaimed to investigate the differential diagnostic efficiency of PD-1 and otherimmune molecules and propose a panel of immune molecules combined with cancerantigen 15-3 (CA15-3) to distinguish breast cancer (BC) from benign breastdisease (BBD).Patients and methods: Ninety-one eligible BC patients and 31 BBD patients wereenrolled. Pretreatment peripheral blood was collected and tested for mRNAexpression of PD-1, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4, forkhead box P3,transforming growth factor beta, interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-2 receptor alpha(IL-2Rα), and cluster of differentiation 28 by quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR.Results: The diagnostic areas under curve (AUCs) of PD-1, IL-2Rα, and IL-10 forBC-BBD discrimination were 0.764, 0.758, and 0.743, respectively. The diagnostic efficiencies of these three parameters in distinguishing early-stage or advanced BC from BBD were consistent with a role in BC-BBD discrimination. A panel of PD-1+ IL-10 + IL-2Rα + CA15-3 showed the highest AUC (0.862), with a sensitivity of0.933 and a specificity of 0.724, for BC-BBD discrimination. In addition, forearly-stage BC discrimination, this panel also had the highest AUC (0.811), with a sensitivity of 0.933 and a specificity of 0.614, while for advanced BCdiscrimination, a panel of PD-1 + IL-10 + CA15-3 exhibited the highest AUC(0.896), with a sensitivity of 0.933 and a specificity of 0.783.Conclusion: These data indicate that the panel containing PD-1, IL-2Rα, IL-10,and CA15-3 can effectively discriminate BC from BBD with a high efficiency. Afterfurther confirmation, it could be used to complement conventional imagingmodalities, especially in discriminating early-stage BC from BBD.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S160452 PMCID: PMC6027692PMID: 29983594
