However, inhibitors of PI3K and AKT have failed to yield efficacious results without adverse effects. Here, we screened a librarycontaining 441 authenticated traditional chinese medicine (TCM) plant extracts byexamining their effect on cell viability of a human mammary epithelial cell line HMEC-PIK3CAH1047R, which expresses mutant PIK3CAH1047R and has constitutivelyactive AKT signaling. We found that Oridonin, an extract from Rabdosia rubescens,reduced cell viability to the greatest extent. Oridonin binds to AKT1 andpotentially functions as an ATP-competitive AKT inhibitor. Importantly, Oridonin selectively impaired tumor growth of human breast cancer cells withhyperactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling. Moreover, Oridonin prevented theinitiation of mouse mammary tumors driven by PIK3CAH1047R. Our results suggestthat Oridonin may serve as a potent and durable therapeutic agent for thetreatment of breast cancers with hyperactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24378 PMCID: PMC5963618PMID: 29844859
