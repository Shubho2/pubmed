[Epub ahead ofprint]Association of Low-Fat Dietary Pattern With Breast Cancer Overall Survival: ASecondary Analysis of the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Clinical Trial.Chlebowski RT(1), Aragaki AK(2), Anderson GL(2), Simon MS(3), Manson JE(4),Neuhouser ML(2), Pan K(5), Stefanic ML(6), Rohan TE(7), Lane D(8), Qi L(9),Snetselaar L(10), Prentice RL(2).Author information: (1)City of Hope National Medical Center, Department of Medical Oncology andTherapeutics Research, Duarte, California.(2)Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Division of Public Health Sciences,Seattle, Washington.(3)Wayne State University, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan.(4)Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.(5)Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center,Department of Medicine, Torrance, California.(6)Stanford Prevention Research Center, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.(7)Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College ofMedicine, Bronx, New York.(8)Stony Brook University, Preventive Medicine, Stony Brook, New York.(9)Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California at Davis.(10)College of Public Health, University of Iowa, Iowa City/Davenport.Importance: In a randomized clinical trial, a low-fat eating pattern wasassociated with lower risk of death after breast cancer. However, the extent towhich results were driven by dietary influence on survival after breast cancerdiagnosis was unknown.Objective: To determine the association of a low-fat dietary pattern with breast cancer overall survival (breast cancer followed by death from any cause measured from cancer diagnosis).Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a secondary analysis of the Women'sHealth Initiative randomized clinical trial that was conducted at 40 US clinical centers enrolling participants from 1993 through 1998. Participants were 48 835postmenopausal women with no previous breast cancer and dietary fat intake ofgreater than 32% by food frequency questionnaire.Interventions: Participants were randomized to a dietary intervention group (40%;n = 19 541) with goals to reduce fat intake to 20% of energy and increase fruit, vegetable, and grain intake or a usual-diet comparison group (60%; n = 29 294).Dietary group participants with incident breast cancers continued to participate in subsequent dietary intervention activities.Main Outcomes and Measures: Breast cancer overall survival for incident breastcancers diagnosed during the 8.5-year (median) dietary intervention, examined in post hoc analyses after 11.5 years (median) postdiagnosis follow-up.Results: Of 1764 women diagnosed with breast cancer during the dietaryintervention period, mean (SD) age at screening was 62.7 (6.7) years and age atdiagnosis was 67.6 (6.9) years. With 516 total deaths, breast cancer overallsurvival was significantly greater for women in the dietary intervention groupthan in the usual-diet comparison group (10-year survival of 82% and 78%,respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.94; P = .01). In thedietary group there were fewer deaths from breast cancer (68 vs 120; HR, 0.86;95% CI, 0.64-1.17), other cancers (36 vs 65; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.50-1.17), andcardiovascular disease (27 vs 64; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39-0.99).Conclusions and Relevance: In women who received a diagnosis of breast cancerduring the dietary intervention period, those in the dietary group had increased overall survival. The increase is due, in part, to better survival from severalcauses of death.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00000611.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.1212 PMID: 29800122
