Electronic address: hongzhy001@163.com.Rhizoma corydalis and Radix Angelicae Dahurica (Yuanhu-Baizhi) herbal medicinepair has been used for thousands of years and has been reported to be potentiallyactive in recent cancer therapy. But the exact active components or fractionsremain unclear. In this study, a new comprehensive two-dimensional (2D)3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)-decorated MCF7-cell membrane chromatography (CMC)/capcell-C18 column/time-of-flight mass spectrometry system was established for screening potential active components and clarifying the active fraction ofYuanhu-Baizhi pair. APTES was modified on the surface of silica, which canprovide an amino group to covalently link cell membrane fragments with the helpof glutaraldehyde in order to improve the stability and column life span of theMCF7 CMC column. The comprehensive 2D MCF7-CMC system showed good separation and identification abilities. Our screen results showed that the retention componentsare mainly from the alkaloids in Yuanhu (12 compounds) and the coumarins (10compounds) in Baizhi, revealing the active fractions of Yuanhu-Baizhi herbalmedicine pair. Oxoglaucine, protopine, berberine, osthole, isopimpinellin andpalmitic acid were selected as typical components to test the effects on cellproliferation and their IC50 were calculated as 38.17 μM, 29.45 μM, 45.42 μM,132.7 μM, 156.8 μM and 90.5 μM respectively. Cell apoptosis assay showed that thedrug efficacy was obtained mainly through inducing cell apoptosis. Furthermore, asynergistic assay results demonstrated that oxoglaucine (representative ofalkaloids from Yuanhu) and isopimpinellin (representative of coumarins fromBaizhi) showed significant synergistic efficacy with GFT, indicating that thesecomponents may act on other membrane receptors. The proposed 2D CMC system could also be equipped with other cells for further applications. Besides, thefollow-up in-vitro experimental strategy using cell proliferation assay, cellapoptosis assay and synergistic assay proved to be a practical way to confirm theactive fractions of herbal medicine.Copyright © 2017.
