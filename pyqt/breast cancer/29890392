However, thedetection of rare cells at single cell level requires a new class ofnanocomposite-coated electrodes with exceptional sensitivity and specificity. We recently developed a construct of gold nanoparticle-grafted functionalizedgraphene and nanostructured polyaniline (PANI) for high-performance biosensingwithin a very wide linear response and selective performance. Further, replacing the expensive gold nanoparticles with low-cost silver nanoparticles as well asoptimizing the nanocomposite synthesis and functionalization protocols on theelectrode surface in this work enabled us to develop ultrasensitivenanocomposites for label-free detection of breast cancer cells. The sensorpresented a fast response time of 30 min within a dynamic range of 10 - 5 × 106cells mL-1 and with a detection limit of 2 cells mL-1 for the detection of SK-BR3breast cancer cell. The nano-biosensor, for the first time, demonstrated a highefficiency of > 90% for the label-free detection of cancer cells in whole bloodsample without any need for sample preparation and cell staining. The resultsdemonstrated that the optimized nanocomposite developed in this work is apromising nanomaterial for electrochemical biosensing and with the potentialapplications in electro-catalysis and super-capacitances.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
