Tissue microarrays were constructed, and immunohistochemical staining was done to assess the Claudin3 expression andto classify breast cancers according to the immunohistochemical surrogates formolecular classification. Kaplan-Meier model and log-rank test were used forrecurrence-free survival and breast cancer-specific survival analysis.Results: Of the 853 patients, overall low expression of Claudin3 was seen in18.4%. Recurrence-free survival of patients with overall low Claudin3 breastcancers was poor in luminal A (P = .006) and luminal B (Her2-) (P = .009)subtypes compared with those who had Claudin3 expression in each group.Conclusions: Assessment of Claudin3 expression by immunohistochemistry issuggested for luminal A and luminal B (Her2-) subtypes to identify patients with poor prognosis.DOI: 10.1177/1178223417745858 PMCID: PMC5802694PMID: 29434471
