[Epub ahead of print]Previous History of Breast Cancer Increases Rates of Pulmonary Embolism and Costsafter Total Knee Arthroplasty: An Evaluation of 185,114 Matched Patients.Rosas S(1), Luo TD(1), Jinnah AH(1), Marquez-Lara A(1), Roche MW(2), Emory CL(1).Author information: (1)Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Wake Forest University School of Medicine,Winston-Salem, North Carolina.(2)Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Holy Cross Orthopedic Institute, FortLauderdale, Florida.Risk factors for adverse events after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) relating tomalignancy have not been well studied. Thus, the purpose of this study was toconduct a retrospective case-control outcome and cost analysis after TKA in this population. Patients with a history of breast cancer (BrCa) were identified basedon the International Classification of Disease 9th revision codes. An age- andsex-matched cohort was also identified of patients without a history of BrCa.Complications, length of stay, comorbidity burden, and reimbursements weretracked at 90 days. Each cohort comprised 92,557 patients. Length of stay wassimilar between cohorts (p = 0.627). Comorbidity status and incidence ofpulmonary embolism (PE), lower extremity ultrasound, and chest computedtomography (CT) use were higher in patients with a history of BrCa (p < 0.05 for all). Control patients had a lower incidence of acute myocardial infarction (0.14vs. 0.21%; p < 0.001). Surgical complications were similar. The 90-dayreimbursements were greater in patients with a history of BrCa (US$13,990 vs.US$13,033 for controls; p = 0.021). Surgeons should be aware of the increasedrisk of PE after TKA in patients with a history of BrCa as well as increased90-day costs, which warrant great attention.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.DOI: 10.1055/s-0038-1641155 PMID: 29618148
