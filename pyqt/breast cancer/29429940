In this clinical scenario, sentinel node mapping andbiopsy are gaining acceptance instead of axillary dissection to avoid morbidity. Biopsy proven positive lymph nodes must be reliably excised and examined afterNAC to further decrease the false negativity rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN)surgery. The standard method for axillary staging in breast cancer patients even after NAC is SLN biopsy (SLNB) with a radioisotope, blue dye, or both (dualtechnique). Currently, preoperative axillary staging with ultrasound and biopsy, along with placement of an image-detectable marker to be removed at the time ofdefinitive surgery is recommended. In this study, we evaluated some methods ofSLNB for patients treated with NAC like indocyanine green fluorescence,superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, indigocarmine blue dye,contrast-enhanced ultrasound using microbubbles, and tattooing. Some methods are also needed to ensure that the initially biopsy proven positive node is removedat the time of surgery to be carefully evaluated for residual disease afterchemotherapy like clip placement to the suspected or involved nodes before NAC,and removing the clipped node with the guidance of 125I-labeled radioactive seed or guide wires.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
