All MR images were retrospectively evaluated using a commerciallyavailable CAD system. The following kinetic parameters were prospectivelyrecorded for each lesion: initial peak enhancement, the proportion of early phasemedium and rapid enhancement, and the proportion of delayed phase persistent,plateau, and washout enhancement. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the association between the kinetic features assessed by CAD anddisease-free survival (DFS). The peak signal intensity and kinetic enhancementprofiles were compared with the clinical-pathological variables.RESULTS: There were 32 recurrences during a mean follow-up time of 55.2 months(range, 5-72 months). Multivariate analysis revealed that a higher peakenhancement (DFS hazard ratio, 1.004 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.001,1.006]; P = .013) on DCE MR imaging and a triple-negative subtype (DFS hazardratio, 21.060 [95% CI: 2.675, 165.780]; P = .004) were associated with a poorerDFS. Higher peak enhancement was significantly associated with a higher tumorstage, clinical stage, and histologic grade.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with breast cancer who showed higher CAD-derived peakenhancement on breast MR imaging had worse DFS. Peak enhancement and volumetricanalysis of kinetic patterns were useful for predicting tumor aggressiveness.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0195756 PMCID: PMC5896992PMID: 29649266  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
