The fabrication processes ofelectrochemical biosensor were characterized by scanning electron microscopy(SEM), FT-IR and electrochemical methods. Some experimental conditions such asimmobilization time of probe DNA and MCH incubation time, time and temperature ofhybridization were optimized. The designed biosensor revealed a wide linear rangeof 1.0 × 10-16 - 1.0 × 10-8 mol L-1 and a low detection limit (3.3 × 10-17 molL-1) for detection of BRCA1 5382 mutation by EIS technique. The designedbiosensor revealed high selectivity for discrimination of the complementary (P1C)sequences from various non-complementary sequences of (P1nC1, P1nC2 and P1nC3).Also, the biosensor revealed a high reproducibility (RSD of 7.5% (n=4)) and high stability (92% of its initial response after 8 days). So, the fabricatedbiosensor has a suitable potential to be applied for detection of breast cancersequences in the initial stages of the cancer.DOI: 10.17344/acsi.2017.3667 PMID: 29993090
