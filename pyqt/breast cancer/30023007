In cancer, the critical balance between theloss of genomic stability in malignant cells and the DDR provides excitingtherapeutic opportunities. Drugs targeting DDR pathways taking advantage ofclinical synthetic lethality have already shown therapeutic benefit - forexample, the PARP inhibitor olaparib has shown benefit in BRCA-mutant ovarian andbreast cancer. Olaparib has also shown benefit in metastatic prostate cancer inDDR-defective patients, expanding the potential biomarker of response beyondBRCA. Other agents and combinations aiming to block the DDR while pushing damagedDNA through the cell cycle, including PARP, ATR, ATM, CHK and DNA-PK inhibitors, are in development. Emerging work is also uncovering how the DDR interactsintimately with the host immune response, including by activating the innateimmune response, further suggesting that clinical applications together withimmunotherapy may be beneficial. Here, we review recent considerations related tothe DDR from a clinical standpoint, providing a framework to address futuredirections and clinical opportunities.DOI: 10.1177/1758835918786658 PMCID: PMC6047242PMID: 30023007
