Electronic address:a.p.crowe@curtin.edu.au.AIMS: Many gastrointestinal cell lines including Caco-2, LS174T and RKO requirefoetal calf serum (FCS) in culture medium. However, when isolating secretedproduct from conditioned medium (CM), after cell exposure to a trigger, it isbetter to remove FCS in the culture medium for identification of secretedproducts of interest. However, it is unknown whether defined medium adverselyaffects active efflux protein expression and tight junction formation.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using different gastrointestinal cell lines chosen withdifferent levels of efflux transporter expression, fully defined components, suchas using transferrin, insulin, selenium and ethanolamine without FCS or with areduced percentage of FCS (2%) were tested as an optimal choice for cell growth. In addition to morphological characteristics, the expression of the ABC effluxtransporters, ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein [P-gp]), ABCC2 (multidrug resistanceassociated protein 2), ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein) and occludin was determined.KEY FINDINGS: The cells required a minimum of 2% FCS for expression oftransporters. Fully defined medium with no serum adversely affected theexpression of transporters, especially P-gp. An important characteristic ofCaco-2 cells is its ability to form tight junctions. Caco-2 did not form adequatetight junctions without 10% FCS added in the medium, as evidenced by low TEERvalues and reduced occluding immunohistochemistry.SIGNIFICANCE: FCS is required for efflux protein expression and tight junctiongeneration. Nevertheless, it is possible to use 5 fold less FCS which assistswith low molecular weight secretion isolation. Passage number also contributessignificantly to the presence of these transporters.Crown Copyright Â© 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.
