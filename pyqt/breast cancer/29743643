Yet is it undetermined whether the bacteria itself or thecommunication between the host and bacteria is responsible for the genomicchanges in the eukaryotic cell. Now, we have investigated the genomic andepigenetic consequences of co-culturing colorectal carcinoma cells with membrane vesicles from pathogenic bacteria Vibrio cholerae and non-pathogenic commensalbacteria Escherichia coli. Our study reveals that membrane vesicles frompathogenic and commensal bacteria have a global impact on the gene expression of colon-carcinoma cells. The changes in gene expression correlate positively withboth epigenetic changes and chromatin accessibility of promoters at transcriptionstart sites of genes induced by both types of membrane vesicles. Moreover, wehave demonstrated that membrane vesicles obtained only from V. cholerae inducedthe expression of genes associated with epithelial cell differentiation.Altogether, our study suggests that the observed genomic changes in host cellsmight be due to specific components of membrane vesicles and do not requirecommunication by direct contact with the bacteria.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25308-9 PMCID: PMC5943334PMID: 29743643
