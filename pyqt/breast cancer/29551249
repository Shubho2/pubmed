There is limitedinformation regarding the measurement properties of patient-reported outcomemeasures of upper extremity activity limitation in this population. This studyexamined the reliability and validity of the Upper Extremity Functional Index(UEFI) in patients after surgery for breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Measures of function, shoulder flexion range of motion, andpain were obtained for 53 women before and 2 weeks after surgery for breastcancer. To estimate UEFI test-retest reliability, a convenience sample of 20patients was assessed on a second occasion within 48 hours of their 2-weekpostsurgery assessment. Convergent and discriminant construct validation methods were applied by examining correlations between UEFI scores and change scores withthose of the shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) +4 items,shoulder flexion range, and pain.RESULTS: UEFI test-retest reliability was estimated to be 0.87 (95% confidenceinterval, 0.69, 0.94), and the standard error of measurement was 4.8 (95%confidence interval, 3.7, 7.1) scale points. The 90% confidence interval for agiven UEFI score was ±7.9 and minimal detectable change at 90% confidence (MDC90)was ±11.1 points. UEFI correlations with the QuickDASH (cross-sectional -0.79 andlongitudinal -0.62) were greater than with the FACT-B+4 and impairment measures.CONCLUSION: These results support and guide the use of the UEFI in patients afterbreast cancer surgery.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
