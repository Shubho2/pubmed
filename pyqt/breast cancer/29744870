The circadian clock is subject to environmental factors, particularly light exposure and food intake rhythms. However, the association between nutritional circadianbehaviours and cancer is not well understood. We investigated the longitudinalassociations between number of eating episodes, night-time fasting duration, timeof first and last eating episodes, as well as nutritional quality of last eating episode, respectively, with breast and prostate cancer risks, the two main cancerlocations in women and men respectively. This prospective study included 41,389day-working adults in the French NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-2016) who completed at least three 24 h dietary records during the first 2 years of follow-up.Multivariable Cox models were computed. 1,732 first primary incident cancer caseswere diagnosed during the follow-up, among which 428 breast and 179 prostatecancers. After adjustment for covariates including sleep duration, late eaters(last eating episode after 9:30 pm) had an increased risk of breast (Hazard ratio[HR] = 1.48 [1.02-2.17], p = 0.03) and prostate (HR = 2.20 [1.28-3.78],p = 0.004) cancers. However, no association was observed between cancer risk and number of eating episodes, night-time fasting duration, time of first eatingepisode or macronutrient composition of the last eating episode. This largecohort study suggests that circadian perturbations resulting from late time oflast food intake may be involved in carcinogenesis at different locations. Beyondnutritional quality of food intake, nutritional circadian regulation should befurther investigated in the context of cancer prevention.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31584 PMID: 29744870
