In the present study, we examinedthe effects of a biotinylated form of 15d‑PGJ2 (b‑15d‑PGJ2) on hormone-dependent MCF‑7 and triple‑negative MDA‑MB‑231 breast cancer cell lines. b‑15d‑PGJ2inhibited cell proliferation more efficiently than 15d‑PGJ2 or the syntheticPPARγ agonist, efatutazone. b‑15d‑PGJ2 was also more potent than itsnon-biotinylated counterpart in inducing apoptosis. We then analyzed themechanisms underlying this improved efficiency. It was found not to be the resultof biotin receptor-mediated increased incorporation, since free biotin in theculture medium did not decrease the anti-proliferative activity of b‑15d‑PGJ2 in competition assays. Of note, b‑15d‑PGJ2 displayed an improved PPARγ agonistactivity, as measured by transactivation experiments. Molecular docking analyses revealed a similar insertion of b‑15d‑PGJ2 and 15d‑PGJ2 into the ligand bindingdomain of PPARγ via a covalent bond with Cys285. Finally, PPARγ silencingmarkedly decreased the cleavage of the apoptotic markers, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP‑1) and caspase‑7, that usually occurs following b‑15d‑PGJ2treatment. Taken together, our data indicate that biotinylation enhances theanti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity of 15d‑PGJ2, and that this effectis partly mediated via a PPARγ-dependent pathway. These results may aid in thedevelopment of novel therapeutic strategies for breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4338 PMID: 29620161
