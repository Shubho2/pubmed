[Epub ahead of print]Structural insight into the antagonistic action of diarylheptanoid on humanestrogen receptor alpha.Geetha Rani Y(1), Lakshmi BS(1).Author information: (1)a Tissue Culture and Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Biotechnology,Centre for Food Technology , Anna University , Chennai 600025 , India.Estrogen receptor α (ER α) is an important therapeutic target in the regulationof ligand dependent signaling in breast cancer. The current study investigatesthe anti-estrogenic potential of the Diarylheptanoid, 5-hydroxy-7-(4-hydroxy-3methoxyphenyl)-1-phenyl-3-heptanone (DAH) in silico. Rigid Docking analysis ofDAH at the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ER α showed hydrogen bond interactions with Arg394 and Glu353 at the active site, similar to the positive controls4-Hydroxy Tamoxifen (4-OHT) and Fulvestrant (FUL). The protein and theprotein-DAH complexes were further analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations for a time scale of 50 ns using GROMACS. Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF)analysis showed large fluctuations at the N-terminal region of Helices (H) 3, 9and at the C-terminal region of H11, which could be involved in the antagonistic conformational change. Interestingly, H12 appeared to move away from the ligandbinding pocket and occupy the co-activator binding groove at the LBD of ER α.Secondary structure analysis of the protein upon binding of DAH and CUR showedstructural change from α-helix to Turn conformation at H4. We hypothesize thatthis structural change at H4, similar to the positive control, could hinder theactivity of AF-2 by blocking the binding of co-activator. These conformationalchanges in ER α indicate an anti-estrogenic and therapeutic potential of the DAH.DOI: 10.1080/07391102.2018.1453378 PMID: 29557271
