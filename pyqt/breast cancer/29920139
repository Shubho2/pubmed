Women are the fastest growing patient population using VAhealthcare services. Quantifying the types of cancers diagnosed among women inthe VA is a critical step toward identifying needed healthcare resources forwomen Veterans with cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained data from the VA Central Cancer Registry forcancers newly diagnosed in calendar year 2010. Our analysis was limited to women diagnosed with invasive cancers (e.g., stages I-IV) between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2010, in the VA healthcare system. We evaluated frequencydistributions of incident cancer diagnoses by primary anatomical site, race, and geographic region. For commonly occurring cancers, we reported distribution bystage.RESULTS: We identified 1,330 women diagnosed with invasive cancer in the VAhealthcare system in 2010. The most commonly diagnosed cancer among womenVeterans was breast (30%), followed by cancers of the respiratory (16%),gastrointestinal (12%), and gynecological systems (12%). The most commonlydiagnosed cancers were similar for white and minority women, except white womenwere significantly more likely to be diagnosed with respiratory cancers(p < 0.01) and minority women were significantly more likely to be diagnosed withgastrointestinal cancers (p = 0.03).CONCLUSIONS: Understanding cancer incidence among women Veterans is important forhealthcare resource planning. While cancer incidence among women using the VAhealthcare system is similar to U.S civilian women, the geographic dispersion andsmall incidence relative to male cancers raise challenges for high quality,well-coordinated cancer care within the VA.DOI: 10.1089/jwh.2018.6936 PMID: 29920139
