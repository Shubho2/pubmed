With new advances in the field of tumorbiology and immunology, the role of radiation in the metastatic setting isevolving to harness its immune-enhancing properties. Through the release of tumorantigens, tumor DNA, and cytokines into the tumor microenvironment, radiationaugments the antitumoral immune response to affect both the targeted lesion anddistant sites of metastatic disease. The use of immunotherapeutics to promoteantitumoral immunity has resulted in improved treatment responses in patientswith metastatic disease and the combination of radiation therapy andimmunotherapy has become an area of intense investigation. In this article, wewill review the emerging role of radiation in the treatment of metastatic diseaseand discuss the current state of the science and clinical trials investigatingthe combination of radiation and immunotherapy.DOI: 10.1155/2018/4786819 PMCID: PMC5976948PMID: 29862083
