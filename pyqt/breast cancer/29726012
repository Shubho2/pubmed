However,the associations between RAD50 germline mutations and the survival and risk ofbreast cancer have not been fully elucidated. Here, we aimed to investigate theclinical impact of RAD50 germline mutations in a large cohort of unselectedbreast cancer patients. In our study, RAD50 germline mutations were determinedusing next-generation sequencing in 7657 consecutive unselected breast cancerpatients without BRCA1/2 mutations. We also screened for RAD50 recurrentmutations (L719fs, K994fs, and H1269fs) in 5000 healthy controls using Sangersequencing. We found that 26 out of 7,657 (0.34%) patients had RAD50 pathogenicmutations, and 16 patients carried one of the three recurrent mutations (L719fs, n = 6 cases; K994fs, n = 5 cases; and H1269fs, n = 5 cases); the recurrentmutation rate was 0.21%. The frequency of the three recurrent mutations in the5,000 healthy controls was 0.18% (9/5,000). These mutations did not confer anincreased risk of breast cancer in the studied patients [odds ratios (OR), 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51-2.63; p = 0.72]. Nevertheless, multivariateanalysis revealed that RAD50 pathogenic mutations were an independentunfavourable predictor of recurrence-free survival (RFS) [adjusted hazard ratio(HR) 2.66; 95% CI, 1.18-5.98; p = 0.018] and disease-specific survival (DSS;adjusted HR 4.36; 95% CI, 1.58-12.03; p = 0.004) in the entire study cohort. Our study suggested that RAD50 germline mutations are not associated with anincreased risk of breast cancer, but patients with RAD50 germline mutations have unfavourable survival compared to patients without these mutations.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31579 PMID: 29726012
