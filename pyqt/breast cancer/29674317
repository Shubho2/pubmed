Accordingly, establishmentand maintenance of epithelial architecture are essential for both embryonicdevelopment and adult physiology. Here, using gene knockout and knockdowntechniques along with gene profiling, we show that extracellular signal-regulatedkinase 3 (ERK3), a poorly characterized atypical mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK), regulates the epithelial architecture in vertebrates. We found that inXenopus embryonic epidermal epithelia, ERK3 knockdown impairs adherens andtight-junction protein distribution, as well as tight-junction barrier function, resulting in epidermal breakdown. Moreover, in human epithelial breast cancercells, inhibition of ERK3 expression induced thickened epithelia with aberrantadherens and tight junctions. Results from microarray analyses suggested thattranscription factor AP-2α (TFAP2A), a transcriptional regulator important forepithelial gene expression, is involved in ERK3-dependent changes in geneexpression. Of note, TFAP2A knockdown phenocopied ERK3 knockdown in both Xenopus embryos and human cells, and ERK3 was required for full activation ofTFAP2A-dependent transcription. Our findings reveal that ERK3 regulatesepithelial architecture, possibly together with TFAP2A.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA117.000992 PMCID: PMC5986203 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29674317
