Whether STAT3 physically and/or functionally interacts with GLI1/tGLI1has not been explored. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed 47node-positive breast cancer specimens using immunohistochemical staining andfound that phosphorylated-STAT3 (Y705), GLI1, and tGLI1 are co-overexpressed inthe majority of triple-negative breast carcinomas (64%) and HER2-enriched (68%)breast carcinomas, and in lymph node metastases (65%). Using gene set enrichment analysis, we analyzed 710 breast tumors and found that STAT3 activation andGLI1/tGLI1 activation signatures are co-enriched in triple-negative subtypes ofbreast cancers and HER2-enriched subtypes of breast cancers, but not in luminalsubtypes of breast cancers. Patients with high levels of STAT3 and GLI1/tGLI1co-activation in their breast tumors had worse metastasis-free survival compared to those with low levels. Since these proteins co-overexpress in breast tumors,we examined whether they form complexes and observed that STAT3 interacted withboth GLI1 and tGLI1. We further found that the STAT3-GLI1 and STAT3-tGLI1complexes bind to both consensus GLI1-binding and STAT3-binding sites usingchromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, and that the co-overexpressionmarkedly activated a promoter controlled by GLI1-binding sites. To identify genesthat can be directly co-activated by STAT3 and GLI1/tGLI1, we analyzed threeChIP-seq datasets and identified 34 potential target genes. Following validationsusing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and survival analysis, weidentified three genes as novel transcriptional targets of STAT3 and GLI1/tGLI1, R-Ras2, Cep70, and UPF3A. Finally, we observed that co-overexpression of STAT3with GLI1/tGLI1 promoted the ability of breast cancer cells to form mammospheres and that STAT3 only cooperates with tGLI1 in immortalized mammary epithelialcells. In summary, our study identified novel physical and functional cooperationbetween two families of oncogenic transcription factors, and the interactioncontributes to aggressiveness of breast cancer cells and poor prognosis oftriple-negative breast cancers and HER2-enriched breast cancers.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0132-4 PMCID: PMC5948110 [Available on 2018-08-16]PMID: 29449694
