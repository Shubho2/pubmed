We aimed to study the prevalence and determinants of dissatisfactionwith cosmetic outcome after breast cancer surgery of Asian breast cancersurvivors, and its association with patient-reported anxiety, depression, andquality of life. In a hospital-based cross-sectional study, 384 breast cancersurvivors of at least 12 months after diagnosis completed questionnaires onsatisfaction with cosmetic appearance, quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-C30) andanxiety and depression (HADS). Cumulative logit models were used to examine theadjusted association between dissatisfaction with cosmetic appearance anddemographic and clinical characteristics. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to testfor associations between dissatisfaction with cosmetic appearance andpatient-reported outcomes. Overall, 20% of women reported to be (very)dissatisfied with cosmetic appearance. Survivors of Chinese ethnicity were morelikely dissatisfied with cosmetic appearance compared to Malay survivors (22% and14% respectively, adjusted OR = 2.4, 95%CI: 1.4-3.9). Women with DCIS (adjustedOR = 2.2, 95%CI: 1.3-3.7) or advanced stage disease (adjusted OR = 2.2, 95%CI:1.2-3.9) had a higher risk of being dissatisfied with their cosmetic appearance. Women treated with mastectomy were at a higher risk of dissatisfaction withcosmetic appearance (adjusted OR = 1.7, 95%CI: 1.1-2.5). Dissatisfaction withcosmetic appearance was associated with increased depression scores. In thisSouth-East Asian population, one in five breast cancer patients were (very)dissatisfied with the cosmetic outcome of treatment. Chinese women, women withlarger tumors and women treated with mastectomy were most likely to reportdissatisfaction with cosmetic appearance.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193099 PMCID: PMC5821366PMID: 29466412  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
