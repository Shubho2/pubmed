Here, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-FNA) and ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy (US-CNB) in axillarystaging was compared.METHODS: A comprehensive search was undertaken of all published studies comparingthe diagnostic accuracy of US-CNB and US-FNA of axillary lymph nodes in breastcancer. Studies were included if raw data were available on the diagnosticperformance of both US-FNA and US-CNB, and compared with final histology results.Relevant data were extracted from each study for systematic review. Meta-analysiswas performed using a random-effects model. The pooled sensitivity andspecificity of US-FNA and US-CNB were obtained using a bivariable model. Summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) graphs were created to confirm diagnosticaccuracy.RESULTS: Data on a total of 1353 patients from six studies met the inclusioncriteria and were included in the final analysis. US-CNB was superior to US-FNAin diagnosing axillary nodal metastases: sensitivity 88 (95 per cent c.i. 84 to91) versus 74 (70 to 78) per cent respectively. Both US-CNB and US-FNA had a highspecificity of 100 per cent. Reported complication rates were significantlyhigher for US-CNB compared with US-FNA (7·1 versus 1·3 per cent; P < 0·001).Conversely, the requirement for repeat diagnostic procedures was significantlygreater for US-FNA (4·0 versus 0·5 per cent; P < 0·001).CONCLUSION: US-CNB is a superior diagnostic technique to US-FNA for axillarystaging in breast cancer.© 2018 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/bjs.10920 PMID: 29972239
