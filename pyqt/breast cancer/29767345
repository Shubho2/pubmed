New treatment approaches have prolonged the time that people withMBC live, but their quality of life has received less attention. Consequently,the needs and concerns across financial, vocational, psychological, social, andphysical domains in MBC patients are poorly understood-particularly regarding thecollateral damage or longer-term, life-altering impacts of MBC and itstreatments. This study's aims were to characterize MBC-related collateral damage,identify groups most likely to experience collateral damage, and examine itsassociations with psychological health, illness management, and health behaviors.METHODS: Participants (N = 515) with MBC were recruited from Dr. Susan LoveResearch Foundation's Army of Women® and other advocacy organizations.Participants completed questionnaires of MBC-related collateral damage,depressive symptoms, anxiety, self-efficacy for managing oncologic treatmentsand physical symptoms, sleep, and physical activity.RESULTS: Eight domains of MBC-related collateral damage, as well as MBC-relatedbenefit finding, were reliably characterized. Concerns aboutmortality/uncertainty were most prominent. Participants also endorsed high levelsof benefit finding. Participants younger than 50 years, with limited financialresources, or with children under 18 at home reported the most collateral damage.Collateral damage was associated significantly with compromised psychologicalhealth, lower illness management efficacy, and poorer health behaviors, beyondsociodemographic and medical characteristics.CONCLUSIONS: Subgroups of MBC patients report long-term, life-alteringconsequences of MBC and its treatments, which relate to important healthoutcomes. Clinical implications and recommendations are discussed.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4823-x PMID: 29767345
