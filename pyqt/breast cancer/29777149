Recent studies have shown that gentle daily stretching for10 minutes can reduce local connective tissue inflammation and fibrosis. Because mechanical factors within the stroma can influence the tumor microenvironment, wehypothesized that stretching would reduce the growth of tumors implanted withinlocally stretched tissues and tested this hypothesis in a mouse orthotopic breastcancer model. Female FVB mice (N = 66) underwent bilateral injection of p53/PTEN double-null primary mouse mammary tumor cells into the third mammary fat pad.Mice were randomized to stretch vs. no stretch, and treated for 10 minutes once aday, for four weeks. Tumor volume at end-point was 52% smaller in the stretchgroup, compared to the no-stretch group (p < 0.001) in the absence of any othertreatment. Cytotoxic immune responses were activated and levels of SpecializedPro-Resolving Mediators were elevated in the stretch group. These results suggesta link between immune exhaustion, inflammation resolution and tumor growth.Stretching is a gentle, non-pharmacological intervention that could become animportant component of cancer treatment and prevention.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-26198-7 PMCID: PMC5959865PMID: 29777149
