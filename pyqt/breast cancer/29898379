The molecular mass of Cv-LAAO is 120 kDa in its nativeform and 60 kDa in its monomeric form. The optimum enzyme activity was achievedon l-Leucine as a substrate in 50 mM buffer pH 7.5 at 50 °C. The Cv-LAAOIactivity was significantly reduced by increasing the temperature over 40 °C, lost75% of its activity at 60 °C and inhibited completely at 80 °C. The Cv-LAAOIattains the highest substrate specificity towards L-Met. The results have alsoindicated that Mn2+ enhances the enzyme activity by 10%, while Cu2+, Hg2+, Ni2+, Co2+ have suppressive effects on the Cv-LAAOI activity. On the other hand, EDTAhas no significant effect on the enzyme activity. The kinetic parameters ofCv-LAAOI activity (Km, Kcat and Vmax) estimated on l-Leucine at pH 8 and 37 °Cwere found to be 2 mM, 12 S-1 and 16.7 μmol/min/ml, respectively. In addition,the results have shown that Cv-LAAOI exhibits a significant bactericidal activityagainst gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, particularly Staphylococcusaureus and Escherichia coli with MIC values of 20 μg/ml. Moreover, Cv-LAAOI hasexhibited a considerable cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cell line(MCF-7) with IC50 value 2.75 ± 0.38 μg/ml compared with different tumor celllines (liver HepG2, lung A549, colon HCT116 and prostate PC3). Furthermore,Cv-LAAOI has triggered antiproliferative activity via extensive H2O2 generationas indicated by the increase in H2O2 and TBARS levels accompanied by thedepletion in the catalase activity (CAT) in MCF-7 treated cells compared to theuntreated ones. Thus, these findings clearly indicate that Cv-LAAOI has aselective cytotoxic effect on breast cancer cell line, demonstrating a greatprospective for future use in cancer therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
