CTCs can be used as potential biomarkers for disease prognosis, early cancer diagnosis andpharmacodynamics. However, the extremely low abundance of CTCs limits theirclinical utility because of technical challenges such as the isolation andsubsequent detailed molecular and functional characterization of rare CTCs frompatient blood samples. Methods: In this study, we present a novel densitygradient centrifugation method employing biodegradable gelatin nanoparticlescoated on silicon beads for the isolation, release, and downstream analysis ofCTCs from colorectal and breast cancer patients. Results: Using clinicalpatient/spiked samples, we demonstrate that this method has significantCTC-capture efficiency (>80%) and purity (>85%), high CTC release efficiency(94%) and viability (92.5%). We also demonstrate the unparalleled robustness ofour method in downstream CTC analyses such as the detection of PIK3CA mutations. Conclusion: The efficiency and versatility of the multifunctional densitymicrobeads approach provides new opportunities for personalized cancerdiagnostics and treatments.DOI: 10.7150/thno.23531 PMCID: PMC5858171PMID: 29556345
