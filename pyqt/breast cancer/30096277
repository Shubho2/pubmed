Recent data demonstrate that when using zoledronic acid to reduce the risk of skeletal-related events in metastatic breast cancer,metastatic prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma, the dosing interval ofzoledronic acid may be extended from every 4 weeks to every 12 weeks. The ASCOguidelines on the role of bone-modifying agents in metastatic breast cancer andmultiple myeloma address zoledronic acid dosing intervals. Herein, we discuss hownew data on dosing of bone-modifying agents influence our clinical practice.DOI: 10.1200/JOP.18.00236 PMID: 30096277
