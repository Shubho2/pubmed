Electronic address:nnavin@mdanderson.org.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype that frequentlydevelops resistance to chemotherapy. An unresolved question is whether resistanceis caused by the selection of rare pre-existing clones or alternatively throughthe acquisition of new genomic aberrations. To investigate this question, weapplied single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing in addition to bulk exome sequencingto profile longitudinal samples from 20 TNBC patients during neoadjuvantchemotherapy (NAC). Deep-exome sequencing identified 10 patients in which NAC ledto clonal extinction and 10 patients in which clones persisted after treatment.In 8 patients, we performed a more detailed study using single-cell DNAsequencing to analyze 900 cells and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze 6,862cells. Our data showed that resistant genotypes were pre-existing and adaptively selected by NAC, while transcriptional profiles were acquired by reprogramming inresponse to chemotherapy in TNBC patients.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
