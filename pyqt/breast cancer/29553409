They caneither wear a prosthesis or have a breast reconstruction. Unfortunately, manywomen in the Gaza Strip are unaware of these options. The aim of this study wasto shed light on the awareness and sociocultural factors in women who underwentmastectomy before choosing between options.METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited patients who underwentmastectomy in the Gaza Strip. All participants completed a face-to-facequestionnaire between Aug 1, 2015, and April 30, 2016. Verbal consent wasobtained from all participants.FINDINGS: 173 women with a mean age 51 years (SD 10) were enrolled in this study.90 (52%) women had low income, and 36 (21%) women had a first-degree relativewith breast cancer. 133 (77%) women underwent radical mastectomy, and 29 (17%)women had breast-conserving surgery. 96 (55%) women had tried a breast prosthesisto gain confidence, and 72 (42%) women were unaware of the availability of breastreconstruction in the Gaza Strip. 161 (93%) women expressed a strong desire tohave breast reconstruction surgery, whereas 12 (7%) women expressed no interest. The preference for breast reconstruction surgery was justified as a way ofregaining positive attitudes from others (135 [84%] women), improving romance andsatisfying their husbands (116 [72%]), and regaining self-confidence (37 [23%]). Being unconcerned about the physical appearance was the most common explanationfor refusing breast reconstruction surgery (47 [29%] women), whereas 18 (11%)women had a fear of getting unsatisfactory results.INTERPRETATION: When opting for breast reconstruction surgery, patients appear tobe affected by prior knowledge, societal attitudes, body appearance, and romanticrelationships. The findings suggest that assessing women's desires, goals, andexpectations could help improve service delivery after mastectomy. Efforts shouldbe made to spread knowledge and awareness of breast reconstruction options forwomen having a mastectomy in the Gaza Strip.FUNDING: None.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
