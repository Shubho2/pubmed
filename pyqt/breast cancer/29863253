The present study examined the effects of Linc00152 on thebreast cancer progression and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression levels of relevant genes in tissues andcells were detected by quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. Cellviability, growth, invasion, and migration were measured by CCK-8, colonyformation, transwell invasion, and migration assays, respectively. Western blotwas used to detect the expression levels of proteins.RESULTS: The results showed that Linc00152 was highly expressed in the breastcancer tissues compared to their adjacent normal tissues, and Linc00152 was also up-regulated in the breast cancer cell lines compared to normal cell lines.Knock-down of Linc00152 by using siRNAs in breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231and MCF-7) significantly suppressed cell viability, cell growth, cell invasionand migration as measured by the CCK-8, colony formation, transwell invasion, andmigration assays. The qRT-PCR and Western blot results showed that knock-down of Linc00152 suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer celllines. In addition, CCK-8 assay showed that knock-down of Linc00152 in MCF-7/ADR cells reversed the chemo-resistance to doxorubicin.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested the oncogenic role of Linc00152 in the breast cancer progression. Understanding the role of Linc00152 in breast cancerprogression may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of breastcancer.PMID: 29863253
