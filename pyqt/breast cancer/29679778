In this context, it is mandatory to developthree-dimensional breast tumor models able to reproduce this heterogeneity andthe dynamic interaction occurring between tumor cells and microenvironment. Here we show a new breast cancer microtissue model (T-µTP) uniquely able to presentintra-tumor morphological heterogeneity in a dynamic and responsive endogenousmatrix. T-µTP consists of adenocarcinoma cells, endothelial cells and stromalfibroblasts. These three kinds of cells are totally embedded into an endogenousmatrix which is rich in collagen and hyaluronic acid and it is directly produced by human fibroblasts. In this highly physiologically relevant environment, tumor cells evolve in different cluster morphologies recapitulating tumorspatiotemporal heterogeneity. Moreover they activate the desmoplastic andvascular reaction with affected collagen content, assembly and organization andthe presence of aberrant capillary-like structures (CLS). Thus, T-µTP allows tooutline main crucial events involved in breast cancer progression into a singlemodel overcoming the limit of artificial extra cellular matrix surrogates. Westrongly believe that T-µTP is a suitable model for the study of breast cancerand for drug screening assays following key parameters of clinicalinterest.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Tumor and microenvironmental heterogeneitymakes very hurdle to find a way to study and treat breast cancer. Here we developan innovative 3D tumor microtissue model recapitulating in vitro tumorheterogeneity. Tumor microtissues are characterized by the activation of thestromal and vascular reaction too. We underline the importance to mimic differentmicroenvironmental tumor features in the same time and in a single tissue inorder to obtain a model of spatiotemporal tumor genesis and progression, suitablefor the study of tumor treatment and resistance.Copyright © 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.
