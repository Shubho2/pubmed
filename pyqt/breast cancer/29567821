Weattributed payments for each patient to a phase of care (i.e., initial,continuing, or end of life), based on time from diagnosis until death or end ofstudy interval. We summed payments for all claims attributable to the primarycancer diagnosis and analyzed the overall and phase-based costs and then bydiffering demographics, cancer stage, geographic region, and year of diagnosis.RESULTS: We identified 428,300 patients diagnosed with one of the 10malignancies. Annual payments were generally highest during the initial phase.Mean expenditures across cancers were $14,381 during the initial phase, $2,471for continuing, and $13,458 at end of life. Payments decreased with increasingage. Black patients had higher payments for four of five cancers withstatistically significant differences. Stage III cancers posed the greatestannual cost burden for four cancer types. Overall payments were stable acrossgeographic region and year.CONCLUSION: Considerable differences exist in expenditures across phases ofcancer care. By understanding the drivers of such payment variations acrosspatient and tumor characteristics, we can inform efforts to decrease payments andincrease quality, thereby reducing the burden of cancer care.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Considerable differences exist in expenditures across phases of cancer care. There are further differences by varying patientcharacteristics. Understanding the drivers of such payment variations acrosspatient and tumor characteristics can inform efforts to decrease costs andincrease quality, thereby reducing the burden of cancer care.Â© AlphaMed Press 2018.DOI: 10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0481 PMCID: PMC6058326 [Available on 2019-01-01]PMID: 29567821
