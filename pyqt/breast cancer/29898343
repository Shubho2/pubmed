The Quality of LifeQuestionnaire-C30 and the Quality of Life Questionnaire - Breast Cancer Moduleinstruments were applied at three moments of treatment (onset, 40-50 days, and85-95 days after initiation).RESULTS: Women's global health status was affected in both groups since the firstphase of chemotherapy (76.2 points in the private institution and 74.6 points in the public institution, considering 100 points = maximum health). In both groups there was worsening of quality of life over time, which was lower in women in theprivate institution (second phase = 75.0 and third phase = 74; p=0.47), compared to those in the public institution (second phase = 71.5 and third phase 69.1;p=0.02). Regarding the type of institution, the most committed functions were theemotional and social in the private, and physical and pain in the public.CONCLUSIONS: The global quality of life of women with breast cancer deteriorated as a result of chemotherapy in both institutions, and it was lower in thosereceiving private care. Nursing should consider the type of institutionresponsible for women's care in order to provide comprehensive care thatconsiders the functions affected at each phase of treatment.Copyright© by the Universidad de Antioquia.DOI: 10.17533/udea.iee.v36n1e04 PMID: 29898343
