However, the effect of lipoicacid on breast cancer metastasis remains unclear.MAIN METHODS: In the present study, we examined the effects of lipoic acid on themigration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 breast cancer cells.KEY FINDINGS: Our data showed that lipoic acid effectively inhibited the colonyforming ability of highly invasive MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells. Moreover, thenontoxic concentrations of lipoic acid significantly reduced the migration ofbreast cancer cells. Lipoic acid also inhibited the TGFβ-inducedangiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) expression and reduced the activity of matrixmetalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an enzyme involved in invasion and metastasis, inboth the cell lines. The inhibition of cell migration by lipoic acid isaccompanied by the downregulation of FAK, ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation, andinhibition of nuclear translocation of β-catenin.SIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrated that lipoic acid inhibited the migration and invasion of metastatic breast cancer cells at least in part through inhibitingERK1/2 and AKT signaling. Thus, our findings show that the inhibition of TGFβsignaling is a potential mechanism for the anti-invasive effects of lipoic acid.Copyright © 2018.
