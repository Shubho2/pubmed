The antecedents and consequences wereinvestigated by means of proxy indicators. The HL was measured using the 47-item HLS-EU questionnaire (HLS-EUQ47) and the Newest Vital Sign (NVS). The twomeasures stood in significant correlation to the outcomes of the sub-disciplineof the Euro Health Consumer Index (r = 0.790 for HLS-EUQ47; r = 0.789 for NVS).The HLS-EUQ47 also stood in correlation to the percentage of population withpost-secondary education (r = 0.810), the reading performance for 15-year-oldstudents (r = 0.905), the presence of a national screening program for breast (r = 0.732) or cervical cancer (r = 0.873). The NVS stood in correlation with theunemployment rate (r = &minus;0.778), the Gross Domestic Product (r = 0.719), theGini coefficient (r = &minus;0.743), the rank of the Euro Patient EmpowermentIndex (r = &minus;0.826), the expenditure on social protection (r = 0.814), theConsumer Empowerment Index (r = 0.898), the percentage of adults using theinternet for seeking health information (r = 0.759), the prevalence of overweightindividuals (r = &minus;0.843), the health expenditure (r = 0.766), as well asthe percentage of individuals using the internet for interacting with publicauthorities (r = 0.755). This study provides some preliminary considerationsregarding alternative means by which to study HL and proposes new methods forexperimentation. The methods and the results could offer a means by which therelationship between society and overall healthcare protection could bestrengthened.DOI: 10.3390/ijerph15040798 PMCID: PMC5923840PMID: 29671791
