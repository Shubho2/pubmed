Following PRISMA guidelines, electronic databases and grey literature were searched April 2018 to identifybreast cancer events in MtF transgender persons. Screening and data extractionwere independently performed in duplicate by two reviewers. Study quality wasassessed using a component-based system. Qualitative analysis was performed onstudy characteristics, patient demographics, breast cancer characteristics, andbreast cancer presentation and management. Eighteen articles met inclusioncriteria representing 22 breast cancer events. Median age at breast cancerdiagnosis was 51.5 years. The most common breast cancer type was adenocarcinomas (59.1%) and half of the breast cancers were hormone sensitive, with estrogenreceptor positive status in 10 of 19 tested and progesterone receptor positivestatus in 5 of 14 tested. The most common presentation was breast lump (n = 6,42.9%), two patients had palpable lymph nodes at presentation (14.3%), and sixpatients eventually developed metastases (42.9%). Seven patients had a recordedpositive breast cancer family history and one was BRCA2 positive. Breast cancers were treated with mastectomies (simple, modified radical, and radical), widelocal excision, lumpectomy, or were unclear. Four patients received hormonetherapy (23.5%), two received radiation (11.8%), and seven received chemotherapy (41.2%). Breast cancer is present in MtF patients and commonly presents at ayounger age with a palpable mass. Major gaps in the literature include lack oftransgender population data and long term follow-up. This work highlights theneed for screening recommendations.Crown Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejso.2018.06.035 PMID: 30087072
