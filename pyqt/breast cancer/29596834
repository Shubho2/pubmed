Electronic address: drwangshuisry@163.com.The development of novel anti-papillary thyroid carcinoma agents is urgent.AZD5153 is a novel and specific Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4)inhibitor. Here, we show that AZD5153 dose-dependently inhibited survival,proliferation and cell cycle progression in TPC-1 cells and primary human thyroidcarcinoma cells. Yet, it was non-cytotoxic to the primary thyroid epithelialcells. AZD5153 induced caspase-3/-9 and apoptosis activation in TPC-1 cells andprimary cancer cells. Its cytotoxicity in TPC-1 cells was significantlyattenuated with co-treatment of the caspase inhibitors. BRD4 expression waselevated in TPC-1 and primary human thyroid carcinoma cells, but was low in thethyroid epithelial cells. BRD4-regulated proteins, including c-Myc, Bcl-2 andcyclin D1, were significantly downregulated following AZD5153 treatment in TPC-1 and primary cancer cells. In vivo, oral administration of AZD5153 atwell-tolerated doses significantly inhibited TPC-1 xenograft growth in severecombined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. BRD4-dependent proteins, Myc, Bcl-2 andcyclin D1, were also downregulated in AZD5153-treated tumor tissues.Collectively, the results suggest that targeting BRD4 by AZD5153 inhibits humanthyroid carcinoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
