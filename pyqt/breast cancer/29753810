Electronic address: sadeghma@modares.ac.ir.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes an important histologicalsubtype of breast cancer with a highly metastatic phenotype. The aim of thecurrent study was to investigate the possible synergism between dendrosomalnanocurcumin (DNC) and exogenously delivered p53 in producing anticancer effects on a TNBC cell line. MTT assay was exploited to determine the viability ofMDA-MB-231 cells against DNC and measure the impact of p53 overexpresssion onDNC-related cytotoxicity. Annexin-V/PI staining followed by flow cytometry andwound healing assay were used to evaluate the effects of DNC and exogenous p53,alone and in combination, on apoptosis induction and migratory capacity ofMDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. Also, quantitative real-time PCR was applied toanalyze the transcript levels of EMT- and metastasis-associated genes. Cellviability measurements demonstrated that DNC suppresses the proliferation ofMDA-MB-231 cells in a time- and dose-dependent mode and exogenous p53 elevatesthe sensitivity of cells to DNC-mediated cytotoxic effects. Apoptosis and woundhealing assays indicated that combination treatment with DNC and exogenous p53leads to significantly increased apoptosis and decreased migration of breastcancer cells, compared with single treatment. The results of gene expressionanalysis highlighted the high potency of combination strategy to significantlyreduce the expression of ZEB1 and BMI1 transcript levels. Altogether, ourfindings reveal that DNC and exogenous p53 act in a synergistic manner to elicit anticancer effects on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Therefore, our combination approach might be considered as a promising strategy for the development of newtherapeutic modalities against breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
