However, fewstudies examine the prevalence of CAM and its' relation to the patients' QoLamong women with breast cancer.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 95 women with breast cancer at a tertiary hospital in Saudi Arabia. The outcome measure of interest was theQoL. The correlation was used to assess the association between CAM use and QoL. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the factors that affect the use of CAM. The data was analysed using Statistical Package for the SocialSciences (SPSS) version 24.0.Results: CAM use was reported by 81.1% of the study participants. The mostcommonly used CAM therapy was spiritual therapy 70.5%, followed by honey 36.8%,olive oil 24.2% and 23.2% herbal therapy. We found that those who were undergoingcancer treatment had a significantly higher percentage of CAM usage as comparedto those not undergoing cancer therapy (72.6% vs. 8.4%, P=0.008). With regards toQoL, there was a statistically significant difference between CAM users andnon-CAM users in global health status (73.2% vs. 64.8%, P = 0.049).Conclusions: CAM therapy was commonly used among women in our study sample which was correlated with higher overall global QoL. As CAM is widely used, health careproviders may need to discuss the use of CAM with breast cancer women and be upto date on the benefits and risk of CAM use through well-equipped trainingprograms and workshops.DOI: 10.1016/j.jsps.2017.12.020 PMCID: PMC5856939PMID: 29556133
