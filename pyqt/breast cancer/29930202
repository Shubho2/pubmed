Epub 2018Jun 21.A Ca2+-stimulated exosome release pathway in cancer cells is regulated byMunc13-4.Messenger SW(1), Woo SS(1), Sun Z(1), Martin TFJ(2).Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI.(2)Department of Biochemistry University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WItfmartin@wisc.edu.Cancer cells secrete copious amounts of exosomes, and elevated intracellular Ca2+is critical for tumor progression and metastasis, but the underlying cellularmechanisms are unknown. Munc13-4 is a Ca2+-dependent SNAP receptor- andRab-binding protein required for Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion. Here we showthat acute elevation of Ca2+ in cancer cells stimulated a fivefold increase inCD63+, CD9+, and ALIX+ exosome release that was eliminated by Munc13-4 knockdown and not restored by Ca2+ binding-deficient Munc13-4 mutants. Direct imaging ofCD63-pHluorin exosome release confirmed its Munc13-4 dependence. Depletion ofMunc13-4 in highly aggressive breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells reduced the size of CD63+ multivesicular bodies (MVBs), indicating a role for Munc13-4 in MVBmaturation. Munc13-4 used a Rab11-dependent trafficking pathway to generate MVBs competent for exosome release. Membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinasetrafficking to MVBs by a Rab11-dependent pathway was also Munc13-4 dependent, andMunc13-4 depletion reduced extracellular matrix degradation. These studiesidentify a novel Ca2+- and Munc13-4-dependent pathway that underlies increasedexosome release by cancer cells.Â© 2018 Messenger et al.DOI: 10.1083/jcb.201710132 PMCID: PMC6080937PMID: 29930202
