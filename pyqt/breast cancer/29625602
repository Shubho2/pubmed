Specific survival rates were analysedusing the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models.RESULTS: Among 1613 patients, 65.7% (n = 1059) participated in a screeningprogramme. The interval cancer rate was 17.1% (n = 181). Tumours in the IC group were diagnosed at a more advanced stage, i.e. with further regional lymph nodemetastasis or local spread, than those in the SP group (p < 0.001), but withsignificantly fewer metastases at diagnosis than in the NSP group (p < 0.001).ICs underwent more aggressive primary treatments than the two other groups, with 28% of radical mastectomy and 67% undergoing chemotherapy. The five-year survivalrate for IC group were 92.0% (95% CI, 89.9-94.0%).CONCLUSIONS: Interval cancers had more aggressive features than screen-detectedcancers but were diagnosed at a less advanced stage compared to non-screendetected cancers. Despite having cancers missed by the screening programme, womenwho participate in the screening process seem to benefit from early treatment.These results must be confirmed with long-term follow-up.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4319-4 PMCID: PMC5889614PMID: 29625602
