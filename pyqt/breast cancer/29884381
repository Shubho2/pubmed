TPC and TFC weresignificantly higher in M. decemfidum extract than M. malabathricum extract.During DPPH, FRAF and β-carotene bleaching assays, M. decemfidum extractexhibited greater antioxidant activity compared to M. malabathricum extract.Effect of M. malabathricum and M. decemfidum extracts on viability of MDA-MB-231 cell at concentrations 6.25-100 μg/mL were evaluated for 24, 48 and 72 h. After48 and 72 h treatment, M. malabathricum and M. decemfidum leaves extractsexhibited significant activity in inhibiting MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line with M. malabathricum extract being more cytotoxic. M. malabathricum and M. imbricatumserves as potential daily dietary source of natural phenolics and to improvechemotherapeutic effectiveness.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
