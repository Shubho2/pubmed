Austria.BACKGROUND: The approval of Taxol® in 1993 marked the great entrance ofterpenoids in the anti-cancer area and this drug is still highly important in thetreatment of refractory ovarian, breast and other cancers. Over decades, otherprominent natural terpenoids have become indispensable for the modernpharmacotherapy of breast cancer. However, given the rapid evolution of drugresistance, effective treatments for advanced breast cancers requiring cytotoxic chemotherapy represent a major unmet clinical need. Therefore, innovative agents effective in long-term chemotherapy are urgently needed.OBJECTIVE: This review examines recent advances/research about naturalterpenoids, and their mechanisms against female breast cancer over the periodcovering January 1st, 2012 to December 31st, 2016.RESULTS: Carcinogenesis constitutes a multistep process wherein each stage ischaracterized by distinct phenotypic changes. Numerous chemicals recorded in thisreview have been shown to significantly inhibit proliferation, migration,apoptosis resistance, tumor angiogenesis or metastasis in different breast cancercells/tumours in vitro and in vivo. Targeting simultaneously several or all theseaspects/steps of cancer progression could be an advantage. In line with this,phytochemicals such as thymoquinone (8), costunolide (46), tanshinone IIA (132), triptolide (136), cucurbitacin B (179), celastrol (226) and lycopene (238) hadcaught our attention.CONCLUSION: These compounds appear to be promising to overcome breast cancertreatment failure. However, despite the interesting activities additionalpreclinical investigations are needed in further breast cancer cell/tumor models in vitro and in vivo.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/0929867325666180214110932 PMID: 29446727
