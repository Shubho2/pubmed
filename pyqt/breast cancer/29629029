In the present study, the anti-cancer activity of a water-soluble extract of C. unshiu peel (WECU) in MDA-MB-231 human breastcarcinoma cells at the level of apoptosis induction was investigated.MATERIALS/METHODS: Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected using DAPI staining and flow cytometry analyses. Mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, caspase activity and Westernblotting were used to confirm the basis of apoptosis.RESULTS: The results indicated that WECU-induced apoptosis was related to theactivation of caspase-8, and -9, representative initiator caspases of extrinsicand intrinsic apoptosis pathways, respectively, and caspase-3 accompanied byproteolytic degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and down-regulation of theinhibitors of apoptosis protein family members. WECU also increased thepro-apoptotic BAX to anti-apoptotic BCL-2 ratio, loss of mitochondrial membranepotential and cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm. Furthermore,WECU provoked the generation of ROS, but the reduction of cell viability andinduction of apoptosis by WECU were prevented when ROS production was blocked by antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that WECU suppressed proliferation ofMDA-MB-231 cells by activating extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways in aROS-dependent manner.DOI: 10.4162/nrp.2018.12.2.129 PMCID: PMC5886964PMID: 29629029
