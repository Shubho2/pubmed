Radionuclidemolecular imaging of HER2 expression might permit stratification of patients for HER2-targeting therapies. In this study, we evaluated a new HER2-imaging probebased on the designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) 9_29. DARPin 9_29 waslabeled with iodine-125 by direct radioiodination and with [99mTc]Tc(CO)3 usingthe C-terminal hexahistidine tag. DARPin 9_29 preserved high specificity andaffinity of binding to HER2-expressing cells after labeling. Uptake of[125I]I-DARPin 9_29 and [99mTc]Tc(CO)3-DARPin 9_29 in HER2-positive SKOV-3xenografts in mice at 6 h after injection was 3.4 ± 0.7 %ID/g and 2.9 ± 0.7%ID/g, respectively. This was significantly (p < 0.00005) higher than the uptake of the same probes in HER2-negative Ramos lymphoma xenografts, 0.22 ± 0.09 %ID/g and 0.30 ± 0.05 %ID/g, respectively. Retention of [125I]I-DARPin 9_29 in thelung, liver, spleen, and kidneys was appreciably lower compared with[99mTc]Tc(CO)3-DARPin 9_29, which resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) highertumor-to-organ ratios. The biodistribution data were confirmed by SPECT/CTimaging. In conclusion, radioiodine is a preferable label for DARPin 9_29.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6930425 PMCID: PMC6011117PMID: 29977173
