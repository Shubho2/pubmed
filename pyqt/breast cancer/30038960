Important mediators of these interactions are thesmall, membrane-enclosed extracellular vesicles, in particular exosomes. Bothcancer cell and fibroblast-derived exosomes carry a set of regulatory molecules, including proteins and different species of RNA, which cooperatively supportmetastatic tumor spread. Here, we briefly overview potential links between cancerstem cells and the exosome-mediated fibroblast-enriched metastatic nicheformation to discuss their role in the promotion of tumor growth and metastaticexpansion in breast carcinoma models.DOI: 10.1038/s41523-018-0071-9 PMCID: PMC6048124PMID: 30038960
