An increasing number ofasymptomatic women are being diagnosed with this condition and there isuncertainty over the best treatment algorithm for this condition if treatment is to be considered at all. Different subtypes of DCIS show innate differences indevelopmental pathways and biological behavior. This is not only determined bypathological subtypes but there is increasing understanding of molecularbiomarkers related to DCIS progression. The ultimate management aim is toidentify a subgroup of patients in whom DCIS will not progress to invasivedisease such that they can avoid morbidity from surgical and adjuvant therapies. This has to be balanced by the potential risk of undertreatment of patients inwhom DCIS is likely to progress to invasive cancer and hence a reduced lifeexpectancy. Results of current ongoing prospective randomized trials assessingthe safety of omitting surgery for what is considered to be low risk DCIS areeagerly awaited for by patients and clinicians. However the definition of what isconsidered to be "low risk" DCIS is still to be ascertained.DOI: 10.23736/S0026-4733.18.07729-5 PMID: 29589680
