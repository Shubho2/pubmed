A follow-up study.Al-Rawi SA(1), Saleh BO, Al-Naqqash MA.Author information: (1)Ministry of Health, Baghdad, Iraq. E-mail. alrawi_safana@yahoo.com.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of serum anti müllerian hormone (AMH)pre-chemotherapy treatment levels in prediction of post-chemotherapy effect onthe ovarian reserve of women with breast cancer.METHODS: This cohort prospective study was carried out at the BiochemistryDepartment, College of Medicine, University of Baghdad and at the OncologyClinic, Oncology Teaching Hospital, Baghdad, Iraq. It included 58 women withregular menstrual cycle (25-45 years) who were  newly diagnosed with breastcancer. The women were classified into 3 groups: GI: 30 women with breast cancer before starting chemotherapy, GII: the same 30 women of GI who finished 4 cycles of anthracycline chemotherapy (course 1) and GIII: which involved another 28women who had finished both courses of chemotherapy, (course 1) and (course 2).RESULTS: The mean (±SEM) value of AMH levels was significantly decreased in GIIand GIII when compared with GI (for both, p less than 0.0005). However, there wasno significant difference in serum AMH levels between GII and GIII.CONCLUSION: The measurement of serum AMH may be a useful biochemical marker ofthe chemotherapy extent induced ovarian reserve damage and the incidence ofamenorrhea.DOI: 10.15537/smj.2018.7.21897 PMID: 29968900
