Epub 2018Apr 30.Abdominal Sarcoidosis Mimicking Peritoneal Carcinomatosis.Roh WS(1), Lee S(2), Park JH(3), Kang J(2).Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.(2)Department of Surgery, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University Collegeof Medicine, Seoul, Korea.(3)Department of Pathology, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University Collegeof Medicine, Seoul, Korea.We present a patient diagnosed with skin sarcoidosis, breast cancer, pulmonarytuberculosis, and peritoneal sarcoidosis with a past history of colorectalcancer. During stage work up for breast cancer, suspicious lesions on peritoneum were observed in imaging studies. Considering our patient's history and imagingfindings, we initially suspected peritoneal carcinomatosis. However, theperitoneal lesion was diagnosed as sarcoidosis in laparoscopic biopsy. This case demonstrates that abdominal sarcoidosis might be considered as a differentialdiagnosis when there is a lesion suspected of being peritoneal carcinomatosiswith nontypical clinical presentations.DOI: 10.3393/ac.2018.01.29 PMCID: PMC5951098PMID: 29742855
