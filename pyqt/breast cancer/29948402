An altered expression of these molecules has been found indifferent tumorigenic processes of breast cancer, the most common type of cancer in the female population worldwide.PURPOSE: The objective of this review is to discuss how miRNAs become masterregulators in breast tumorigenesis.METHODS: An integrative review of miRNAs and breast cancer literature from thelast 5 years was done on PubMed. We summarize recent works showing that thedefects on the biogenesis of miRNAs are associated with different breast cancercharacteristics. Then, we show several examples that demonstrate the link betweencellular processes regulated by miRNAs and the hallmarks of breast cancer.Finally, we examine the complexity in the regulation of these molecules as theyare modulated by other non-coding RNAs and the clinical applications of miRNAs asthey could serve as good diagnostic and classification tools.CONCLUSION: The information presented in this review is important to encouragenew directed studies that consider microRNAs as a good tool to improve thediagnostic and treatment alternatives in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4850-7 PMID: 29948402
