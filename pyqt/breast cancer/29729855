These newer screening modalities purport improved cancerdetection over mammography alone but are not offered at all screening facilities and often require a larger co-pay or out-of-pocket expense. Thus, the potentialfor worsening disparities with regard to access and appropriate utilization ofsupplemental screening technologies exists. Currently, there is a dearth ofliterature on the topic of health disparities related to access and the use ofsupplemental breast cancer screening and their impact on outcomes. Identifyingand addressing explanatory factors for persistent and potentially worseningdisparities remain a central focus of efforts to improve equity in breast cancer care. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of factors that may contributeto present and future disparities in breast cancer screening and outcomes, andexplores specific relevant topics requiring greater research efforts as morepersonalized, multimodality breast cancer screening approaches are adopted intoclinical practice.Copyright Â© 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.
