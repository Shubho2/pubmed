In this study, we synthesized single-domain 15-kDaantibody SBT-100 (anti-STAT3 B VHH13) against human STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) that binds selectively to STAT3 and suppresses thefunction of phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3).Methods: Single-chain VHH nanobodies were generated by immunizing camelid withhumanized STAT3. Commercially available breast cancer cell lines includingMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, MCF-7, and BT474 were used. Cellproliferation was determined by3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Theassociation of anti-STAT3 B VHH13 with STAT3 and p-STAT3 was determined byimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses. The efficacy of SBT-100 on thegrowth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts in vivo was determined using athymic mice.Statistical significance for cell proliferation was determined using analysis of variance. If a significant difference (P < .05) was observed, then Tukey-Kramermultiple comparison test was conducted.Results: SBT-100 suppressed cell proliferation of triple-negative breast cancercells (P < .01) as well as provided significant inhibition of tumor growth(P < .05) in a xenograft model without any toxicity. Results are presented toshow that anti-STAT3 B VHH13 selectively binds to STAT3 suggesting that theeffects were mediated by inhibiting STAT3.Conclusions: A very large number of human malignancies and benign diseases haveconstitutive STAT3 activation. Therefore, the results described here suggest thatanti-STAT3 B VHH13 can be developed for therapeutic intervention for cancer cellsexpressing STAT3 or p-STAT3.DOI: 10.1177/1178223417750858 PMCID: PMC5802608PMID: 29434474
