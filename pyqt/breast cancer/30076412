Despite decades of research, attempts to effectively inhibit MYC,particularly with small molecules, still remain challenging due to thefeatureless nature of its protein structure. Herein, we describe the engineering of the dominant-negative MYC peptide (OmoMYC) linked to a functional penetrating 'Phylomer' peptide (FPPa) as a therapeutic strategy to inhibit MYC in TNBC. Wefound FPPa-OmoMYC to be a potent inducer of apoptosis (with IC50 from 1-2 µM) in TNBC cells with negligible effects in non-tumorigenic cells. Transcriptomeanalysis of FPPa-OmoMYC-treated cells indicated that the fusion protein inhibitedMYC-dependent networks, inducing dynamic changes in transcriptional, metabolic,and apoptotic processes. We demonstrated the efficacy of FPPa-OmoMYC ininhibiting breast cancer growth when injected orthotopically in TNBC allografts. Lastly, we identified strong pharmacological synergisms between FPPa-OmoMYC andchemotherapeutic agents. This study highlights a novel therapeutic approach totarget highly aggressive and chemoresistant MYC-activated cancers.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0421-y PMID: 30076412
