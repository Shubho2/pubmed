Multicellular tumour spheroids (MTS) can be used as an ex vivocancer tumour model, to model in vivo nanoparticle (NP) uptake by the enhancedpermeability and retention (EPR) effect. Surface enhanced spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SESORS) combines both surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)and spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) to yield enhanced Raman signals atmuch greater sub-surface levels. By utilizing a reporter that has an electronictransition in resonance with the laser frequency, surface enhanced resonanceRaman scattering (SERRS) yields even greater enhancement in Raman signal. Using ahandheld SORS spectrometer with back scattering optics, we demonstrate thedetection of live breast cancer 3D MTS containing SERRS active NPs through 15 mm of porcine tissue. False color 2D heat intensity maps were used to determinetumour model location. In addition, we demonstrate the tracking of SERRS-activeNPs through porcine tissue to depths of up to 25 mm. This unprecedentedperformance is due to the use of red-shifted chalcogenpyrylium-based Ramanreporters to demonstrate the novel technique of surface enhanced spatially offsetresonance Raman spectroscopy (SESORRS) for the first time. Our resultsdemonstrate a significant step forward in the ability to detect vibrationalfingerprints from a tumour model at depth through tissue. Such an approach offerssignificant promise for the translation of NPs into clinical applications fornon-invasive disease diagnostics based on this new chemical principle ofmeasurement.DOI: 10.1039/c8sc00994e PMCID: PMC5939614PMID: 29780511
