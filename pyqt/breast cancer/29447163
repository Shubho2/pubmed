We ascertained 3,499 grandmother/granddaughter pairs from the Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry at the Roswell Park Cancer Instituteobserving 892 informative pairs with 157 affected granddaughters. We performedgermline X-chromosome exome sequencing on 186 women with ovarian cancer from the registry. The rate of cancers was 28.4% in paternal grandmother/granddaughterpairs and 13.9% in maternal pairs consistent with an X-linked dominant model(Chi-square test X2 = 0.02, p = 0.89) and inconsistent with an autosomal dominantmodel (X2 = 20.4, p<0.001). Paternal grandmother cases had an earlierage-of-onset versus maternal cases (hazard ratio HR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.12-2.25)independent of BRCA1/2 status. Reinforcing the X-linked hypothesis, we observedan association between prostate cancer in men and ovarian cancer in his motherand daughters (odds ratio, OR = 2.34, p = 0.034). Unaffected mothers withaffected daughters produced significantly more daughters than sons (ratio = 1.96,p<0.005). We performed exome sequencing in reported BRCA negative cases from the registry. Considering age-of-onset, one missense variant (rs176026 in MAGEC3)reached chromosome-wide significance (Hazard ratio HR = 2.85, 95%CI: 1.75-4.65)advancing the age of onset by 6.7 years. In addition to the well-knowncontribution of BRCA, we demonstrate that a genetic locus on the X-chromosomecontributes to ovarian cancer risk. An X-linked pattern of inheritance hasimplications for genetic risk stratification. Women with an affected paternalgrandmother and sisters of affected women are at increased risk for ovariancancer. Further work is required to validate this variant and to characterizecarrier families.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1007194 PMCID: PMC5813894PMID: 29447163  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
