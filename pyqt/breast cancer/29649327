Differentmethods have been used to determine the SLN status intraoperatively, e.g. frozen section histology (FS) and touch imprint cytology (TIC). The sensitivity ofintraoperative TIC examination on SLN is not consistent between different studiesand varies according to different tumor histologic subtypes, tumor size and theage of the patient. The aim of this study was to describe the specificity andsensitivity of TIC and to compare TIC sensitivity in the different histologicalsubtypes of breast carcinoma.METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 1227 consecutive clinically nodenegative breast cancer patients treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)with intraoperative TIC between the years 2003 and 2008. The SLN was bisected andstained using the May-Grünwald-Giemsa method and immunocytochemically with theantibody MNF-116.RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of the TIC test was 68.6% and the specificitywas 99.8%. There was no statistically significant difference between thedetection of SLN metastases from ductal carcinoma versus lobular carcinoma. Thesensitivity improved over the period of the study.CONCLUSION: TIC is highly specific with an acceptable overall sensitivity. Thesensitivity increased under the period of the study and it was higher in caseswith larger size of the primary tumor. There was no difference in TIC sensitivitybetween the different histological subtypes.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0195560 PMCID: PMC5896963PMID: 29649327  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
