[Epub ahead ofprint]Examining the effect of 5-HTTLPR on depressive symptoms in postmenopausal women1 year after initial breast cancer treatment.Wang JS(1), Conley YP(1), Sereika SM(1), Bender CM(1), Godbole P(1), WesmillerSW(2).Author information: (1)School of Nursing, University of Pittsburgh, 440 Victoria Building,Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, USA.(2)School of Nursing, University of Pittsburgh, 440 Victoria Building,Pittsburgh, PA, 15261, USA. swe100@pitt.edu.BACKGROUND: Depression following the diagnosis of breast cancer has been welldocumented, and occurs in as many as 40% of women. The serotonin transporter geneSLC6A4 and its functional polymorphism 5-HTTLPR have been extensively studied as factors in the development of depression. Many research studies have demonstratedconflicting results, and the contribution of 5-HTTLPR to depression is unclear.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the relationship betweendepressive symptoms and serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms between womenwith early-stage breast cancer 1 year following initial diagnosis and surgery andmatched controls.METHODS: Participants (N = 125), included postmenopausal women following breastcancer surgery (n = 80) and age-and education-matched healthy controls (n = 45). The genetic elements of interest were the long (LA) and short (S) alleles of5-HTTLPR, as well as the single nucleotide polymorphism rs25531 A > G within the L-allele (LG). DNA was extracted from either blood or saliva and analyzed for theSLC6A4 polymorphisms. The outcome measures for this longitudinal study includedBeck Depression Inventory scores and physical function domain scores from theMedical Outcome Study Short Form 36.RESULTS: Women with breast cancer demonstrated greater depressive symptomatology and decreased physical function compared to healthy controls. The LA/LA genotype was associated with increased depressive symptomatology in the overall sample andwithin the controls. The LA/LA genotype appeared with greater frequency in theexperimental group, but the relationship with increased depressive symptoms wasnot observed. Physical function was a significant (p < 0.00) predictor ofdepressive symptoms in both groups at 12 months.CONCLUSION: The relationship between 5-HTTLPR and depressive symptomatology inbreast cancer patients remains unclear. A potential clinical application includesmonitoring physical function and addressing increased depressive symptoms asphysical function declines.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4332-9 PMID: 29982901
