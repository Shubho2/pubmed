China.Cancer metastasis and relapse are the primary cause of mortality for patientswith breast cancer. The present study performed quantitative proteomic analysison the differentially expressed proteins between highly metastatic breast cancer cells and parental cells. It was revealed that forkhead box P2 (FOXP2), atranscription factor in neural development, may become a potential inhibitor ofbreast cancer metastasis. The results demonstrated that patients with a lowerlevel of FOXP2 expression had significantly poorer relapse-free survival(P=0.0047). The transcription of FOXP2 was also significantly downregulated inbreast cancer tissue compared with normal breast tissue (P=0.0005). In addition, FOXP2 may inhibit breast cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro. It was alsorevealed that the underlying mechanism may include the epithelial-mesenchymaltransition process driven by the tumor growth factor β/SMAD signaling pathway. Inconclusion, the present study identified FOXP2 as a novel suppressor andprognostic marker of breast cancer metastasis. These results may provide further insight into breast cancer prevention and the development of novel treatments.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8402 PMCID: PMC5950580PMID: 29805593
