[Epub ahead of print]Palladium(ii) and platinum(ii) saccharinate complexes withbis(diphenylphosphino)methane/ethane: synthesis, S-phase arrest and ROS-mediated apoptosis in human colon cancer cells.Icsel C(1), Yilmaz VT(1), Aygun M(2), Cevatemre B(3), Alper P(4), Ulukaya E(4).Author information: (1)Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Uludag University,16059 Bursa, Turkey. vtyilmaz@uludag.edu.tr.(2)Department of Physics, Faculty of Sciences, Dokuz Eylul University, 35210Izmir, Turkey.(3)Department of Biology, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Uludag University, 16059 Bursa, Turkey.(4)Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University ofIstinye, 34010 Istanbul, Turkey.New neutral [M(sac)2(diphos)] and cationic [M(diphos)2](sac)2 complexes, where M = PdII or PtII, sac = saccharinate, and diphos =1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm) or 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane(dppe), were synthesized and structurally characterized. The anticancer activity of the complexes was investigated against MCF-7 (breast), A549 (lung), HCT116(colon), DU145 (prostate) cancer and BEAS-2B (normal bronchial epithelial) cells.Neutral Pt-dppm (2) and Pd-dppe complexes (5) did not show any biologicalactivity. The cationic Pd-dppe (7) complex displayed antiproliferative activity, while the rest of the complexes exhibited potent cytotoxicity compared withcisplatin. The active Pd(ii)/Pt(ii) complexes were then included in furtherstudies including interaction with DNA/HSA, nuclease activity, cellular uptakeand lipophilicity. The potent complexes induced the apoptotic cell death asprobed through annexin V positivity and caspase activation. Mechanistic studieson HCT116 cells showed that the complexes cause cell cycle arrest at the DNAsynthesis (S) phase and excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS),damaging to both mitochondria and DNA.DOI: 10.1039/c8dt02389a PMID: 30062356
