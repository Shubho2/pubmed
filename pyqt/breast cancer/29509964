This study aimed to assess left atrial appendage (LAA) volume and function by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and to explore its value in predicting PAF recurrence after RFCA.METHODS: Eighty patients with PAF were recruited. The left atrial (LA) and LAAvolume and function were measured by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and TEEbefore ablation. Patients were followed up for 12 months after RFCA, andrecurrence was recorded. Odds ratios of candidate risk indicators were determinedby logistic regression analysis. Prediction model was constructed using logistic regression with backward selection. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curvewith area under curve (AUC) was performed to evaluate the prediction efficiency.RESULTS: Twenty-four (30%) PAF patients had recurrence (R group), and 56 (70%)patients had no recurrence (NR group). Compared to NR group, LA dimension (LAD), LA volume index (LAVI), LAA maximum volume (LAAVmax), and LAA minimum volume(LAAVmin) were significantly higher in R group, while LAA peak emptying flowvelocity (LAAeV), LAA peak filling flow velocity (LAAfV), and LAA ejectionfraction (LAAEF) significantly declined in R group. According to multivariateanalysis and backward selection, LAVI, LAAEF, and LAAeV were significant riskfactors for PAF recurrence. The LAVI + LAAEF + LAAeV joint model couldeffectively predict PAF recurrence with AUC of 0.893 (95% confidenceinterval = 0.816, 0.970), sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of 0.929.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that LAVI, LAAEF, and LAAeV were significantpredictors of PAF recurrence after RFCA.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/echo.13856 PMID: 29509964
