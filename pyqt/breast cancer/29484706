Next-generation sequencing (NGS) isamong the best available options for genetic screening, providing severalbenefits that include enhanced sensitivity and unbiased mutation detection. PALB2(partner and localizer of BRCA2) is a cancer predisposing gene recently describedthat encodes a protein partner of BRCA2 involved in DNA double-strand breakrepair and cell cycle control. The DNA damage response represents a key cellular event, targeted by innovative anticancer therapies, including those based on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors targeting PARP1 and PARP2 enzymes,activated by DNA damage and involved in single-strand break and base excisionrepair.METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from 34 patient samples and four BC cell lines,as controls, and 27 breast cancer predisposing genes belonging to the BRCA1/BRCA2and PARP pathways were sequenced by NGS.RESULTS: The panel described here allowed identification of several sequencevariations in most investigated genes, among which we found a novel truncatingmutation in PALB2.CONCLUSIONS: The NGS-based strategy designed here for molecular analysis of acustomized panel of BC predisposing and related genes was found to performeffectively, providing a comprehensive exploration of all genomic sequences ofthe investigated genes. It is thus useful for BC molecular diagnosis, inparticular for familiar cases where alterations in routinely investigated genes, such as BRCAs, result to be absent.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcla.22418 PMID: 29484706
