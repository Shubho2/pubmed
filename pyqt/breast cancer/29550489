The lncRNA X inactive specifictranscript (XIST) is a potential tumour suppressor in some types of cancers.However, the expression and function of XIST in breast cancer remain largelyunclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression andbiological role of XIST in breast cancer. The results showed that XIST wassignificantly down-regulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Furtherfunctional analysis indicated that overexpression of XIST remarkably inhibitedbreast cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion. The results of luciferasereporter assays verified that miR-155 was a direct target of XIST in breastcancer. Moreover, caudal-type homeobox 1 (CDX1) was identified as a direct targetof miR-155 and miR-155/CDX1 rescued the effects of XIST in breast cancer cells.Taken together, our results suggest that XIST is down-regulated in breast cancer and suppresses breast cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion via themiR-155/CDX1 axis.Copyright Â© 2018.
