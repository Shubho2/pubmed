We also sought to determine factors possibly influencing outcomes and changesover time in the duration of survival after recurrence.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 9671 patients with breast cancer treatedbetween January 1993 and December 2008, comparing the periods 1993-2002 and2003-2008.We retrospectively reviewed the collected database including the age atdiagnosis, clinical manifestations, pathology report, surgical methods, types of adjuvant treatment modalities, type of recurrence, and follow-up period.RESULTS: There were 1944 cases (20.1%) of recurrence. Median age at the firstrecurrence was 49.5 years (range 21.8-92.9). Median follow-up was 28.8 months(range 0-228.0) from the time of relapse. Median survival time was 35.0 months.Survival after recurrence (SAR) significantly improved in 2003-2008 compared tothat in 1993-2002. Median survival time increased from 27.6 months in the period I to 42.3 months in period II (p = 0.001). Independent prognostic factors afterthe first recurrence by multivariate analysis were age at diagnosis, tumor size, nodal status, tumor grade, subtype, anti-hormonal therapy, time at diagnosis, anddisease-free interval.CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of breast cancer have been improving recently, and survivaltime after the first recurrence of breast cancer has steadily increased in recentdecades. We confirmed that advances in treatments have contributed to thisimprovement in survival after the first recurrence.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0869-1 PMID: 29786773
