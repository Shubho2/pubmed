As aproxy of collective interest in BC screanning (BCS) we studied the monthlyaccesses to BC and BCS webpages in INCA's website along 48 months. A log analyzerbuilt a time serie (2006-2009) of BC and BCS monthly means, which oscilationswere studied by analysis of variance (ANOVA). We found significant increasingaccesses to BC and transient "attention peaks". Enlargement in BC/BCS differencesalong all period were caused by increasing accesses to BC anddecreasing/minor/stable oscillations to SBC pages. These results are consistentwith previous reports on increasing interest to BC contrasting with indifference on BCS. In the context of an exploratory study, we discussed some aspects:weakness of a "prevention culture"; lack of confidence in health system andscreening programs; "celebrity effect" in the context of media framing;collective perception of risks heightened by perception of social vulnerability. Findings suggest that culture-tailored communication strategies would benecessary to inform Brazilian people about BCS. Future research is needed tostudy social perceptions and constructions on BC topics.DOI: 10.1590/1413-81232018234.14082016 PMID: 29694575
