[Epub ahead of print]Uptake of Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis in Female BRCA1 and BRCA2 MutationCarriers.Mor P(1), Brennenstuhl S(2), Metcalfe KA(2).Author information: (1)Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel. pmor@szmc.org.il.(2)University of Toronto, 155 College Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5T 1P8, Canada.Women with a germline pathogenic variant in the BReast CAncer susceptibilitygenes (BRCA1 or BRCA2) have an increased risk of early-onset breast and ovariancancer. In addition to weighing cancer screening and risk-reduction options,healthy BRCA mutation carriers of childbearing age may choose to preclude passingthe mutation to the next generation. In the current study, we report onpreimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) practices in BRCA-positive Israeli women who were offered PGD at no cost.METHODS: we measured PGD uptake, decisionsatisfaction or regret, and predictors of uptake. Of the 70 participant femalecarriers, only 25.7% chose to use PGD to prevent transmission of the mutation,and were not predicted by age or religious affiliation. For those who choseIVF/PGD, satisfaction with the decision regarding IVF and PGD was significantlyhigher than those who did not have IVF and PGD (p < 0.04). Experiencing previous infertility was the only significant predictor of uptake of IVF/PGD (p < 0.001), which may suggest that BRCA status is secondary to infertility in thedecision-making process for PGD in women with a BRCA mutation.DOI: 10.1007/s10897-018-0264-2 PMID: 29858758
