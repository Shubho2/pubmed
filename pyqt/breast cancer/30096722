[Epub ahead of print]Exercise Training-Induced Modulation in Microenvironment of Rat MammaryNeoplasms.Figueira ACC(1)(2), Figueira MC(3), Silva C(1), Padrão A(1)(4), Oliveira PA(5),Ferreira RP(4), Duarte JA(1).Author information: (1)CIAFEL, Research Center in Physical Activity, Health and Leisure; Faculty ofSport, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.(2)Polytechnic Institute of Setúbal, Setúbal, Portugal, Department of Sciencesand Technologies/Sport Sciences, Setúbal, Portugal.(3)Department of Internal Medicine, Setúbal Hospital Center.(4)QOPNA, Department of Chemistry, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.(5)CITAB, Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Trás-os-Montes andAlto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal.Despite the importance attributed to exercise training in the breast cancer (BC) continuum, the underlying mechanisms modulating tumor behavior are unknown. Weevaluated the effects of long-term moderate-exercise in the development ofmammary tumors, and studied the microenvironment of infiltrative lesions, theamount of connective tissue, and balance between cellularproliferation/death.Fifty Sprague-Dawley rats, randomly assigned into fourgroups: two control groups (sedentary and exercised) and two models of BC groups (sedentary and exercised) induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosoureia (MNU), weresacrificed after 35 weeks of moderate-exercise, and all perceptible tumors wereremoved for histological and immunohistochemistry analysis.The median number ofinfiltrative-lesions per animal was lower in the MNU exercised animals (p=0.02). More than one histological pattern was identified, and papillary carcinoma wasthe most frequent in both groups. Within infiltrative-lesions, the number ofimmunopositive cells per μm2 of Ki67 was lower in exercised animals (p=0.002).This presents increased cell death per μm2 (p=0.019). Tumors from sedentaryanimals had a higher expression of collagen deposition (p=0.027).Long-termmoderate-exercise has beneficial effects in tumor development with a diminishedprevalence of malignancy. Within infiltrative-lesions, moderate-exercise improvesthe balance between cell-proliferation and cell-death with decreased connectivetissue that suggests lower tumor aggressiveness.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.DOI: 10.1055/a-0660-0198 PMID: 30096722
