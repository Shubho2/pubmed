This review aims to update existingliterature and evaluate the key components of such models with a focus on breast,colorectal, and adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors.METHODS: The PubMed electronic database were searched comprehensively forrelevant publications in English through February 2017. Additional manualsearches were conducted for reference lists and official guidelines published by oncology societies. Included studies addressed the correct cancer type,elaborated on each model's structure and provided patient-related outcome data tosupport its model's effectiveness if applicable.RESULTS: Among the 25 included studies, six articles described survivorshipmodels applicable to all cancer types, and the remaining focused on breast cancer(n = 10), colorectal cancer (n = 3), and AYA cancer survivors (n = 6).Shared-care model was largely described for all cancer types whereasmultidisciplinary model predominated for AYA cancer survivors. Upon evaluation,these models described the essential components of survivorship care fairly well except for the care coordination component. Also, the definition of time pointsof care was vague and noncomprehensive.CONCLUSION: The reviewed survivorship model studies were comprehensive but werelimited by a lack of existing rigorous evaluation efforts to assess theireffectiveness. This review further provided valuable recommendations for futuremethodological evaluation of such models. This review has highlighted carecoordination as an area for improvement and emphasized the importance ofobtaining data on the effectiveness of these survivorship models to ensuresatisfactory quality of life and health outcomes.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4197-y PMID: 29696424
