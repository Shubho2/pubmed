Here, we examined and compared the cytotoxic effects of Que and its water-soluble metabolites,isorhamnetin (IS) and isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide (I3G), in human breast-cancerMCF-7 cells to uncover their tumor-inhibitory mechanisms and structure-functionrelationships. The results showed that Que, IS, and I3G could dose-dependentlyinhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells, and the cytotoxic effect was ranked as Que >IS > I3G. Furthermore, Que, IS, and I3G mediated cell-cycle arrest principally inS phase, followed by a decrease in the number of cells in G0/G1 and G2/M;moreover, 70.8, 68.9, and 49.8% of MCF-7 tumor cells entered early-phaseapoptosis when treated with 100 Î¼M Que, IS, and I3G for 48 h, respectively.Moreover, induction of apoptosis by Que, IS, and I3G was accompanied by themarginal generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Given theseresults, Que, IS, and I3G possess strong cytotoxic effects through anROS-dependent apoptosis pathway in MCF-7 cells.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jafc.8b02420 PMID: 29905475
