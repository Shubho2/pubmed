They may also be responsible for tumor initiation. Cancer stem cells are resistant to chemoand radiotherapy. Eradication of CSCs may involve theapplication of salinomycin, metformin and Clostridium perfringens; the effect of anti-angiogenic factors remains controversial. Salinomycin is an antibioticisolated from Streptomyces albus bacteria. Its CSC-eradicating effect has beendemonstrated both in ovarian cancer cell lines and in women with breast cancer.Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) has been demonstrated to destroy CSCsin ovarian cancer both in vivo and in vitro. Metformin, apart from itshypoglycemic effect, reduces the CSC population and inhibits the proliferation ofneoplastic cells and angiogenesis. Cancer stem cells with expression of VEGFR1+have been described as affecting circulating cancer cells and influencing theformation of metastases. Both positive and negative effects of anti-angiogenictherapy on the CSC population have been documented.DOI: 10.17219/acem/73999 PMID: 29938937
