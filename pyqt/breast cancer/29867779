Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) with relevant predictive values, SNPs in the ZNF423 genewere associated with decreased risk of BC during SERM therapy, and SNPs in theCathepsin O gene with an increased risk. ZNF423, which was not previouslyassociated with BC is a multifunctional transcription factor known to have a rolein development, neurogenesis, and adipogenesis and is implicated in other typesof cancer. ZNF423 is transcriptionally controlled by the homolog ZNF521, early B cell factor transcription factor, epigenetic silencing of the promoter by CpGisland hyper-methylation, and also by ZNF423 itself in an auto-regulatory loop.In BC cells, ZNF423 expression is found to be induced by estrogen, dependent onthe binding of the estrogen receptor and calmodulin-like 3 to SNPs in ZNP423intronic sites in proximity to consensus estrogen response elements. ZNF423 hasalso been shown to play a mechanistic role by trans-activating the tumorsuppressor BRCA1 and thus modulating the DNA damage response. Even though recent extensive trial studies did not classify these SNPs with the highest predictivevalues, for inclusion in polygenic SNP analysis, the mechanism unveiled in these studies has introduced ZNF423 as a factor important in the control of theestrogen response. Here, we aim at providing an overview of ZNF423 expression andfunctional role in human malignancies, with a specific focus on its implicationin hormone-responsive BC.DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00255 PMCID: PMC5968090PMID: 29867779
