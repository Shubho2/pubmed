We assessed the risk prediction ability (validity) of Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram for non-sentinel lymph node metastasesand analysed the outcome of patients with sentinel node metastases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: All operable early breast cancer patients with sentinelnode macro metastases (size > 2mm) who underwent axillary dissection from April2009 to March 2015 were considered eligible. The risk of non-sentinel lymph node metastases was calculated using an online MSKCC calculator, and accuracy wasdetermined based on the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve(AUC-ROC). Tumour characteristics and overall survival were also analysed assecondary end points.RESULTS: Of 1745 patients who were diagnosed with operable breast cancer duringthe study period, 114 patients were considered eligible. The AUC-ROC was 0.66suggestive of lesser accuracy in prediction and not statistically significant (p value = 0.7303). Seventysix (50.7%) of these patients did not have anynon-sentinel node metastases. At a mean follow up of four years, the disease-freesurvival was 86.4% and overall survival rate was 88.4%.CONCLUSIONS: The MSKCC nomogram was unable to accurately predict the risk in our cohort of patients with more than half of this cohort of patients not requiringaxillary dissection. These findings are consistent with other European studies.This study thus highlights the need for modified prediction model for Europeancohorts.PMCID: PMC5902139PMID: 29549676
