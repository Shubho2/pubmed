Cancer stem cell (CSC) model has been proposedas a hypothesis for the lethality of breast cancer. Molecular mechanismsunderlying CSC maintenance are still unclear. In this study, we generatedmammospheres derived from breast cancer MDA-MB231 cells and MCF7 cells to enrich CSCs and performed DNA microarray analysis. We found that the expression ofcarboxy terminus of HSP70-interacting protein (CHIP) E3 ubiquitin ligase wassignificantly downregulated in breast CSCs. CHIP depletion increased mammosphere formation, whereas CHIP overexpression reversed this effect. We identifiedinteractomes by mass spectrometry and detected CHIP directly interacted withOCT4, a stemness factor. CHIP overexpression decreased OCT4 stability throughproteasomal degradation. CHIP induced OCT4 ubiquitination, whereas H260Q, acatalytic CHIP mutant, did not. Interestingly, we determined that OCT4 wasubiquitinated at lysine 284, and CHIP overexpression did not degrade K284R mutantOCT4. CHIP overexpression decreased the proliferation and side population ofbreast cancer cells, but these were not occurred in K284R mutant OCT4overexpressed cells. Only 1000 cells showing CHIP depletion or OCT4overexpression sufficiently generated breast tumors and lung metastases inxenografted mice. Ubiquitination-defective mutant of OCT4(K284R) overexpressedcells drastically generated tumor burdens in mice. Patients with breast cancerwho showed low CHIP expression had poor survival probability. Taken together, we suggest that CHIP-induced OCT4 ubiquitination is important in breast CSCs.Regulation of CHIP expression and OCT4 protein stability is a considerableapproach for breast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41418-018-0079-6 PMID: 29511337
