Aorticvalve replacement (AVR) should be considered for some cancer patients, butneither the characteristics nor prognosis under conservative therapy is wellknown.We searched our echocardiography log (years 2005-2014) for cancer patients with AS, and 92 patients (54% female) were included in the study. To compare the survival curves, 470 control patients without AS were selected from our cancerregistry.Mean age (± SD) was 77.6 ± 6.7 years for males and 81.6 ± 6.3 years for females. Mean aortic valve area (AVA) was 1.0 ± 0.3 cm2. Stomach, blood, andurinary bladder cancers were the major sites of current cancer. During the 5-yearfollow-up period, 44 patients with AS (48%) died; 26 (59%) due to cancerprogression, 10 (23%) heart failure, and 4 (9%) stroke. Heart-failure death wassignificantly higher for patients with AS than for control patients (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were worse for stage I or II patients with AVA < 0.75 cm2 than for control patients (P = 0.016). Older age, advanced stages,absence of dyslipidemia, recent syncope, and chronic heart failure or AVA < 0.75 cm2 were signiﬁcantly and independently associated with poor survival.Althoughthe majority of cancer patients with AS died of cancer, a quarter died of heartfailure. Careful follow-up is needed because cancer patients at earlier stageswith symptomatic AS or AVA < 0.75 cm2 should be considered for AVR.DOI: 10.1536/ihj.17-320 PMID: 29877303
