The lmo2 gene was traditionally recognized as a proto-oncogenein hematopoietic system but its functions in breast cancers remained largelyunclear. Based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset, herein wefound that the significantly LMO2-correlated genes in normal or malignant sampleswere enriched in rather divergent cellular pathways, suggesting the functioncomplexity of LMO2 in breast tissues. Moreover, high LMO2 expression level wasfound to predict a shorter patient survival in Luminal A type whereas a betteroutcome in Her2 type. Correspondingly, LMO2 also revealed function diversities indifferent PAM50 subtypes. In Luminal A type, the LMO2 related genes wereprimarily enriched in cancer-promoting pathways, including VEGF production,stemness, PPAR signal pathways, MAPK cascade and cell cycle regulation. In Her2type however, the LMO2 related genes lacked the enrichment on most of thegenerally cancer-related pathways and were particularly enriched in negativeregulation of ErbB pathway as well as MAPK cascade, suggesting a potentiallyanti-oncogenic role of LMO2 on this subtype. Taken together, this study drew acomprehensive overview of divergent functions of LMO2 on breast cancers, providedadditional evidence for the function complexity of LMO2 in solid tumors andsuggested the potential usage of LMO2 as a PAM50 subtype dependent biomarker for breast cancer clinic in the precision medicine era.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23542 PMCID: PMC5823636PMID: 29507663
