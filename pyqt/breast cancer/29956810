China.Cancer represents a significant challenge for humankind, as early diagnosis andtreatment are difficult to achieve. To systemically investigate the effect ofsex, body mass index (BMI) and age on cancer incidence and prognosis, the datafrom 14,504 cases of cancer were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). BMI was used to categorize each person as underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese. Two‑ and five‑year survival rates were applied to estimate theprognosis for each cancer type. All data were statistically analyzed. Weidentified that males were more susceptible to lung, liver and skin cancer whencompared with females, whereas females were more susceptible to thyroid, breastand adrenal cortex cancer. High BMI (>25) was positively associated with theoccurrence of cancer, although patients with high BMI at the time of initialdiagnosis had higher two/five‑year survival rates. The survival rates for cancer were positively correlated with the age at initial pathologic diagnosis. Sometypes of cancer were associated with particularly young ages of onset, including adrenocortical carcinoma, cervical and endocervical cancers, brain lower gradeglioma, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, testicular germ cell tumors andthyroid carcinoma. Hence, the early diagnosis and prognosis for these cancersneed to be improved. In conclusion, sex, BMI and age are associated with theincidence and survival rates for cancers. These results could be used tosupplement precision and personalized medicine.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6529 PMID: 29956810
