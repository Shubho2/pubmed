Despite the fact thata mounting body of case-control studies has concentrated on investigating theassociation of the ERCC1 rs11615 polymorphism and breast cancer risk, there isstill no consensus on it. We conducted the current meta-analysis of all eligible articles to reach a much more explicit conclusion on this ambiguous association. A total of seven studies involving 2354 breast cancer cases and 2193 controlswere elaborately selected for this analysis from the Embase, EBSCO, PubMed,WanFang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Pooledodds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated in our meta-analysis. We found that the ERCC1 rs11615 polymorphism was significantlyassociated with breast cancer risk under all genetic models. When excluded, thestudies that deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), the pooled resultsof what remained significantly increase the risk of breast cancer under theallele model (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.02-1.27, P=0.02), heterozygote model (OR =1.24, 95% CI = 1.06-1.44, P=0.007), and dominant model (OR = 1.21, 95% CI =1.05-1.41, P=0.01). This increased breast cancer risk was found in Asianpopulation as well as under the heterozygote model (OR = 1.24, 95% CI =1.05-1.48, P=0.013) and dominant model (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.02-1.42, P=0.03).Our results suggest that the ERCC1 rs11615 polymorphism is associated with breastcancer susceptibility, and in particular, this increased risk of breast cancerexistence in Asian population.© 2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BSR20180440 PMCID: PMC6013698PMID: 29752341
