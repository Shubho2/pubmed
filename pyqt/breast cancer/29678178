The aim of this study is to study the status of lipid and lipoprotein in female breast cancer patients at initial diagnosis and during chemotherapy.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the status of the lipid andlipoprotein in 1054 primarily diagnosed breast cancer patients and 2483 normalcontrols with age stratification, from July 2015 to October 2016. At the sametime, the status of lipid and lipoprotein were also analyzed among 394 breastcancer patients before and after adjuvant chemotherapy.RESULTS: The incidence of dyslipidemia was significantly lower in breast cancergroup(42.98%) compared to normal group(58.28%)(P < 0.001). The levels of totalcholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL cholesterol(LDL-C) among breast cancer group were significantly lower compared to normalcontrol group (P < 0.05). With age stratification, the levels of TC and LDL-C in breast cancer group were still significantly lower than those in control group(P < 0.001). And the levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, apolipoprotein B were significantlyhigher among post chemotherapeutic patients compared to prechemotherapeuticpatients, however HDL-C and Apo-A1 levels were contrary.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients have lower incidence of dyslipidemia comparedto normal populations. However, the situation of dyslipidemia may become worsenedafter chemotherapy. Therefore, lipid monitoring and dyslipidemia prevention andtreatment should be conducted for breast cancer patients at initial diagnosis andduring chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1186/s12944-018-0745-1 PMCID: PMC5910614PMID: 29678178
