[Epub ahead of print]Clusterin, a novel DEC1 target, modulates DNA damage-mediated cell death.Ming X(1), Bao C(1), Hong T(1), Yang Y(1), Chen X(2), Jung YS(3), Qian Y(4).Author information: (1)Nanjing Agricultural University.(2)Comparative Oncology Laboratory, University of California, Davis.(3)Preventive Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University.(4)Nanjing Agricultural University yqian@njau.edu.cn.Differentiated embryonic chondrocyte expressed gene 1 (BHLHE40 also known asSharp2/Stra13/DEC1), is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor thatplays an important role in circadian rhythms, cell proliferation, apoptosis,cellular senescence, hypoxia response, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition(EMT) of tumor cells. Secretory clusterin (sCLU) is a cytoprotective protein thatguards against genotoxic stresses. Here, clusterin (CLU) was identified as anovel target gene of DEC1 and suppresses DNA damage-induced cell death in tumorcells. Mechanistically, based on chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) andluciferase assays, DEC1 binds to and activates the promoter of the CLU gene. DEC1and DNA damaging agents induce sCLU expression; while DEC1 knockdown decreasesthe expression of sCLU upon DNA damage. Moreover, the data demonstrate that DEC1 inhibits, whereas sCLU knockdown enhances DNA damage-induced cell death in MCF7breast cancer cells. Given that DEC1 and sCLU are frequently overexpressed inbreast cancers, these data provide mechanistic insight into DEC1 as apro-survival factor by up-regulating sCLU to reduce the DNA damage-inducedapoptotic response. Together, this study reveals sCLU as a novel target of DEC1which modulates the sensitivity of the DNA damage response.IMPLICATIONS: DEC1 andsCLU are frequently overexpressed in breast cancer, and targeting thesCLU-mediated cytoprotective signaling pathway may be a novel therapeuticapproach.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-0070 PMID: 30002194
