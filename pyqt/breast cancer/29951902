Thepurpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of health education inimproving the knowledge and practices of female teachers regarding screeningtools and the early detection of breast cancer. A two-group quasi-experimentaldesign was conducted among 150 female teachers, who were selected from 75 schoolsof the Jazan General Administration of Education. Schools were chosen by a simplecluster randomization method and non-randomly assigned to either the interventionor control group. Eligible participants were recruited by a simple randomization method, proportional to the total number of teachers at each school. Those in theintervention group (n = 75) were compared to the control group (n = 75) atbaseline, as well as at 6 weeks and 3 months post-intervention. Knowledge ofbreast cancer screening tools was measured using a modified version of the BreastCancer Knowledge test. Breast self-examination, clinical breast examination, and mammography practices were also measured. Compared to the control group, theintervention group showed a statistically significant increase in knowledge andpractice levels at both 6 weeks and 3 months post-intervention. Thus, the resultsof this study provide evidence that group health education programs are effectivein improving breast cancer knowledge and practices in female teachers.CLINICALTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03398057 .DOI: 10.1007/s13187-018-1386-9 PMID: 29951902
