Treatment options remain especially limited for the subtype of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Several signaling pathways,including NF-κB, are altered in TNBC, and the complexity of this disease implies multi-faceted pathway interactions. Given that IKKε behaves as an oncogene inbreast cancer, we hypothesized that IKKε regulates NF-κB signaling to controldiverse oncogenic functions in TNBC.METHODS: Vector expression and RNA interference were used to investigate thefunctional role of IKKε in triple-negative breast cancer cells. Viability,protein expression, NF-κB binding activity, invasion, anoikis, and spheroidformation were examined in cells expressing high or low levels of IKKε, inconjunction with p52 RNA interference or MEK inhibition.RESULTS: This study found that non-canonical NF-κB p52 levels are inverselyproportional to ΙΚΚε, and growth of TNBC cells in anchorage supportive,high-attachment conditions requires IKKε and activated MEK. Growth of these cellsin anchorage resistant conditions requires IKKε and activated MEK or p52. In thismodel, IKKε and MEK cooperate to support overall viability whereas the p52transcription factor is only required for viability in low attachment conditions,underscoring the contrasting roles of these proteins.CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the diverse functions of IKKε in TNBC andhighlights the adaptability of NF-κB signaling in maintaining cancer cellsurvival under different growth conditions. A better understanding of thediversity of NF-κB signaling may ultimately improve the development of noveltherapeutic regimens for TNBC.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4507-2 PMCID: PMC5970439PMID: 29801480
