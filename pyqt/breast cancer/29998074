The purpose of this Registry is to provide a large,prospective, non-randomized database of patient characteristics, tumorcharacteristics, surgical technique, and outcome (both aesthetic and oncologic)of the nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM).Methods: Data is entered into the ASBrS NSMR, housed within the Mastery ofSurgery Program, after patients consent to participation. Each investigatorroutinely offers NSM in their practice has obtained IRB approval and completedforms of agreement to participate in the ASBrS NSMR.Results: This data set represents a total of 1,935 NSMs performed on 1,170patients by 98 investigators from 70 institutions/sites. Of the 1,935 NSMs: 833were performed for an indication of cancer [594 invasive carcinoma and 239 forductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)] and 1,102 were prophylactic. Of the 1,170 total patients, 352 underwent a unilateral and 818 underwent a bilateral NSM.Recurrence at a mean follow-up of 31 months/median follow-up of 27 months, with arange of 9.7 to 58.3 months since surgery was 1.4% with no recurrences at thenipple or nipple areola complex (NAC). Cancer occurrence (0.3%) also did notinvolve the nipple/NAC. Overall patient satisfaction of excellent/good: 94.9% andoverall cosmesis (surgeon rated) of excellent/good was 96.4%. Overall infectionrates included flap infection of 4.4%, NAC complication rate of 4.5% (defined as necrosis/other or ischemia/epidermolysis requiring surgery), and a 10% rate ofNAC epidermolysis with full recovery.Conclusions: NSMs were performed on breasts with a variety of sizes and degreesof ptosis, via multiple incisions, dissection and reconstruction techniques with low complication rates and high patient satisfaction and surgeon rated cosmesis.DOI: 10.21037/gs.2017.09.10 PMCID: PMC6006016PMID: 29998074
