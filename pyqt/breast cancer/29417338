Although diverse molecules arecurrently being explored as targets for cancer therapy the tumor treatment andtherapy is highly tricky. Secondary messengers are important for hormone-mediatedsignaling pathway. Cyclic AMP (cAMP), a secondary messenger responsible forvarious physiological processes regulates cell metabolism by activating Proteinkinase A (PKA) and by targeting exchange protein directly activated by cAMP(EPAC). EPAC is present in two isoforms EPAC1 and EPAC2, which exhibit different tissue distribution and is involved in GDP/GTP exchange along with activatingRap1- and Rap2-mediated signaling pathways. EPAC is also known for its dual role in cancer as pro- and anti-proliferative in addition to metastasis. Results afterperturbing EPAC activity suggests its involvement in cancer cell migration,proliferation, and cytoskeleton remodeling which makes it a potential therapeutictarget for cancer treatments.DOI: 10.1007/s11010-018-3294-z PMID: 29417338
