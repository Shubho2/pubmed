China.In order to examine the prognostic significance of miR-33a in patients withhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), total RNA was extracted from 149 HCC biopsies, 36of which were paired with para-carcinoma tissues, and miR-33a expression wasmeasured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Theresults demonstrated that miR-33a expression was decreased in HCC biopsiescompared with normal liver tissue samples. It was also demonstrated that miR-33a expression was significantly associated with tumor foci number. Furthermore,overall and progression-free survival time was decreased in patients expressinglow miR-33a with multiple tumor foci. Taken together, the low expression ofmiR-33a may be a potential risk factor for HCC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7892 PMCID: PMC5835885PMID: 29541227
