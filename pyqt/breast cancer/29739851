We have recently reportedthat xyloside-primed chondroitin/dermatan sulfate derived from a human breastcarcinoma cell line, HCC70, has cytotoxic effects and shown that it differs indisaccharide composition from nontoxic chondroitin/dermatan sulfate derived from a human breast fibroblast cell line, CCD-1095Sk. To further investigate thestructural requirements for the cytotoxic effect, we developed a novel LC-MS/MSapproach based on reversed-phase dibutylamine ion-pairing chromatography andnegative-mode higher-energy collision dissociation and used it in combinationwith cell growth studies and disaccharide fingerprinting. This strategy enableddetailed structural characterization of linkage regions, internaloligosaccharides, and nonreducing ends, revealing not only differences betweenxyloside-primed chondroitin/dermatan sulfate from HCC70 cells and CCD-1095Skcells, but also sialylation of the linkage region and previously undescribedmethylation and sulfation of the nonreducing ends. Although the xyloside-primedchondroitin/dermatan sulfate from HCC70 cells was less complex in terms ofpresence and distribution of iduronic acid than that from CCD-1095Sk cells, both glucuronic acid and iduronic acid appeared to be essential for the cytotoxiceffect. Our data have moved us one step closer to understanding the structure of the cytotoxic chondroitin/dermatan sulfate from HCC70 cells primed on xylosidesand demonstrate the suitability of the LC-MS/MS approach for structuralcharacterization of glycosaminoglycans.© 2018 Persson et al.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.002971 PMCID: PMC6028968 [Available on 2019-06-29]PMID: 29739851
