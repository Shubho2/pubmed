[Epub ahead of print]A multimodal deep neural network for human breast cancer prognosis prediction by integrating multi-dimensional data.Sun D, Wang M, Li A.Breast cancer is a highly aggressive type of cancer with very low mediansurvival. Accurate prognosis prediction of breast cancer can spare a significant number of patients from receiving unnecessary adjuvant systemic treatment and itsrelated expensive medical costs. Previous work relies mostly on selected geneexpression data to create a predictive model. The emergence of deep learningmethods and multi-dimensional data offers opportunities for more comprehensiveanalysis of the molecular characteristics of breast cancer and therefore canimprove diagnosis, treatment and prevention. In this study, we propose aMultimodal Deep Neural Network by integrating Multi-dimensional Data (MDNNMD) forthe prognosis prediction of breast cancer. The novelty of the method lies in the design of our method's architecture and the fusion of multi-dimensional data. Thecomprehensive performance evaluation results show that the proposed methodachieves a better performance than the prediction methods with single-dimensionaldata and other existing approaches.
