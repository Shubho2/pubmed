Tumour contrast enhancement (CE) and ECV fraction were calculatedusing region-of-interest measurement within the pancreatic adenocarcinoma andaorta on unenhanced and equilibrium phase-enhanced CT. The effect on survivalvariables including age, sex, tumour location, tumour size, TNM stage,carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), tumour CE andtumour ECV fraction was determined on univariate and multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression model.RESULTS: Median overall survival was 10.5 months. On univariate analysis,elevated serum CA19-9 (hazard ratio (HR), 1.00; p = 0.006) and CEA (HR, 1.02; p =0.011) levels were found to be associated with a negative effect on overallsurvival. Increasing tumour CE (HR, 0.98; p < 0.001) and ECV fraction (HR, 0.97; p = 0.001) were associated with a positive effect. Multivariate analysis revealedthat only tumour ECV fraction was an independent predictor of overall survival(HR, 0.97; p = 0.012).CONCLUSIONS: ECV fraction with equilibrium contrast-enhanced MDCT could be auseful imaging biomarker for predicting patient survival after chemotherapy forunresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.KEY POINTS: • Tumour aggressiveness and response to therapy are influenced by theextravascular extracellular space. • Extracellular volume (ECV) fraction can bequantified with equilibrium contrast-enhanced CT. • Patients with higher tumourECV fraction had better prognosis after chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5570-4 PMID: 29922930
