Nm23-H1 is positively associated with prolonged disease-free survivaland good prognosis of cancer patients. Approaches to increasing the cellularlevels of Nm23-H1 therefore have significance in the therapy of metastaticcancers. We found a small molecule,(Â±)-trans-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene, thatactivates Nm23, hereafter called NMac1. NMac1 directly binds to Nm23-H1 andincreases its NDPK activity. Employing various NMac1 derivatives andhydrogen/deuterium mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we identified the pharmacophoreand mode of action of NMac1. We found that NMac1 binds to the C-terminal ofNm23-H1 and induces the NDPK activation through its allosteric conformationalchanges. NMac1-treated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells showed dramatic changes in morphology and actin-cytoskeletal organization following inhibition of Rac1activation. NMac1 also suppressed invasion and migration in vitro, and metastasisin vivo, in a breast cancer mouse model. NMac1 as an activator of NDPK haspotential as an anti-metastatic agent.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29101-6 PMCID: PMC6053448PMID: 30026594
