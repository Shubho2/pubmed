All photos of patients' tongue wererecorded by the digital camera of uniform type within 1 month after serologicalexamination and regular re-examined by computed tomography (CT), magneticresonance imaging and positron emission tomography CT. The presence of sublingualnodules was the positive standard. Chi square test and two-independent-sampletest were used to determine the diagnostic value between the status of sublingualnodules and Clinico-pathological characteristics. The optimal cut-off of uricacid (UA) level to diagnose sublingual nodules was determined by receiveroperating curve (ROC) analysis.RESULTS: Breast cancer patients with sublingual nodules had a higher risk ofrecurrence and/or metastasis than patients without it (P<0.001). Sublingualnodules was significantly correlated with increased serum UA level (P=0.001). Theoptimal cut-off value of UA level to diagnose sublingual nodules was 290 μmol/L. Furthermore, the elevated serum UA level (⩾290 μmol/L) was significantly related to breast cancer recurrence and/or metastasis (P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Sublingual nodules were potential diagnostic markers for metastatic breast cancer. The formation of sublingual nodules was associated with elevatedlevel of serum UA.DOI: 10.1007/s11655-018-2837-1 PMID: 29667148
