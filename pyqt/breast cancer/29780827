Recently, indocyaninegreen (ICG) has been proposed as an alternative sentinel lymph node (SLN)tracking agent. We evaluated the clinical value of ICG as an additional tracer incombination with Technetium99m and as an alternative to Technetium99m for theidentification of SLN in 104 breast cancer patients. 21 patients had at least 1histologically tumor-positive SLN. All 21 patients were detected by ICG; in oneof these 21 sentinel-positive patients, Technetium99m was unable to identifylymph node involvement. Our results show that ICG is as effective as theradioisotope for SLNB. In addition, as a near-infrared dye, it has the advantagesof real-time visualization, lower cost, and wider availability, since noradioactive material needs to be handled.
