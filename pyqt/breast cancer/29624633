Datawere collected using the Preparing for Life as a (New) Survivor (PLANS) scale,Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions Questionnaire (PEPPI),Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) Symptom Checklist, Satisfaction with Careand Information Scale, Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems(CAHPS) tool, Charlson Comorbidity Index adapted for patient self-report, and the12-item Short Form Health Survey. Controlling variables included age, stage asdetermined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system,educational level, and study site in multivariate analyses.RESULTS: The mean ages of Latinas and non-Latinas were 51.5 years and 56.6 years,respectively. Compared with non-Latinas, Latinas reported less BC survivorshipknowledge (27.3 vs 30.7; P<.0001), were more dissatisfied with BC careinformation (2.3 vs 3.4; P<.0001), reported lower PEPPI scores (38.2 vs 42.2; P =.03), and experienced more BCPT symptoms (6.4 vs 5.0; P = .04). No differenceswere noted regarding their confidence in survivorship care preparedness (42.7 vs 41; P = .191), satisfaction with BC survivorship care (9.6 vs 8.8; P = .298), or their discussion with physicians (9.6 vs 8.1; P = .07). These ethnic groupdifferences persisted in multivariate analyses, with the exception of PEPPI.CONCLUSIONS: Latina survivors of BC experienced disparities in BC knowledge andsatisfaction with information received, but believed themselves to be preparedfor survivorship and were as satisfied with providers, care received, anddiscussions with physicians as non-Latinas.
