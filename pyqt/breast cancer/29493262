The mean age at first cancer diagnosis was 15 years and at initial SBCdiagnosis was 38 years. Bilateral disease before the age of 51 years wasdiagnosed in 16% of the females. The majority of SBC were invasive carcinomas(92%). Among the invasive carcinomas, 39% had a histoprognostic score of III,3.1% overexpressed HER2 and 29% were triple negative. The proportion of triplenegative phenotype SBC was higher in patients older at first cancer diagnosis [RR= 1.2, 95% CI (1.1-1.3)]. 94% of triple negative SBCs developed in breast tissue which had received >20 Gy.CONCLUSION: We found a high proportion of aggressive SBC following thoracicradiotherapy in childhood or early adulthood. Advances in knowledge: SBCscreening is recommended by scientific societies for these child/young-adulthood cancer survivors in the same way as the one for high risk women because ofconstitutional mutations. Our results support these recommendations, not onlybecause of a similar cumulative risk, but also because of the aggressivehistological characteristics.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20170824 PMID: 29493262  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
