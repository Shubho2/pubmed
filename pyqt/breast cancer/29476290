Questionnaires on taste, smell, andquality of life were completed shortly after and 6 months after chemotherapy(patients) or at two moments with 6 months' time window in between (comparisons).RESULTS: Self-reported taste and smell perception were significantly lower inpatients shortly after chemotherapy compared to the comparison group. Mostpatients recovered 6 months after chemotherapy, although patients who were still receiving trastuzumab then reported a lower taste and smell perception comparedto patients who were not. A lower self-reported taste and smell werestatistically significantly associated with a worse quality of life, social,emotional, and role functioning shortly after chemotherapy. Six months afterchemotherapy, taste and smell were statistically significantly associated withquality of life, social and role functioning, but only in patients receivingtrastuzumab.CONCLUSIONS: Most taste and smell alterations recovered within 6 months after theend of chemotherapy for breast cancer, but not for patients receivingtrastuzumab. These results highlight the importance of monitoring taste and smellalterations during and after treatment with chemotherapy and trastuzumab, as theymay impact quality of life.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4720-3 PMCID: PMC5993854PMID: 29476290
