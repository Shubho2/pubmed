Weinvestigated whether higher peripheral lymphocyte counts are associated withlower breast cancer-specific mortality (BCM) and overall mortality (OM) inTNBC.Experimental Design: Data on treatments and diagnostic tests from electronicmedical records of two health care systems were linked with demographic,clinical, pathologic, and mortality data from the California Cancer Registry.Multivariable regression models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomicstatus, cancer stage, grade, neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy use, radiotherapy use, and germline BRCA1/2 mutations were used to evaluate associations betweenabsolute lymphocyte count (ALC), BCM, and OM. For a subgroup with TIL dataavailable, we explored the relationship between TILs and peripheral lymphocytecounts.Results: A total of 1,463 stage I-III TNBC patients were diagnosed from2000 to 2014; 1,113 (76%) received neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy within 1year of diagnosis. Of 759 patients with available ALC data, 481 (63.4%) were everlymphopenic (minimum ALC <1.0 K/μL). On multivariable analysis, higher minimumALC, but not absolute neutrophil count, predicted lower OM [HR = 0.23; 95%confidence interval (CI), 0.16-0.35] and BCM (HR = 0.19; CI, 0.11-0.34).Five-year probability of BCM was 15% for patients who were ever lymphopenicversus 4% for those who were not. An exploratory analysis (n = 70) showed asignificant association between TILs and higher peripheral lymphocyte countsduring neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Conclusions: Higher peripheral lymphocyte counts predicted lower mortality from early-stage, potentially curable TNBC, suggesting that immune function may enhance the effectiveness of early TNBC treatment.
