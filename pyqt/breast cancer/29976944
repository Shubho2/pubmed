[Epub ahead of print]Role of columnar cell lesions in breast carcinogenesis: analysis of chromosome 16copy number changes by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification.de Boer M(1), Verschuur-Maes AHJ(2), Buerger H(3), Moelans CB(1), SteenkamerM(4), Savola S(4), van Diest PJ(5).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan100, 3584 CX, Utrecht, The Netherlands.(2)Gelre Hospitals, Apeldoorn, The Netherlands.(3)Institute of Pathology, Paderborn, Germany.(4)MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.(5)Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan100, 3584 CX, Utrecht, The Netherlands. p.j.vandiest@umcutrecht.nl.Columnar cell lesions have been proposed as precursor lesions of low-grade breastcancer. The molecular characteristic of low-grade breast neoplasia is whole-armloss of chromosome 16q. Copy number changes of 6 genes on 16p and 20 genes on 16qwere analysed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification in 165 lesions of 103 patients. Twenty-three columnar cell lesions and 19 atypical ducalhyperplasia lesions arising in columnar cell lesions were included, as well ascases of usual ductal hyperplasia, blunt duct adenosis, ductal carcinoma in situ,lobular neoplasia and invasive carcinoma. Usual ductal hyperplasia and blunt ductadenosis lacked whole-arm losses of 16q. In contrast, columnar cell lesionswithout atypia, columnar cell lesions with atypia, atypical ductal hyperplasia,low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ and low-grade invasive carcinomas increasinglyharboured whole-arm losses of 16q (17%, 27%, 47% and 57%, respectively). However,no recurrent losses in specific genes could be identified. In several patients,columnar cell lesions and atypical ductal hyperplasia harboured similar losses asrelated ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinomas within the same breast.There were indications for 16q breakpoints near the centromere. Whole-arm gainson 16p were relatively scarce and there was no relation between whole-arm gainsof 16p and progression of lesions of the low-grade breast neoplasia family. Inconclusion, columnar cell lesions (with and without atypia) often harbourwhole-arm losses of 16q, which underlines their role as precursors in low-gradebreast carcinogenesis, in contrast with usual ductal hyperplasia and blunt ductadenosis. However, no recurrent losses in specific genes could be identified,pointing to minor events in multiple tumour suppressor genes rather than majorevents in a single 16q gene contributing to low-grade breast carcinogenesis.DOI: 10.1038/s41379-018-0099-2 PMID: 29976944
