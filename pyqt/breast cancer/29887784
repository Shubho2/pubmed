Epub 2018 Apr 20.Can Nutrition Lower the Risk of Recurrence in Breast Cancer?Weigl J(1), Hauner H(1), Hauner D(1).Author information: (1)Institute for Nutritional Medicine, Else Kr√∂ner-Fresenius-Center forNutritional Medicine, University Hospital Klinikum rechts der Isar, TechnicalUniversity of Munich, Munich, Germany.Background: The impact of diet on breast cancer prognosis is poorly understood.Therefore, we conducted a literature search summarizing the current evidence onthe effect of diet on breast cancer recurrence and mortality.Methods: The PubMed database was searched for original studies, reviews, andmeta-analyses published between 2010 and 2017. Studies related to diet, dietarypatterns, special diets or specific dietary factors, and breast cancer recurrenceor mortality were included.Results: Adherence to high diet quality indices (relative risk (RR) 0.74, 95%confidence interval (CI) 0.60-0.90) and a prudent/healthy dietary pattern (RR0.76, 95% CI 0.60-0.95) may have a beneficial effect on breast cancer prognosis, whereas a Western/unhealthy diet is associated with poorer overall mortality (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.17-1.77). For low-fat diets, the findings are inconsistent. Apositive effect of the Mediterranean Diet was found for all-cause mortality, but no beneficial effect from other diets such as low-carbohydrate, ketogenic orvegetarian/vegan diets was observed. Alcohol consumption was associated with anincreased risk for breast cancer recurrence. No general recommendation for soyexists, but occasional intake seems to be acceptable, whereas the use of othersupplements is not justified.Conclusion: Adherence to high-quality diets and a prudent/healthy dietary patternseem to be beneficial for breast cancer prognosis. No clear evidence for abenefit from special diets, soy products, or other supplements was found.DOI: 10.1159/000488718 PMCID: PMC5981678 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29887784
