We developednovel nanocarrier systems for tumour targeting and controlled CUR release andevaluated their therapeutic efficacy.EXPERIMENTS: The surface of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) was modifiedwith hyaluronan (HA) or polyethyleneimine-folic acid (PEI-FA) via disulfidebonds. The capacity of the resultant nanocarriers (MSN-HA and MSN-PEI-FA,respectively) for CUR delivery was evaluated in a breast cancer cell line and amouse xenograft model.FINDINGS: MSN/CUR-PEI-FA and MSN/CUR-HA were cytotoxic to MDA-MB-231 breastcancer cells. Both formulations showed an enhanced cellular uptake compared with that of a non-targeted nanocarrier, with a greater cellular uptake of FA-modifiednanoparticles than that of HA-modified nanoparticles. Accordingly, MSN-PEI-FAshowed more precise targeting and higher accumulation in tumours than did MSN-HA,as visualized by live imaging. Both types of nanoparticles had goodbiocompatibility and low toxicity, and MSN/CUR-PEI-FA inhibited the tumour growthto a greater degree than did free CUR. Thus, MSN/CUR-PEI-FA are a promising drug delivery system for the treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1473412 PMID: 29790797
