Distinguishingintramammary metastases from benign tumors and breast cancer is clinicallyproblematic. Some patients undergo excessive surgery after a misdiagnosis ofbreast cancer instead of a mammary tumor. We performed a core needle biopsy (CNB)of a breast mass that developed in a 71-year-old woman after surgeries forbilateral RCC and breast cancer, leading to a diagnosis of intramammarymetastasis of RCC. In this case, the CNB and immunohistochemical examination werecritical for reaching a definitive diagnosis. We conclude that, when examiningpatients with mammary tumors, establishing their history of malignant tumors may help diagnose intramammary metastasis and select the best treatment strategy.DOI: 10.1159/000489391 PMCID: PMC6006650PMID: 29928210
