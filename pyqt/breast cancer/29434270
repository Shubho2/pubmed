A number of highly relatedvirus-like DNAs have been recently isolated from bovine milk and sera and from a brain sample of a MS patient. As a genetic activity of theseAcinetobacter-related bovine milk and meat factors (BMMFs) is unknown ineukaryotes, we analyzed their expression and replication potential in humanHEK293TT cells. While all analyzed BMMFs show transcriptional activity, the MSbrain isolate MSBI1.176, sharing homology with a transmissible spongiformencephalopathy-associated DNA molecule, is transcribed at highest levels. We showexpression of a replication-associated protein (Rep), which is highly conservedamong all BMMFs, and serological tests indicate a human anti-Rep immune response.While the cow milk isolate CMI1.252 is replication-competent in HEK293TT cells,replication of MSBI1.176 is complemented by CMI1.252, pointing at an interplayduring the establishment of persistence in human cells. Transcriptome profilingupon BMMF expression identified host cellular gene expression changes related to cell cycle progression and cell viability control, indicating potential pathways for a pathogenic involvement of BMMFs.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-21317-w PMCID: PMC5809378PMID: 29434270
