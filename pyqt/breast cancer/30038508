MicroRNA-19b (miR-19b) has been described as serving a crucial rolein tumorigenesis of breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigatethe expression patterns, clinical value, and functional role of miR-19b in breastcancer.Methods: Expression of miR-19b was estimated by quantitative real time PCR.Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression assay were performed to explorethe prognostic value of miR-19b. The functional role of miR-19b was verifiedusing cell experiments.Results: Upregulated miR-19b expression was observed in breast cancer tissues andcells compared with the controls (all P<0.05). The miR-19b expression wasassociated with distant metastasis and TNM stage. The survival curves showed thathigh miR-19b was correlated with poor overall survival of the patients (log-rank P=0.002). Furthermore, miR-19b was proven to be an independent prognostic factor for patients. By using miR-19b mimic and inhibitor, cell proliferation,migration, and invasion were enhanced by miR-19b overexpression but weresuppressed by reduction of miR-19b (all P<0.05). Besides, PI3K/AKT wasdemonstrated to be activated by miR-19b in breast cancer cells.Conclusion: The overexpression of miR-19b serves as a candidate prognosticbiomarker of breast cancer and may be involved in the tumor progression throughPI3K/AKT pathway.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S171043 PMCID: PMC6052917PMID: 30038508
