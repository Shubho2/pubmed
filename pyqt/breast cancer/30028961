Formationof metastases was found to be associated with the capacity of cancer cells toquit the tumor mass and journey through the circulation to distant organs. Thiscell population is called circulating tumor cells (CTCs). They exhibit severaladvanced properties such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) anddormancy that are essential for supporting their survival in the bloodstream,radio- and chemoresistance, their escape from the anti-cancer immune response,and metastasis initiation. CTCs, and especially dormant tumor cells, areresponsible for post-surgery tumor recurrence. CTCs were detected in the blood ofpatients affected with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)-the most frequent, invasive,and deadly neoplasm among primary brain tumors. The identification ofglioblastoma CTCs might have a promising clinical potential for early tumordiagnosis and prognosis. A variety of CTC enrichment and detection techniqueshave been developed to date. For several epithelial cancers, especially forbreast carcinoma, a prognostic value of CTCs was reported. Similar efforts shouldbe performed for GBM to evaluate clinical the significance of CTCs.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2018.07.007 PMID: 30028961
