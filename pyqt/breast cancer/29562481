[Epub ahead of print]Huge mucinous carcinoma of the breast in which doubling time was observed bycomputed tomography during 3 years without treatment.Nakata B(1), Kuroda K(1), Yoshida Y(2), Iimori N(1), Masuda G(1), Lee T(1), TendoM(1), Hori T(1), Sato H(3), Ishikawa T(1).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Kashiwara City Municipal Hospital, 1-7-9 Hozenji,Kashiwara City, Osaka 582-0005, Japan.(2)Department of Dermatology, Kashiwara City Municipal Hospital, 1-7-9 Hozenji,Kashiwara City, Osaka 582-0005, Japan.(3)Department of Internal Medicine, Kashiwara City Municipal Hospital, 1-7-9Hozenji, Kashiwara City, Osaka 582-0005, Japan.Here we report the case of a 77-year-old woman with a huge cancer of the rightbreast for which size was measured on computed tomography in our hospitalpreoperatively and in other hospital 3 years earlier. During the 3-year untreatedinterval, the tumor grew from 4 cm to 13 cm in maximum diameter, and thetumor-volume doubling time (TVDT) was calculated as 209 days. The patientunderwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection, with the large skindefect covered by autologous skin graft. The pathological diagnosis was puremucinous carcinoma (MC) of the breast with a low MIB-1 index, no vessel invasion,and no lymph node metastasis. Breast MC has been known to show a slow growthrate, but the TVDT of this current tumor was not markedly different from that of common breast cancers described in previous reports. This short TVDTnotwithstanding the low aggressiveness may be due to abundant mucin occupying themajority of the tumor volume. To the best of our knowledge, no previous reportshave provided accurate TVDTs for breast MC.DOI: 10.3233/BD-170300 PMID: 29562481
