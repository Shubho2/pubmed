The aim of the study was to assess the respective marker gene expression in patients treated with radical cystectomy formuscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and to evaluate the applicability of breastcancer subtypes for MIBC risk stratification.MATERIALS & METHODS: 102 patients treated with radical cystectomy for MIBC wereassessed. Using routine FFPE tissue and an IVD validated kit, mRNA expression wasmeasured by single step RT-qPCR. Partition test were employed to define cut-offvalues for high or low marker gene expression. Association of expression withoutcome was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate cox regression analysis. Finally, we performed validation of our results in the MD-Andersoncohort (n=57).RESULTS: Cancer specific survival (CSS) was impaired in patients with high geneexpression of Her2 (P=0.0009) and ESR1 (P=0.04). In the multivariate regressionmodel Her2 expression remained significant for the prediction of CSS (HR=2.11, CI1.11-4.21, P=0.024). Furthermore, molecular stratification by breast cancersubgroups was significant (P=0.023) for CSS prediction. Especially thedifferentiation between Her2-positive and Luminal A (HR=4.41, CI 1.53-18.71,P=0.004) and Luminal B (HR=1.96, CI 0.99-4.08, P=0.053) respectively was anindependent prognostic parameter for CSS. External validation resulted incomparable risk stratification with differences in fractional subgroupsdistribution.CONCLUSION: Gene expression of Her2, ESR1, PGR, Ki67 and corresponding breastcancer subtypes allow a risk-stratification in MIBC, whereby Her2 overexpressing tumors reveal a particularly poor prognosis.Copyright © 2017.
