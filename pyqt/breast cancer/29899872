Ponatinibblocks a variety of tyrosine kinases including ABL and fibroblast growth factorreceptor (FGFR), and the BET bromodomain (BRD) antagonists JQ1 and dBET1 impedeMYC oncogene expression. Both drugs have demonstrated substantial anti-cancerefficacy against several hematological malignancies. Solid tumors, on the otherhand, although frequently driven by FGFR and/or MYC, are often unresponsive tothese drugs. This is due, at least in part, to compensatory feedback-loops in thekinome and transcription network of these tumors, which are activated in responseto drug exposure. Therefore, we hypothesized that the combination of themulti-kinase inhibitor ponatinib with transcription modulators such as JQ1 ordBET1 might overcome this therapeutic recalcitrance. Using 3H-thymidine uptake,cell cycle analysis, and caspase-3 or Annexin V labeling, we demonstrate thatsingle drugs induce moderate dose-dependent growth-inhibition and/or apoptosis incolon (HCT116, HT29), breast (MCF-7, SKBR3) and ovarian (A2780, SKOV3) cancercells. Ponatinib elicited primarily apoptosis, while JQ1 and dBET1 caused G0/G1cell cycle arrest and very mild cell death. Phospho-FGFR and MYC, major targetsof ponatinib and BET inhibitors, were downregulated after treatment with singledrugs. Remarkably, ponatinib was found to sensitize cells to BET antagonists byenhancing apoptotic cell death, and this effect was associated withdownregulation of MYC. In summary, our data shows that ponatinib sensitizescolon, breast, and ovarian cancer cells to BET bromodomain inhibitors. Furtherstudies are warranted to determine the clinical value of this phenomenon.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25474 PMCID: PMC5995173PMID: 29899872
