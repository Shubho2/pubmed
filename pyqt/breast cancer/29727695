Electronic address: ark@korea.ac.kr.The definition of multifocal breast cancer is ambiguous, and its incidence variesdepending on the definition and detection methods. Multifocal breast cancerseither have the same clonal origin or arise from completely distinct progenitorcells. The current American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging system and College of American Pathologists breast tumor guidelines state that only the largesttumor needs to be staged and studied immunohistochemically, on the assumptionthat they are of the same origin. However, some multifocal tumors have beenproved to have arisen from different clones. In the present study, 71 cases ofsurgically resected multifocal breast cancers were selected. To detect andcharacterize the tumors of each clonal origin, a human androgen receptor gene(HUMARA) assay to compare the X-chromosome inactivation patterns of multipletumors was conducted. Twenty-nine of 71 (40.8%) patients were revealed to beheterozygous for HUMARA. Sixty-four (90.1%) patients had the same X chromosomeinactivated in different tumors. Seven (9.9%) cases had different inactivated Xchromosomes between multifocal tumors, indicating that those tumors were fromseparate progenitor cells. Five (7.0%) cases showed identical histologic featuresbut had different inactivated HUMARA alleles. According to these results, 2separate tumors might be synchronous primary tumors, although theirhistopathologic characteristics are similar. Furthermore, multifocal tumors canbe of different origins despite being closely located to each other. Thesefindings suggest that separate grouping of multiple breast tumors based on their clonal origin is needed for future studies.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
