The maximum, mean, median, minimum, and standarddeviation of shear wave speed (SWS) values (m/s) were assessed. The elasticityscore, a new qualitative feature, was evaluated in the travel time map. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves were plotted toevaluate the diagnostic performance of both qualitative and quantitative analysesfor differentiation of breast lesions.RESULTS: Among all quantitative parameters, SWS-max showed the highest AUROC(0.805; 95% CI: 0.752, 0.851) compared with SWS-mean (0.786; 95% CI:0.732, 0.834;P = 0.094), SWS-median (0.775; 95% CI:0.720, 0.824; P = 0.046), SWS-min (0.675;95% CI:0.615, 0.731; P = 0.000), and SWS-SD (0.768; 95% CI:0.712, 0.817;P = 0.074). The AUROC of qualitative analysis in this study obtained the bestdiagnostic performance (0.871; 95% CI: 0.825, 0.909, compared with the bestparameter of SWS-max in quantitative analysis, P = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS: The new qualitative analysis of shear wave travel time showed thesuperior diagnostic performance in the differentiation of breast lesions incomparison with conventional quantitative analysis.DOI: 10.3233/CH-170334 PMID: 29660908  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
