We analyzed use of the 21-gene expressionassay, changes in frequency of adjuvant chemotherapy use, and clinicopathologicalfactors related to adjuvant chemotherapy to assess the impact of the 21-geneexpression assay.RESULTS: Adjuvant chemotherapy use declined from 33.33% (2011) to 13.59% (2015)[relative risk (RR), 0.71; 95% CI 0.56-0.89; ptrend = 0.004] in patients with21-gene expression assay data. Among patients without assay data, adjuvantchemotherapy use decreased from 76.79 to 40.17% between 2010 and 2015 (RR 0.87;95% CI 0.84-0.91; ptrend < 0.001), especially for patients withnode-negative/micrometastasis (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.81-0.89; ptrend < 0.001). Thefrequency of adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly decreased after introductionof the 21-gene expression assay (p < 0.001). Tumor size (p < 0.001), progesteronereceptor (PgR) status (p = 0.001), and proliferation index (Ki-67) levels(p < 0.001) were important factors for chemotherapy decision-making innode-negative/micrometastasis patients who did not undergo the assay.CONCLUSIONS: For HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients with 0-1 node metastases, chemotherapy use declined significantly after the adoption of the21-gene assay. PgR status and Ki-67 were useful for chemotherapy decision-making in cases without the 21-gene assay.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4740-z PMID: 29516374
