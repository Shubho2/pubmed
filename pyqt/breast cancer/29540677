However, the mechanism by which the biological function of FOXK2 is regulated remains poorlyunderstood. Here, we investigated the role of SUMOylation in modulatingFOXK2-mediated drug sensitivity. We identified SUMOylation consensus motifswithin the FOXK2 sequence and constructed two SUMOylation-defective doublemutants by converting lysine 527 and 633 to arginines and glutamic acid 529 and635 to alanines, respectively. We found that both the FOXK2 SUMOylation-deficient(K527/633 R) and (E529/635 A) mutants were ineffective in mediating the cytotoxicfunction of paclitaxel when compared to the wild-type (WT) FOXK2. Whenoverexpressed, unlike the wild-type (WT) FOXK2, the K527/633 R mutant had little effect on the sensitivity of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells to paclitaxel, asexamined by cell viability and clonogenic assays. Our results also showed thatMCF-7 cells overexpressing the K527/633 R mutant form of FOXK2 or the emptyexpression vector have lower protein and mRNA levels of its tumour suppressivetranscriptional target FOXO3 compared to the wild-type FOXK2. Consistently, ChIP assays revealed that unlike wild-type FOXK2, the SUMOylation-defective(K527/633 R) mutant is unable to bind to the FOXO3 promoter, despite expressingcomparable levels of protein and having the same subcellular localization as the wild-type FOXK2 in MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, expression of neither thewild-type nor the K527/633 R mutant FOXK2 had any effect on the proliferation andpaclitaxel sensitivity of the MCF-7 TaxR paclitaxel-resistant cells. Inagreement, both the wild-type and the (K527/633 R) mutant FOXK2 failed to bind tothe endogenous FOXO3 promoter in these cells. Collectively, our results suggestthat SUMOylation positively regulates FOXK2 transcriptional activity and has arole in mediating the cytotoxic response to paclitaxel through the tumoursuppressor FOXO3.DOI: 10.1038/s41389-018-0038-6 PMCID: PMC5852961PMID: 29540677
