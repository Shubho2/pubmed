The aimof this study was to estimate complication rates and RT-specific and 1-year costsfor a cohort of female Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with breast cancer (N =47 969). We analyzed 2005-2007 Medicare claims using multivariable logisticregression for complications and generalized linear models (log link, gammadistribution) for costs. Overall, 11% (n = 5296) underwent brachytherapy-basedRT; 9.4% had complications. Odds of any complication were higher (odds ratio[OR]: 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.49-1.76) for brachytherapy versuswhole breast RT, similarly to seroma (OR: 2.85; 95% CI: 1.97-4.13), woundcomplication/infection (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.52-1.95), cellulitis (OR: 1.48; 95%CI: 1.27-1.73), and necrosis (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.55-2.75). Mean RT-specific and 1-year total costs for whole breast RT were $6375, and $19 917, $4886, and $4803 lower than brachytherapy ( P < .0001). Multivariable analyses indicatedbrachytherapy yielded 76% higher RT costs (risk ratio: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.74-1.78, P< .0001) compared with whole breast RT. Brachytherapy had higher complicationsand costs before long-term evidence proved its effectiveness. Policies shouldrequire treatment registries with reimbursement incentives to capturesurveillance data for new technologies.DOI: 10.1177/0046958018759115 PMCID: PMC5846914PMID: 29502466
