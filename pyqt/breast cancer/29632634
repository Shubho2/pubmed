Some physicians might not considerelderly patients (>65 years) for NACT due to poor prognosis or higher toxicity.The aim of this analysis is to help selecting appropriately elderly women whowould benefit from NACT. Secondly, survival parameters are investigated inseveral histological subgroups.Methods: From 1998 to 2010, eight prospectively randomized German Breast Group(GBG) trials of anthracycline- and taxane-based NACT were performed and analyzed in this study.Results: Compared to the overall average, elderly women had significant largertumors and more overall lymph node involvement. Histologically, they had more G2 tumors, more estrogen-receptor positive tumors. pCR (ypT0 ypN0) was stronglyassociated with age. The multivariable logistic regression analysis of clinicalparameters showed that young age, clinical stage T4, invasive ductal cancer andpoor differentiated breast cancer are predictive for high pCR. The multivariateanalyses of molecular subgroups showed that age >65years is a predictor ofsignificant lower pCR in HER2- breast cancers. Nonetheless, HER2+ patients showedpCR rates as high- and HR+/HER2+ even higher - pCR rates compared to youngerpatients.Discussion: This study underlines the unfavorable impact of higher age on pCR,but it shows a realistic chance for pCR if NACT is applied - especially for HER2+patients. Furthermore, elderly patients with non-TNBC showed a good prognosis(comparable to younger patients) regarding overall survival, even if they do not have pCR.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24586 PMCID: PMC5880594PMID: 29632634
