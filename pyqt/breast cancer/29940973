Thissurvey determines the practices and knowledge among Chinese female OB/GYNsregarding modern contraceptive methods.METHODS: A multicenter questionnaire was completed by 2000 female OB/GYNsparticipating in training courses organized by the gynecological endocrinologytraining committee of the Chinese Medical Doctor Association from February to May2013.RESULTS: This survey achieved a response rate of 51.4%. The rate of inducedabortion among this group was 56.3%; this may be attributable to unreliablecontraceptive methods (55.5%) and failure of reliable contraceptive methods(18.9%). Intrauterine devices (IUDs) were more commonly used by parous women thannulliparous women (42.6% vs 1.7%; p < 0.0001), followed by condom and rhythmmethod (24.2% vs 20.8%). However, nulliparous women commonly used rhythm method(48.3% vs 3.3%; p < 0.0001) and condoms (19.2% vs 10.5%; p = 0.008). OB/GYNsdemonstrated misconceptions of OB/GYNs about COCs, such as the risk of breastcancer, amenorrhea and premature ovarian failure, and decreased fertility asreported by 37.10, 10.6, and 7.5% of the respondents, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: IUDs were commonly used by parous Chinese OB/GYNs. Unreliablecontraceptive methods and misconceptions about the side effects of COCs mayresult in the high rate of unintended pregnancies. Hence, awareness of safe andeffective contraceptive methods should be strengthened among OB/GYNs in China.DOI: 10.1186/s12978-018-0557-9 PMCID: PMC6019505PMID: 29940973
