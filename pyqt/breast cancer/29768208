Electronic address:sven.rottenberg@vetsuisse.unibe.ch.Selective elimination of BRCA1-deficient cells by inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a prime example of the concept of synthetic lethality incancer therapy. This interaction is counteracted by the restoration ofBRCA1-independent homologous recombination through loss of factors such as 53BP1,RIF1, and REV7/MAD2L2, which inhibit end resection of DNA double-strand breaks(DSBs). To identify additional factors involved in this process, we performedCRISPR/SpCas9-based loss-of-function screens and selected for factors that conferPARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance in BRCA1-deficient cells. Loss of members ofthe CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complex were found to cause PARPi resistance inBRCA1-deficient cells in vitro and in vivo. We show that CTC1 depletion resultsin the restoration of end resection and that the CST complex may act downstreamof 53BP1/RIF1. These data suggest that, in addition to its role in protectingtelomeres, the CST complex also contributes to protecting DSBs from endresection.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).
