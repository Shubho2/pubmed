The present study aimed at assessing the effectiveness oftrastuzumab adjuvant therapy in early stage BC in overall survival (OS) anddisease-free survival (DFS). Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis wasperformed to evaluate the effectiveness of trastuzumab adjuvant therapy. PubMed, Cochrane library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched for relevant RCTs from the beginning to February 2017. Quality assessment of studies was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The desired outcomes were OS and DFS. Results: A total of 1818 articles were identified first, however, only11 studies were eligible to be included in this study. Our findings andmeta-analysis results revealed that trastuzumab is effective in increasing OS (OShazard ratio: -0.286 ± 0.049, 95%CI (-0.381, - 0.191)) and improving DFS (DFShazard ratio: -0.419± 0.077, 95%CI (-0.569, -0.269)). The most serious butnegligible side effect of trastuzumab is congestive heart failure. Conclusion:Adding trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy in early stages of BC in HER2 positivepatients could increase OS and DFS of the patients effectively.DOI: 10.14196/mjiri.31.88 PMCID: PMC6014767PMID: 29951389
