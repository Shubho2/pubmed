Thecytotoxicity of these compounds were evaluated against five human cancer celllines (colorectal cancer cell: HCT-15, breast cancer cell: MDA-MB-231, livercancer cell: BEL-7402, colorectal cancer cell: HCT-116 and ovarian cancer cell:A2780) in vitro. Among them, compound 14 was found to be the most potentcytotoxic compound against three cell lines (MDA-MB-231, BEL-7402 and A2780) withIC50 values of 0.66±0.05, 5.11±0.12 and 8.26±0.22 µM, respectively. Additionally,the length of the side chains and the position of the substituent may also affectthe cytotoxic activity of the naphthoquinone oxime derivatives. In general,compound 14 effectively inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and may becomea promising anticancer agent.DOI: 10.1248/cpb.c18-00013 PMID: 29863062  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
