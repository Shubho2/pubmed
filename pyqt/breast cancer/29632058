DCIS survivors may face excess risk of second breast events (SBEs). However, little is known about SBE treatmentor its relationship to initial DCIS care. Methods: Among a prospective cohort of women who underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for DCIS from 1997 to 2008 atinstitutions participating in the NCCN Outcomes Database, we identified SBEs,described patterns of care for SBEs, and examined the association between DCIStreatment choice and SBE care. Using multivariable regression, we identifiedfeatures associated with use of mastectomy, radiation therapy (RT), orantiestrogen therapy (AET) for SBEs. Results: Of 2,939 women who underwent BCSfor DCIS, 83% received RT and 40% received AET. During the median follow-up of4.2 years, 200 women (6.8%) developed an SBE (55% ipsilateral, 45% invasive).SBEs occurred in 6% of women who underwent RT for their initial DCIS versus 11%who did not. Local treatment for these events included BCS (10%), BCS/RT (30%),mastectomy (53%), or none (6%); only 28% of patients received AET. Independentpredictors of RT or mastectomy for SBEs included younger age, shorter time to SBEdiagnosis, and RT or AET for the initial DCIS. Conclusions: A sizable proportion of patients with SBEs were treated with mastectomy, most especially those whopreviously received RT for their initial DCIS and those who developed anipsilateral SBE. Despite the occurrence of an SBE, relatively few patientsreceived AET. Future studies should investigate optimal treatment approaches for SBEs, including the benefit of mastectomy versus lumpectomy for an ipsilateralSBE and the benefit of AET for a hormone-receptor-positive SBE contingent on AET use for the initial DCIS diagnosis.Copyright Â© 2018 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.DOI: 10.6004/jnccn.2018.7003 PMID: 29632058
