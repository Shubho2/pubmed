TAFis a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein(BCRP) transporters. Disposition of TAF may be altered by comedications that can inhibit or induce P-gp or BCRP transporters. The effects of ARVs on thepharmacokinetics of TAF were evaluated in 3 studies.METHODS: Healthy participants received TAF administered alone or with rilpivirinein study 1, with dolutegravir, ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV + RTV),lopinavir (LPV/RTV), or darunavir (DRV + RTV) in study 2, and with thepharmacokinetic enhancer cobicistat or efavirenz in study 3.RESULTS: Across the 3 studies, 98 participants received treatment with TAF and a coadministered agent (n = 10-34/cohort). All study treatments were welltolerated. TAF and TFV exposures were unaffected after co-administration withrilpivirine and dolutegravir. Coadministration with P-gp/BCRP inhibitors such as cobicistat or PI-based regimens (ATV + RTV, LPV/r, or DRV + RTV) resulted in arange of 6%-183% increases in TAF and 105%-316% increases in TFV exposure,whereas coadministration with a P-gp inducer, efavirenz, resulted in a 15%-24%decrease in TAF and TFV exposure.CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of the drug interaction between TAF and other commonlyprescribed boosted and unboosted ARVs provides characterization of thesusceptibility of TAF and/or TFV pharmacokinetics to inhibitors or inducers ofP-gp/BCRP transporters.DOI: 10.1097/QAI.0000000000001699 PMID: 29649076
