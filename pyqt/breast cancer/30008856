China.Breast cancer is one of the most common female malignancies in clinical practice,which ranks number one in terms of its high incidence. We investigated therelevance of ultrasonic features of breast cancer and expression levels ofC-erbB-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nm23 and its clinicalsignificance. A total of 76 patients with breast cancer were recruited who wereadmitted to The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from January, 2016 toAugust, 2017. All patients underwent color Doppler ultrasonic imaging, andexpression levels of C-erbB-2, VEGF and nm23 in their tumor tissues were measuredby immunohistochemistry. The ultrasonic features were evaluated and compared withthe expression levels of C-erbB-2, VEGF and nm23 for each patient.Ultrasonography showed a tumor mass with spiculated margins, abnormalvasculature, and a diameter no less than 3 cm, as well as lymph node metastasis. The above signs were associated with high expression of C-erbB-2, VEGF and nm23(p<0.05), but calcification was not associated with high expression of thesebiomarkers (p>0.05). For patients with highly expressed C-erbB-2 and VEGF, thetime to peak (TTP) of the time-intensity curve obtained by contrast enhancedultrasound was shorter, while the peak intensity (PI) was higher. On thecontrary, for patients with highly expressed nm23, the TTP was apparently longer,while the PI was lower (p<0.05). The ultrasonic features of breast cancer wererelevant to the expression levels of C-erbB-2, VEGF and nm23. Thus, theexpression levels of C-erbB-2, VEGF and nm23 were predictable indirectlyaccording to the ultrasonic features of the patient, which can be used as areference for breast cancer treatment and prognosis prediction.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8777 PMCID: PMC6036493PMID: 30008856
