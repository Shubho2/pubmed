a sarcomatous component on the tumorcharacteristics and clinical outcomes of women with uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS).METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a prior multicenter retrospective studythat examined women with stage I-IV UCS who underwent primary hysterectomy.Archived histopathology slides were reviewed and LVSI was scored as follows: LVSIwith a carcinomatous component alone (LVSI-carcinoma; n = 375, 76.8%) or LVSIcontaining a sarcomatous component with or without a carcinomatous component(LVSI-sarcoma; n = 113, 23.2%). Qualitative metrics of LVSI were correlated toclinicopathological factors and survival outcome.RESULTS: Tumors in the LVSI-sarcoma group were more likely to have sarcomadominance (82.1 vs. 26.4%) heterologous sarcomatous component (51.3 vs. 37.9%),low-grade carcinoma (42.5 vs. 22.4%), and large tumor size (81.0 vs. 70.2%) inthe primary tumor site compared with tumors in the LVSI-carcinoma group (allp < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, LVSI-sarcoma was independently associatedwith decreased progression-free survival (5-year rates: 34.9 vs. 40.8%, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-2.50, p < 0.001), andcause-specific survival (5-year rates: 41.8 vs. 55.9%, adjusted HR 1.95, 95% CI1.39-2.75, p < 0.001) compared with LVSI-carcinoma. Postoperative radiotherapyfor women with LVSI-sarcoma had a higher reduction rate of recurrence/progressionof disease (54% reduction, p = 0.04) compared with postoperative radiotherapy forwomen with LVSI-carcinoma (26% reduction, p = 0.08).CONCLUSION: In UCS, the presence of a sarcomatous component in LVSI isparticularly prevalent when a tumor has sarcoma dominance. Our study suggeststhat LVSI containing a sarcomatous component may be a predictor of decreasedsurvival for women with UCS.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6547-x PMID: 29971677
