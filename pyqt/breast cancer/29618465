However, the current evidence inobservational studies is inconclusive. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of metformin on the incidence of breast cancer andall-cause mortality in patients with type II diabetes (T2D).Methods: A literaturesearch was performed on Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library from inception to November 2016. Outcomes were incidence of breast cancer and all-causemortality. Risk of bias and overall certainty of evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development,and Evaluation (GRADE), respectively. Meta-analyses were performed using the mostfully adjusted ORs or HRs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) as effectmeasures.Results: A total of 12 observational studies were included for breastcancer incidence and 11 studies for all-cause mortality. No significantassociation was found between metformin exposure and incidence of breast cancer(OR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.85-1.03; I2 = 35%). A 45% risk reduction was observed forall-cause mortality (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.44-0.70; I2 = 81%). Presence ofpublication bias is strongly suspected for both outcomes using Egger's funnelplots.Conclusions: The use of metformin may improve overall survival in patients with T2D and breast cancer. No effect of metformin on the incidence of breastcancer was observed. Interpretation of results is limited by the observationalnature of the studies and resulting biases.Impact: Clinical trials are warranted to determine the role of metformin in breast cancer risk reduction and prognosis.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 27(6); 627-35. ©2018 AACR.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-17-0936 PMID: 29618465
