However, conventionalphotodynamic therapy actually has two main constraints: the limited penetrationdepth of visible light needed for its activation, and the lack of selectivity.Considering this, this work reports the synthesis and evaluation of a novelnanoconjugate for imaging and selective photodynamic therapy againstHER2-positive breast cancer, a particularly aggressive form of the disease. Itwas demonstrated that upon 975 nm near infrared light exposure, the red emission of the NaYF4:Yb,Er up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) can be used for opticalimaging and simultaneously represent the source for the excitation of acovalently bound zinc tetracarboxyphenoxy phthalocyanine (ZnPc), aphotosensitizer that in turn transfers energy to ground state molecular oxygen toproduce cytotoxic singlet oxygen. The specificity of our nanoconjugates wasachieved by immunoconjugation with Trastuzumab (Tras), a specific monoclonalantibody for selective detection and treatment of HER2-overexpressing malignantbreast cancer cells. Selective tracking of SKBR-3 HER2-positive cells wasverified by confocal microscopy analysis, and the photodynamic therapy effect wasconsiderably improved when Trastuzumab was incorporated into the nanoconjugate,the UCNPs-ZnPc-Tras being practically inert in the absence of infrared lightexposure but reducing the HER2-positive cell viability up to 21% upon 5 min ofthe irradiation. This theranostic nanoconjugate represents a valuable alternativefor HER2-positive breast cancer imaging and selective photodynamic therapy.DOI: 10.1039/c8nr01512k PMID: 29785440
