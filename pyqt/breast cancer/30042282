A 58-year-old woman was diagnosedwith metastatic breast cancer 2 years earlier. She was treated with variouschemotherapy regimens and hormonal therapy, before being switched to fulvestrant 3 months earlier. She presented with severe anemia, and was diagnosed with MHAwith bone marrow carcinomatosis following bone marrow biopsy. She was treatedwith weekly paclitaxel and recovered successfully. A subsequent biopsy showedthat the bone marrow carcinomatosis had decreased. MHA due to breast cancer israre and is associated with poor prognosis; however, rapid initiation ofchemotherapy may be effective.PMID: 30042282
