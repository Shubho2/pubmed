Thetropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) family of tyrosine receptor kinases is emergingas an important target for cancer therapeutics. The TRK family contains threemembers, TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, and these proteins are encoded by the genes NTRK1,NTRK2, and NTRK3, respectively. To activate TRK receptors, neurotrophins bind to the extracellular region stimulating dimerization, phosphorylation, andactivation of downstream signaling pathways. Major known downstream pathwaysinclude RAS/MAPK/ERK, PLC&gamma;, and PI3K/Akt. While being rare in most cancers,TRK fusions with other proteins have been well-established as oncogenic events inspecific malignancies, including glioblastoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, andsecretory breast carcinomas. TRK protein amplification as well as alternativesplicing events have also been described as contributors to cancer pathogenesis. For patients harboring alterations in TRK expression or activity, TRK inhibition emerges as an important therapeutic target. To date, multiple trials testingTRK-inhibiting compounds in various cancers are underway. In this review, we willsummarize the current therapeutic trials for neoplasms involving NTKR genealterations, as well as the promises and setbacks that are associated withtargeting gene fusions.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10040105 PMCID: PMC5923360PMID: 29617282
