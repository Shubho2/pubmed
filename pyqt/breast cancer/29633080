In this study, the methylation levels of 22 genes that are mostlycorrelated to breast cancer were determined using EpiTect methyl II PCR array.This analysis was performed to determine the effect of cells' passage number and the use of antibiotics in the culturing media on gene methylation levels in MCF7 cell line. DNA methylation levels of PTGS2, ADAM23, HIC1, and PYCARD were foundto be significantly different among different passages. While the DNA methylationlevels of CCNA1, RASSF1, and THBS1 were found to be affected by the use of 1% of penicillin/streptomycin in the culture media. Gene expression analysis afterdemethylation using 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine showed that the gene expression levelsof the hypermethylated genes varied between different passage numbers. This studyshows that the presence of antibiotic within cultured media and cell line'spassage number could greatly affect the methylation levels that need to beconsidered in future studies on cell lines.DOI: 10.1007/s11626-018-0245-7 PMID: 29633080
