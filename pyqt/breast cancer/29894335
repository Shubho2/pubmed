Systematic studies exploringPSMA uptake in thyroid tumors are lacking. The aim of this pilot study was toassess PSMA expression in patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (mDTC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients of mDTC harboring 32 lesions (5 men; agerange, 38-65 years; mean age, 50 years) underwent prospective evaluation withradioiodine (I), F-FDG PET, and Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET scans as per the institution protocol. PSMA expression (SUVmax) was compared with F-FDG and I scan findings inall patients.RESULTS: Lesions were radioiodine avid in 8 patients, whereas 2 were classifiedas thyroglobulin elevation with negative iodide scintigraphy (TENIS) patients.All patients with iodine-avid metastatic disease showed substantial PSMA uptake. PSMA PET detected 30/32 total lesions (93.75%; SUVmax ranging from 4.86 to 101.81with median SUVmax of 31.35), whereas FDG PET/CT was positive in 23/32 lesions(81.85%). Twenty-one (70%) of 30 lesions that showed PSMA expression werelocalized to the bones. PSMA localized a lesion in each of the 2 TENIS patientssimilar to FDG PET scan.CONCLUSIONS: Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT is a potentially useful imaging modality inpatients of mDTC with most (70%) of PSMA expressing metastasis being localized tothe bones. PSMA PET/CT could be useful for identifying patients with limitedtherapeutic options (eg, TENIS) who might benefit from PSMA-targeted radionuclidetherapy.DOI: 10.1097/RLU.0000000000002161 PMID: 29894335
