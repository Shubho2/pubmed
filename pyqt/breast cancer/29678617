We addressed this gap through an onlinesurvey of 2000 screen-eligible women from Ontario, Canada in January 2016.Likert-scaled and categorical questions were used to collect information aboutscreening practices, knowledge of benefits and risks of screening and underlying attitudes and values toward screening. Results for all responses were summarized using descriptive statistics. Comparison of results between ever screened versus never screened respondents was performed using chi-squared tests. Most women feltinformed about screening yet had doubts about how informed their decisions were. They were more confident in their knowledge of the benefits than the risks which aligned with the emphasis given to benefits in discussions with health careproviders. The benefits of screening were linked with lowered anxiety aboutbreast cancer. The never screened were less likely to overstate the benefits ofscreening, more likely to give weight to the risks, and less likely to reportanxiety or worry about breast cancer. Findings highlight the need for improvedcommunication strategies and decision supports that emphasize the provision ofcurrent, balanced information about the benefits and risks of screening, both at the population-level (through mass media) and within patient-providerinteractions. Sensitivity to the psychosocial factors that shape women'sattitudes toward mammography screening should be central to any strategy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
