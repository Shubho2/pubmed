This studyexplores the determinants of employment and suboptimal workability. And evaluate the association between workability and patient-reported physical, psychological,and social outcomes.METHODS: In a hospital-based cross-sectional study, 327 breast cancer survivors, < 65 years of age and > 1 year post-diagnosis were recruited. Employed survivors filled out the workability index, which measures a person's capacity to meet workdemands in relation to current health status. The EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-BR23, hospital anxiety and depression scale, multidimensional fatigue inventory, andbrief pain index were administered. Fisher's exact test and Kruskal-Wallis testwere used to test for associations of workability and employment status withdemographic, clinical characteristics, and patient-reported outcomes. Linearmodels with standardised scores for patient-reported outcomes were fitted tostudy the associations of workability with patient-reported outcomes.RESULTS: Of the 327 survivors, < 65 years of age (working age), 140 (43%) were infull-time and 34 (10%) in part-time employment. Employed survivors were youngerat time of diagnosis and at time of survey. Employment status was not associated with time since diagnosis, ethnicity, or clinical characteristics. Suboptimalworkability was present in 37% of employed survivors of the working age, and morecommon in jobs that include physical work activities. Higher level of depression,financial difficulty and physical fatigue, more breast symptoms, and poorerglobal health status were independently associated with poorer workability.CONCLUSIONS: Lower employment and reduced workability in breast cancer survivors is common, and reduced workability is associated with higher levels ofdepression, financial difficulty and physical fatigue, more breast symptoms, and poorer global health status. Longitudinal research on psychosocial support withworkability in Asia may find tailored approach to improve or maintain workabilityin employed breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4132-2 PMID: 29511953
