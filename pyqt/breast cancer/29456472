In December 2011, the firstpregnant breast cancer patient underwent BCS and ELIOT (21 Gy at 90% isodose)during the 15th week of gestation.Results: The mean dose to the subdiaphragmatic external region in the 5non-pregnant patients was 5.57 mGy, while pelvic measurements were below 1 mGy.The actual dosimetry of the pregnant patient showed a mean subdiaphragmatic dose of 4.34 mGy, a mean suprapubic dose of 1.64 mGy, and mean ovarian doses of 1.48mGy (right-sided) and 1.44 mGy (left-sided). The expected dose to the fetus wasestimated as 0.84 mGy (0.004% of the prescribed dose).Conclusion: ELIOT as an anticipated boost to the breast could be considered inpregnant women in the early second trimester, postponing whole-breast irradiationafter delivery.DOI: 10.1159/000479862 PMCID: PMC5803713 [Available on 2018-12-01]PMID: 29456472
