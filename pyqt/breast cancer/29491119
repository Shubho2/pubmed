The annual BC-IRs were17.7, 156.9, 213.3 and 232.9/105 inhabitants for women diagnosed at <40, 40-49,50-64 and ≥65 years of age. This IR increased overall (by 4.113%/year) and forthe four age groups (by 5.935, 3.833, 4.114 and 2.194%/year, respectively). Inpatients with locoregional and metastatic disease, the IRs were 93.6 and 7.4/105 inhabitants, increasing by 6.976 and 0.303%/year, respectively. Severalspatiotemporal clusters and two spatial-variations in temporal trends weredetected. The Lisbon region showed high IR clusters for most groups.CONCLUSION: This study identified critical areas of high IR and increasing trendsfor female BC-IR, providing evidence of heterogeneities in this area.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12418 PMID: 29491119  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
