Like inclassic cirrhosis, portal hypertension is common in patients with this condition.The mechanism of pseudocirrhosis is unknown to date. We report three cases ofpseudocirrhosis arising in the setting of regression of breast cancer livermetastases. All the cases underwent systemic chemotherapy, and all had remarkableresponses. Their hormone receptor statuses were all positive and Her2/neustatuses were all negative. They were all treated with cytotoxic chemotherapeuticagent and also hormone therapy. This report suggests clinicians should havepseudocirrhosis in mind when hormone therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy arejointly administered.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0865-5 PMID: 29696562
