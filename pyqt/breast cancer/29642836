Twonumerical experiments are used to evaluate the performance of the proposedtechnique against nine existing techniques, including the t-test and theKruskal-Wallis test. Artificially generated data with outliers reveal that theproposed method results in a lower misclassification error rate and a greaterarea under the receiver operating characteristic curve compared with existingmethods. An experimentally measured breast cancer dataset to which outliers were artificially added reveals that our proposed method produces only twonon-overlapping differential metabolites whereas the other nine methods produced between seven and 57 non-overlapping differential metabolites.CONCLUSION: Our data analyses show that the performance of the proposeddifferential metabolite identification technique is better than that of existing methods. Thus, the proposed method can contribute to analysis of metabolomicsdata with outliers.
