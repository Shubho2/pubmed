This study evaluated thehealth benefits of an expressive writing intervention among breast cancerpatients in mainland China.METHODS: Stage I-III Chinese breast cancer survivors undergoing chemotherapy wererecruited in Shanghai, China. They (n = 90) were randomly assigned to one ofthree conditions: a positive thinking group (PTC) to write about the positiveaspects of their cancer experience; a self-regulation condition (SRC) to writeabout their stress and coping efforts, deepest feelings, and positive aspects of their cancer experience; or a cancer-fact group (CFC) to write about factsrelevant to their cancer experience. All groups wrote for 30 min every week for4 weeks. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed using the FACT-B at baseline and 1-and 2-month follow-ups. Linear mixed effects models were used to test thehypotheses that the SRC and PTC would improve QOL compared to the CFC.RESULTS: QOL improved overtime in the whole sample. Contrary to hypotheses, theCFC had increased QOL compared with the SRC from baseline to both the 1- and2-month follow-ups (ΔQOL = 9.31, p = 0.01, d = 0.44; ΔQOL = 9.45, p = 0.025,d = 0.49). The PTC did not differ from cancer-fact writing but had increased QOL compared with the SRC from baseline to both the 1- and 2-month follow-ups(ΔQOL = 7.44, p = 0.04, d = 0.35; ΔQOL = 11.72, p = 0.06, d = 0.61).CONCLUSION: Interventions through expressive writing about positive experienceand cancer facts are feasible and can benefit Chinese cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4308-9 PMID: 29915994
