Electronic address:shashi.gujar@dal.ca.Reticulon-4 (RTN4), commonly known as a neurite outgrowth inhibitor (Nogo), isemerging as an important player in human cancers. Clinically, we found lower RTN4expression in patient-derived tumors was associated with significantly bettersurvival in lung, breast, cervical, and renal cancer patients. To identify therole of RTN4 in cancer biology, we performed mass spectrometry-based quantitativeproteomic analysis on cancer cells following RTN4 knockdown and found its linkwith pro-survival as well as cytoskeleton-related processes. Subsequentmechanistic investigations revealed that RTN4 regulates lipid homeostasis, AKTsignaling, and cytoskeleton modulation. In particular, downregulation of RTN4reduced sphingomyelin synthesis and impaired plasma membrane localization of AKT,wherein AKT phosphorylation, involved in many cancers, was significantly reduced without any comparable effect on AKT-related upstream kinases, in asphingolipid-dependent manner. Furthermore, knockdown of RTN4 retardedproliferation of cancer cells in vitro as well as tumor xenografts in mice.Finally, RTN4 knockdown affected tubulin stability and promoted higher cytotoxic effects with chemotherapeutic paclitaxel in cancer cells both in vitro andin vivo. In summary, RTN4 is involved in carcinogenesis and represents amolecular candidate that may be targeted to achieve desired antitumor effects in clinics.Copyright © 2018 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.
