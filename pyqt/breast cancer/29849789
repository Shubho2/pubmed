China.Oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (oHSV-1) vectors are promising therapeuticagents for cancer. The deletion of the γ34.5 gene eliminates the neurovirulencebut attenuates virus replication at the same time. The carboxyl-terminus ofprotein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A (also known as MyD116/GADD34) ishomologous to that of γ34.5; hence, it may substitute for γ34.5 to enhance thereplication and cytotoxicity of the virus. To investigate whether the C-terminus of MyD116 can enhance the anti-tumour efficacy of G47Δ on human breast cancercells, a GD116 mutant was constructed by inserting a γ34.5-MyD116 chimaera intothe G47Δ genome using a bacterial artificial chromosome and two recombinasesystems (Cre/loxP and FLPE/FRT). A GD-empty mutant containing only thecytomegalovirus sequence was also created as a control using the same method.Next, the replication and cytotoxicity of these two virus vectors were evaluated in breast cancer cells. Compared with the GD-empty vector, GD116 possessed anenhanced replication capability and oncolytic activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cells. On the fifth day after infection with GD116 at MOIs of 0.01 and 0.1, 49.2 and 82.8% of MCF-7 cells, respectively, were killed, with 35.0 and 50.2% ofMDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, killed by GD116 at MOIs of 0.1 and 0.3.Additionally, the insertion of the γ34.5-MyD116 chimaera promoted virusreplication in MDA-MB-468 at 48 h after infection, although no increasedcytotoxic effect was observed. The findings of the present study indicate thatthe C terminus of the MyD116 gene can be substituted for the corresponding domainof the γ34.5 gene of oHSV-1 to promote the replication of the virus in infectedcells. Furthermore, the novel virus mutant GD116 armed with a γ34.5-MyD116chimaera has enhanced anti-tumour efficacy against human breast cancer cells invitro.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8247 PMCID: PMC5962873PMID: 29849789
