Fiberoductoscopy (FDS) is a new diagnostic optionin PND patients. This study summarizes our initial experience of FDS for themanagement of PND patients in a single center in Poland and assesses its safety.METHODS: A total of 256 women with PND were included in this prospective,case-controlled, single-center study between 2006 and 2014. Of the 250 patientswho underwent FDS, 154 had mammary duct lesions and 96 had no visible lesions.Subsequently, 129 patients with lesions identified by FDS underwentmicroductectomy and the lesions were pathologically evaluated.RESULTS: The mean duration of FDS examination was 17Â min. The most frequentintraductal lesion was amputation of a duct (35.1%), followed by circularnarrowing or hyperplasia (22.7%). Final histological findings were unremarkablein 11.6% of cases, whereas mammary duct papilloma, duct ectasia, and ductalcarcinoma in situ were detected in 71.3, 10.9, and 6.2% of cases, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: FDS is an innovative method for visualizing intraductal mammarylesions and allows accurate selection of mammary ducts with suspicious lesionsthat require surgical removal in women with PND.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0883-3 PMID: 29938367
