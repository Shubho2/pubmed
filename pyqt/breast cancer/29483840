Although microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as novel regulators incarcinogenesis, there are still abundant hidden treasure needed to be excavated. In the present study, we found that miR-519d expression was remarkably decreased in both human BC tissues and MCF-7 cells. CCK8 and 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine(EdU) assays were used to evaluate cell proliferation. Wound-healing andtranswell assays were performed for detection of cell migration and invasion. Theresults demonstrated miR-519d overexpression dramatically suppressed MCF-7 cells proliferation, migration and invasion. While downregulation of miR-519d bymiR-519d inhibitor substantially increased MCF-7 cell carcinogenesis. Furtheranalysis identified Matrix Metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) as a direct target ofmiR-519d. QRT-PCR and western blot results indicated the correlative expressionof miR-519d and MMP3 in BC tissues and MCF-7 cells. In summary, our datauncovered the novel molecular interaction between miR-519d and MMP3, indicating atherapeutic strategy of miR-519d for BC.DOI: 10.7150/ijbs.22849 PMCID: PMC5821043PMID: 29483840
