APT signals in the tumor, before and after the first cycle ofNAC, were quantified using a three-pool Lorentzian fit of the z-spectra in theregion of interest. The changes in APT were subsequently related to pathological response after surgery defined by the Miller-Payne system.RESULTS: Significant differences (P <  0.05, unpaired Mann-Whitney test) werefound in the APT signal before and after the first cycle of NAC in six out of 10 lesions, of which two showed a pathological complete response. Of the remainingfour lesions, one showed a pathological complete response. No significantdifference in changes of APT signal were found between the different pathologicalresponses to NAC treatment (P > 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test).CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study shows the feasibility of using APT CESTmagnetic resonance imaging as a noninvasive biomarker to assess the effect of NACin an early stage of NAC treatment of breast cancer patients.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration number, NL49333.041.14/ NTR4980 .
