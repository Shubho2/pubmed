Cardiovascular riskfactor stratification is important to predict short term cardiac events duringcancer therapy and long term cardiac event free survival in cancer patients. Wesought to determine the prevalence of CAC and clinical reporting rates in acohort of cancer patients at high risk of cancer therapy related cardiac events.Methods: 408 Breast cancer patients who were referred to a cardiac oncologyclinic were screened. Inclusion criteria included having had a CT chest and theabsence of known coronary disease. Among those screened 263 patients wereincluded in the study.Results: CAC was identified in 70 patients (26%). CAC was reported in 18% ofstudies. The reporting rates of CAC increased with the extent of coronarycalcification (p < 0.01) and increased during the period of the study (p < 0.05).Conclusions: CAC was commonly detected on chest CT studies in this observational study of breast cancer patients at high risk of cardiac oncology events. Thepresence of CAC was often not reported clinically but reporting rates haveincreased over time. Recent SCCT/STR guidelines recommend reporting the presence of CAC on routine chest CT scans in recognition of the importance of CAC as apredictor of cardiovascular events. Reporting of CAC on chest CTs may help tofurther risk stratify breast cancer patients and improve cardiovascular outcomes in this vulnerable population.DOI: 10.1016/j.ijcha.2018.02.001 PMCID: PMC5941242PMID: 29750180
