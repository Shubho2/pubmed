Patients were retrospectivelyanalyzed for LC, locoregional control, metastasis-free survival (MFS), overallsurvival (OS), and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS).RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 121 months (range, 4-200), 21 (2.7%)in-breast recurrences (IBRs) were observed, 107 patients (14%) died and 106 (14%)developed metastases. Ten-year rates of LC, locoregional control, MFS, OS, andBCSS amounted to 97.2%, 96.5%, 86%, 85.7%, and 93.2 %, respectively. Inmultivariate analysis, HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer subtype (TN)turned out to be significant negative predictors for IBRs (hazard ratios, 15.02and 12.87, respectively; P < .05). Sorted by subtypes, 10-year LC rates wereobserved in 98.7% (range, 96.7%-99.5%) (luminal A), 98% (range, 94%-99.3%)(luminal B), 87.9% (range, 66.2%-96%) (HER2+), and 89% (range, 76.9%-94.9%) (TN),respectively.CONCLUSIONS: After 10 years, boost IOERT maintains high LC rates in any risksetting.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
