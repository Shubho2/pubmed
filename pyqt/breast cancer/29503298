Among AI/ANs with IHSCS enrollment, there was not a significantassociation between late-stage disease and AI/AN race for any of the four cancersevaluated.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that enrollment in the IHSCS reduced thedisparity between AI/ANs and NHWs with respect to late-stage cancer diagnoses.DOI: 10.1353/hpu.2018.0017 PMID: 29503298
