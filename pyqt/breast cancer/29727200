Thecurrent review is an update of the paper published in 2012. We provide the newdata on the tamoxifen targets that are the key points of signaling cascadesactivating cellular proliferation, which determines aggressiveness of disease andchemotherapy resistance or sensitivity. Some inspiring clinical cases dealingwith tamoxifen efficiency in treatment of different tumors are discussed.Additionally, the review includes data on antiviral, antibacterial, antifungaland antiparasitic activity of tamoxifen.DOI: 10.1080/07357907.2018.1453933 PMID: 29727200  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
