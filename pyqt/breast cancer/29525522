The Distress Thermometer and Problem List (DT&PL) iscommonly used in oncology clinics to screen for distress and its accompanyingPhysical Problem List (PPL) identifies pertinent physical symptoms.OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify physical symptoms found on the PPL and evaluate whether they are associated with psychologic symptoms in women with breastcancer.METHODS: Patients (n=125) with breast cancer (Stage 0-IV) completed the DT&PL andthe Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. They reported bother from any of 22PPL items on the DT&PL. PPL items were assessed for their associations withdistress, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-anxiety, and Hospital Anxiety andDepression Scale-depression. The total number of PPL items endorsed per patientwas evaluated for associations with psychologic outcomes, controlling forrelevant demographic factors.RESULTS: Most physical problems were associated with depression (n = 13, 87%),and anxiety (n = 8, 53%), but fewer were associated with distress (n = 4, 27%).In multivariate analyses, a higher total number of problems was associated withyounger age (p = 0.03) and more depressive symptoms (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Physical symptom burden detected by the DT&PL co-occurs withdepression most commonly and to a lesser extent anxiety and distress in womenwith breast cancer. Depression is associated with more types of physical symptomsand a total number of physical symptoms. The endorsement of multiple PPL items onthe DT&PL should prompt an evaluation for depression. Similarly, depressionshould prompt the evaluation and treatment of physical symptom burden.Copyright Â© 2018 The Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine. Published by ElsevierInc.
