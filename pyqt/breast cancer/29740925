We here outline a systematic chemoinformatics approach tocomputationally predict biomolecular targets of metformin. Using severalstructure- and ligand-based software tools and reference databases containing1,300,000 chemical compounds and more than 9,000 binding sites protein cavities, we identified 41 putative metformin targets including several epigeneticmodifiers such as the member of the H3K27me3-specific demethylase subfamily,KDM6A/UTX. AlphaScreen and AlphaLISA assays confirmed the ability of metformin toinhibit the demethylation activity of purified KDM6A/UTX enzyme. Structuralstudies revealed that metformin might occupy the same set of residues involved inH3K27me3 binding and demethylation within the catalytic pocket of KDM6A/UTX.Millimolar metformin augmented global levels of H3K27me3 in cultured cells,including reversion of global loss of H3K27me3 occurring in premature agingsyndromes, irrespective of mitochondrial complex I or AMPK. Pharmacological dosesof metformin in drinking water or intraperitoneal injection significantlyelevated the global levels of H3K27me3 in the hepatic tissue of low-densitylipoprotein receptor-deficient mice and in the tumor tissues of highly aggressivebreast cancer xenograft-bearing mice. Moreover, nondiabetic breast cancerpatients receiving oral metformin in addition to standard therapy presented anelevated level of circulating H3K27me3. Our biocomputational approach coupled to experimental validation reveals that metformin might directly regulate thebiological machinery of aging by targeting core chromatin modifiers of theepigenome.© 2018 The Authors.
