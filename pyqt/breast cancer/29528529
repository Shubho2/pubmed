Sense of coherence guides the person in finding and utilizing resources to maintain health and manage stress. Previously, we demonstrated SOC's stabilityover time among breast cancer (BC) patients, and in the present article, SOC'spredictive value for survival is tested.METHODS: A cohort of 487 women underwent surgery for invasive BC and completedpreoperatively the SOC-13 within a multicenter trial. Hazard ratios (HRs) wereperformed to identify significant independent predictors and their associationwith increase in SOC.RESULTS: Over a median follow-up time of 10 years, patients with a higher SOC had63% lower risk of BC progression (HR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.85, P .03), 80%lower risk of BC mortality (HR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.96, P .00), and 80% lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.93, P .00) than patients with a lower SOC. The mortality risk declined by 2.3% for every 1-unit increasein SOC, both for BC mortality (HR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96 to 0.99, P .01) and forall-cause mortality (HR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96 to 0.99, P .00). The risk ofprogression declined by 1.4% for every 1-unit increase in SOC (HR 0.99; 95% CI,0.97 to 1.00, P .03).CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of SOC's predictive value for diseaseprogression and BC-caused and all-cause mortality. Sense of coherence provides a complement when designing individual plans that aims to support patients duringtheir treatment.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4702 PMID: 29528529
