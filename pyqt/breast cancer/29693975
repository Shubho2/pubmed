Email: msepandi@gmail.comObjectives: Radiologists face uncertainty in making decisions based on theirjudgment of breast cancer risk. Artificial intelligence and machine learningtechniques have been widely applied in detection/recognition of cancer. Thisstudy aimed to establish a model to aid radiologists in breast cancer riskestimation. This incorporated imaging methods and fine needle aspiration biopsy(FNAB) for cyto-pathological diagnosis. Methods: An artificial neural network(ANN) technique was used on a retrospectively collected dataset includingmammographic results, risk factors, and clinical findings to accurately predictthe probability of breast cancer in individual patients. Area under thereceiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity,specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were used to evaluatediscriminative performance. Result: The network incorporating the selectedfeatures performed best (AUC = 0.955). Sensitivity and specificity of the ANNwere respectively calculated as 0.82 and 0.90. In addition, negative and positivepredictive values were respectively computed as 0.90 and 0.80. Conclusion: ANNhas potential applications as a decision-support tool to help underperformingpractitioners to improve the positive predictive value of biopsy recommendations.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.1017 PMCID: PMC6031801PMID: 29693975
