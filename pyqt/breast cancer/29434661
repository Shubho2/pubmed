There is a finite rate of ipsilateralbreast tumour recurrence (IBTR) for breast conserving therapy (BCT) with annualrates of less than 1% for specialist breast practices. There has been recentconsensus on the definition of an adequate resection margin for both invasive andnoninvasive breast cancer treated with BCS, although some variation in marginpolicy persists with definitions of 'no tumour at ink', 1 and 2 mm marginmandates. Despite the development of methods for intraoperative assessment ofmargins, up to 20% of patients require further surgery (cavity re-excision orcompletion mastectomy) to achieve clear surgical margins. In the past decade,several novel technologies for intraoperative margin assessment have beenexplored with the aim of reducing rates of re-operation and its attendant patientanxiety, inconvenience and additional cost. Ongoing studies are addressing thesafety, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of these novel technologies relativeto methods in routine clinical usage.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.795 PMCID: PMC5804713PMID: 29434661
