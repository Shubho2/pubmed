The subjects of this study were a total of 251 plasma samples from 128 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BCpatients. Of these plasma samples, 133 were from 73 primary BC (PBC) patients,and 118 plasma samples were from 68 metastatic BC (MBC) patients. We developeddroplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assays to verify the clinical significance of PIK3CA,AKT1, and ESR1 mutations in these patients. cfDNA PIK3CA mutations were observed in 15.1% of the PBC patients, while a cfDNA AKT1 mutation was observed in 1.4% ofpatients, and cfDNA ESR1 mutations were observed in 2.7% of patients. Patientswith detectable cfDNA PIK3CA mutations were not associated with clinicaloutcomes. According to the TL, the prevalence of the PIK3CA and ESR1 mutations incfDNA were lower in early TLs compared with late TLs. In the early TL group,patients with cfDNA PIK3CA mutations had a shorter time to treatment failure(TTF) than patients without mutations (P = 0.035). However, there was nostatistically significant difference between patients with or without cfDNA ESR1 mutations. However, in the late TL group, patients with cfDNA ESR1 mutations had a shorter TTF than patients without mutations (P = 0.048). However, there was no statistically significant difference between patients with or without cfDNAPIK3CA mutations. Since the prevalence of cfDNA AKT1 mutation is low in both PBC and MBC patients, the impact of AKT1 mutations on the prognosis remains unclear. We have demonstrated the difference in the clinical significance of the hotspotPIK3CA, AKT1, and ESR1 mutations in cfDNA for each TL in ER+ BC patients.DOI: 10.1186/s12943-018-0808-y PMID: 29482551
