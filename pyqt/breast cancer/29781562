However, therole and mechanisms of interleukins (ILs) on the progression of breast cancer arenot well illustrated. Our present study revealed that the expressions of IL-6 andIL-8 were significantly increased in oestrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breastcancer cells. Increased expression of IL-6 was observed in 83.9% (26/31) ER-breast cancer tissues as compared with their matched adjacent normal tissues. In vitro studies indicated that IL-6 can significantly promote the migration andinvasion of ER- breast cancer cells via increasing the dephosphorylation, nucleartranslocation and transcriptional activities of YAP in breast cancer cells.Knockdown of YAP can attenuate IL-6-induced migration and invasion of cancercells, suggesting that YAP plays an essential role in IL-6-induced malignancy of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, IL-6 treatment also decreased thephosphorylation of LATS1/2. The knockdown of LATS1/2 synergistically suppressedsi-IL-6-induced deactivation of YAP. Targeted inhibition of IL-6/YAP cansignificantly suppress the invasion of ER- breast cancer cells. Collectively, ourstudy revealed that IL-6 can trigger the malignancy of breast cancer cells viaactivation of YAP signals. Targeted inhibition of IL-6/YAP might be a noveltherapeutic approach for the treatment of ER- breast cancer.Â© 2018 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former NordicPharmacological Society).DOI: 10.1111/bcpt.13042 PMID: 29781562
