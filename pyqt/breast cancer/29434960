China.The aim of the present study was to develop a water-soluble biomarker for thedetection of breast cancer using quantum dots (QDs) conjugated to Ki-67, anuclear protein associated with the cell cycle. Ki-67 is also a marker of cellproliferation, with expression levels categorizing good and poor prognosis ininvasive breast cancer. Ki-67 is a clinically used biomarker for breast cancerdiagnosis, treatment and prognosis. Owing to the optical and chemical advantages of QDs, QD-based nanotechnology may aid the construction of a biomedical imaging platform for the study of cancer cell behavior. In the present study, a biomarkerwas prepared by employing the water-soluble CuInS2/ZnS QDs conjugated to ananti-Ki-67 monoclonal antibody to detect Ki-67 expression in breast cancer. TheQDs, which were hydrophobic and coated with octadecylamine, were encapsulatedwith an amphiphilic biocompatible centipede-like polymer, and then conjugated to anti-Ki-67 monoclonal antibodies (QD-Ki-67 probes). The QD-Ki-67 probes retained the original optical properties of the unadorned QDs and did not exhibit distincttoxic side effects in in vitro cytotoxicity experiments. Therefore, thisCuInS2/ZnS QD-labeled bioprobe, with a high quantum yield and low cytotoxicity,is a promising candidate for bioimaging and may be used as a cell label.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7615 PMCID: PMC5777344PMID: 29434960
