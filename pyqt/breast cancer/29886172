[Epub ahead of print]LncRNA SNHG1 regulates the differentiation of Treg cells and affects the immuneescape of breast cancer via regulating miR-448/IDO.Pei X(1), Wang X(1), Li H(2).Author information: (1)Department of Breast Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of ZhengzhouUniversity, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China.(2)Department of Pathology, The First Affiliated Hospital of ZhengzhouUniversity, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China. Electronic address:lihuixiang19@126.com.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of lncRNA SNHG1 in the immune escape ofbreast cancer (BC).METHODS: SNHG1, miR-448 and IL-10 levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR. The proteinlevels of IDO and Foxp3 were measured by Western blot. SNHG1 and miR-448interaction was tested by RIP assay and RNA pull-down assay. MiR-448 and IDOinteraction was observed by luciferase reporter assay.RESULTS: Compared with CD4+T cells, miR-448 expression in CD4+ TIL cells wasdecreased, while the expression of SNHG1, IDO, IL-10 and Foxp3 were increased.Moreover, SNHG1 directly contacted with miR-448, which could negatively regulate IDO. In cells treated with siRNA-SNHG and miR-448 inhibitor, interference SNHG1up-regulated miR-448 expression and down-regulated IDO expression, while miR-448 inhibitor reversed this effect. In addition, miR-448 inhibitor reversed theinhibitory effect of siRNA-SNHG1 on Treg cell differentiation, and siRNA-SNHG1could reduce tumor volume and down-regulated the expressions of SNHG1, IL-10, IDOand Foxp3.CONCLUSION: Interference SNHG1 could inhibit the differentiation of Treg cells bypromoting miR-448 expression and reducing IDO level, thereby impeding the immune escape of BC.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
