The molecular mechanism that regulates glioblastoma occurrence stillremains unknown. MicroRNA (miR)‑500a‑5p has been reported to be involved inhepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer. Whether miR‑500a‑5p regulatesglioblastoma progression requires further investigation. In the present study,miR‑500a‑5p was highly expressed in malignant glioblastoma tissues and celllines. Overexpression of miR‑500a‑5p promoted glioblastoma cell proliferation,migration and invasion in vitro. In addition, knockdown of miR‑500a‑5paccelerated cell apoptosis. Furthermore, miR‑500a‑5p inhibition significantlyimpaired tumor growth in vivo. The present study further explored the downstream mechanism. The luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR‑500a‑5p directly bindsthe 3'‑untranslated region of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) mRNA. MiR‑500a‑5p markedly inhibited CHD5 expression in glioblastoma cells.Furthermore, CHD5 was downregulated in glioblastoma tissues, and the expressionlevels of miR‑500a‑5p and CHD5 were inversely correlated. In addition, knockdown of CHD5 restored the inhibition of cell proliferation and migration triggered by miR‑500a‑5p silence. Finally, it was demonstrated that miR‑500a‑5p can serve as anovel biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of glioblastoma patients. Takentogether, the results of the present study indicated that miR‑500a‑5p may havepromoted glioblastoma development and progression by targeting CHD5.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9259 PMID: 30015879
