Research shows thatcancer morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early detection. Yet, bothcancer risks and screening behavior remain understudied in the homelesspopulation.METHODS: Researchers conducted a cross-sectional survey of homeless individuals(n = 201). The analysis describes the demographic, psychosocial, and behavioralassociations with cancer screenings and knowledge of the lung cancer screeningrecommendation.RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 51.7 years (SD 13.6); the group was largelyAfrican American (77.3%) and male (67.9%). Among women, the breast and cervicalcancer screening rates were 46.5% and 85.1%. Among men the prostate cancerscreening rate was 34.2%. Among all participants, the colon cancer screening ratewas 44%. Cancer risk behaviors were high. Lung cancer screening knowledge was low(23.0%). Some cancer screening behaviors were associated with age, income, healthstatus, obesity, tobacco use, and physical activity.DISCUSSION: Despite higher cancer risk behaviors, knowledge and generalparticipation rates for cancer screenings were below national benchmarks.CONCLUSION: To improve cancer survival among disparate populations, sustainedcommunity outreach is necessary to increase awareness of screeningrecommendations, identify high-risk individuals, and navigate them to resources.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/phn.12391 PMID: 29473212
