We thoroughly reviewed the up-to-date evidence onsurgical resection of the primary lesion in metastatic breast cancer, includingcomparative studies (of particular interest in risk modifiers, the type, andtiming of surgical procedures), Chinese and international guidelines, as well as the progress of clinical trials. Partial modified radical mastectomy andbreast-conserving surgery are by far the most common choices for patients withmetastatic breast cancer. Patients with certain characteristics, for example,younger than 45 years of age or with oligo-metastasis, might benefit from thesurgery. The type and timing of surgical procedures are still in debate accordingto the guidelines from different countries. Forthcoming evidence from the ongoingclinical trials might help close the knowledge gaps in surgical treatment forpatients with metastatic breast cancer and aid the decision-making in clinicalpractice.DOI: 10.21037/cco.2018.05.03 PMID: 30056726
