The study aims to assess the expression of Lgr5 andCD133 in pre-malignant (adenomatous polyps and IBD), malignant colorectal lesionsand normal colonic mucosa by immunohistochemical staining.MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective study was done on 100 patients presenting with colonic symptoms, patients were divided into four groups; group I including 20 patients in the control group, group II including 20 ulcerative colitis (U.C) patients, group III including 20 patients with adenomatous polyps and group IVincluding 40 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).RESULTS: Lgr5 and CD133 expression was significantly higher in carcinoma than in adenomas, IBD and normal mucosa (P < 0.001). Lrg5 and CD133 was positivelycorrelated with histological grade (P = 0.001), depth of invasion (P = 0.001),lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), distant metastasis (P < 0.004) and TNM stage(P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Role of Lgr5 and CD133 as stem cell marker was expressed andpresented with different expression in the normal colonic mucosa, adenoma and CRCand showed increased expression in an advanced stage of CRC. This may suggest itspossible involvement in colorectal tumorigenesis and invasion.DOI: 10.3889/oamjms.2018.208 PMCID: PMC6026422PMID: 29983786
