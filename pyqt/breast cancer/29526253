Electronic address: priyasrinivas@rgcb.res.in.Chromosome 17 (Chr17) harbors crucial genes that encode proteins implicated in a variety of cancers, including some that guard cancer cells from genomicinstability and others that interfere with metastasis. Included amongst the geneson chr17 that regulate biological processes fundamental to the genesis of cancer are TP53, BRCA1, CCL5, NF-1, and GRB7. As many as 50% of all human tumors and at least 30% of breast carcinomas contain p53 mutations, while 30%-40% of breastcancers have defective BRCA1. A large number of proteins regulate the expression of these cancer genes on chr17 with miRNAs, the most widely studied class ofregulatory RNAs, playing a major role in epigenetically controlling the geneexpression programs, thereby managing various cellular functions. This reviewprovides information on the genes transcribed from chr17, and their regulation bymiRNAs in the context to tumorigenesis located on chr17, along with an analysisof the receptor status (estrogen, progesterone, and Her2/Neu) from the miRNAprediction data of miRNA genes located on chr17.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.
