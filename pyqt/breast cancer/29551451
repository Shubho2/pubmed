However, there have not been any scientific reportsregarding the medicinal properties of this plant, and no experiments have beendone to ascertain the safety of the extract.AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of this work was to evaluate the toxicity ofParinari kerstingii Engl. extracts as an herbal remedy and to investigate itsanti-inflammatory potential in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley albino male rats were used in theseexperiments. 100, 300 and 600 mg/kg of body weight doses of Parinari kerstingiiEngl. water extract (PKWE) were used for a 14 day toxicity study. For theanti-inflammatory studies, the carrageenan-induced paw edema model was used toinvestigate the effect of four fractions of Parinari kerstingii Engl. ethanolextract [petroleum ether (fraction A), ethyl acetate (fraction B), n -butanol(fraction C) and water (fraction D)] on the paw size of rats and to investigatethe inhibitory effects of Parinari kerstingii Engl. water (PKWE) and Parinarikerstingii Engl. ethanol extract (PKEE).RESULTS: The administration of 100 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg of body weight doses ofParinari kerstingii Engl. water extract showed no sign of toxicity. However, the 600 mg/kg of body weight dose showed a very significant increase in creatinineconcentration. All the fractions of Parinari kerstingii Engl. extractdemonstrated anti-inflammatory effects, as shown by a significant reduction incarrageenan-induced paw edema and by a significant decrease in the production of IL-1, TNF-α, COX-2, NF-кB, and PGE2. Moreover, fraction A and B showed enhancedin vivo anti-inflammatory effects compared to aspirin. Furthermore, PKEE wasdemonstrated to be more effective than PKWE.CONCLUSION: We present the first report on the plant Parinari kerstingii Engl.Based on our findings, PKWE at a dose of up to 300 mg/kg of body weight for 14days is considered safe, and our anti-inflammatory results support itstraditional use. Overall, Parinari kerstingii Engl. has been demonstrated to be apotential drug candidate. Thus, further experiments, such as isolation/structuralelucidation of the phytochemicals and biological screening of this plant, need tobe done.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
