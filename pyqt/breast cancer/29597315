Theapplication of nanoparticles in medicine is in the core of nanomedicine.Nanoparticles can be used in drug delivery for improving the uptake of poorlysoluble drugs, targeted delivery to a specific site, and drug bioavailability.Early diagnosis of and targeted therapies for cancers can significantly improvepatients' quality of life and extend patients' lives. The advantages ofnanoparticles have given them a progressively important role in the nanodiagnosisand nanotherapy of common cancers. To provide a reference for the furtherapplication of nanoparticles, this review focuses on the recent development andapplication of nanoparticles in the early diagnosis and treatment of the threecommon cancers (lung cancer, liver cancer, and breast cancer) by using quantumdots, magnetic nanoparticles, and gold nanoparticles.DOI: 10.3390/nano8040202 PMCID: PMC5923532PMID: 29597315
