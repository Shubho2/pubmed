Our study aimed to determine the frequency of mutations in four genes: EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ERBB4 and to investigate whether these mutations affectcellular behaviour and therapy response in vitro and outcomes after adjuvanttrastuzumab-based therapy in clinical samples.Methods: We performed Agena MassArray analysis of 227 HER2+ breast cancer samplesto identify the type and frequency of ERBB family mutations. Of these, twomutations, the somatic mutations ERBB4-V721I and ERBB4-S303F, were stablytransfected into HCC1954 (PIK3CA mutant), HCC1569 (PIK3CA wildtype) and BT474(PIK3CA mutant, ER positive) HER2+ breast cancer cell lines for functional invitro experiments.Results: A total of 12 somatic, likely deleterious mutations in the kinase andfurin-like domains of the ERBB genes (3 EGFR, 1 ERBB2, 3 ERBB3, 5 ERBB4) wereidentified in 7% of HER2+ breast cancers, with ERBB4 the most frequently mutated gene. The ERBB4-V721I kinase domain mutation significantly increased 3D-colonyformation in 3/3 cell lines, whereas ERBB4-S303F did not increase growth rate or 3D colony formation in vitro. ERBB4-V721I sensitized HCC1569 cells (PIK3CAwildtype) to the pan class I PI3K inhibitor copanlisib but increased resistanceto the pan-HER family inhibitor afatinib. The combinations of copanlisib withtrastuzumab, lapatinib, or afatinib remained synergistic regardless ofERBB4-V721I or ERBB4-S303F mutation status.Conclusions: ERBB gene family mutations, which are present in 7% of our HER2+breast cancer cohort, may have the potential to alter cellular behaviour and the efficacy of HER- and PI3K-inhibition.DOI: 10.1177/1758835918778297 PMCID: PMC6047239PMID: 30023006
