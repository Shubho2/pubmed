Based on the results of subsequent research, the use of this drug has been expanded to patients with metastatic breast cancer withgermline BRCA mutation. With the use of a relatively new medication and a larger patient population eligible for therapy, monitoring for novel adverse eventsassociated with therapy is important. This case represents a patient withmetastatic breast cancer and germline BRCA2 mutation who developed erythemanodosum after initiation of therapy with olaparib capsules. Her characteristicrash appeared shortly after starting olaparib and recurred after restartingolaparib an additional two times. She was treated with short courses ofprednisone therapy with or without holding olaparib with resolution of her rash. The patient was later restarted on olaparib capsules 200 mg twice daily, and she more recently has been maintained on olaparib tablets 300 mg twice daily. On bothregimens, the patient experienced only attenuated episodes of erythema nodosumthat have not required cessation of therapy or steroid therapy.DOI: 10.1155/2018/9529821 PMCID: PMC6040243PMID: 30050710
