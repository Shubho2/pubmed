Lesion ADC estimates were obtained separately from all b-value images (ADC; b=50, 400 and 800s/mm2), lower b-value images (ADClow; b=50 and 400s/mm2)and higher b-value images (ADChigh; b=400 and 800s/mm2). A set of dual-phase ADC (dpADC) models were constructed using ADClow, ADChigh and a perfusion influencefactor ranging from 0 to 1.Results: Strong positive correlation is observable between ADC and all dpADCs(ρ=0.80-1.00). Differences in ADC and dpADCs between the benign and the malignantlesions are all significant (p<0.05). In detecting malignancy, traditional lesionADC provides a good performance (AUC=89.9%) however dpADC0.5 (dpADC with a factorof 0.5) accomplishes a better performance (AUC=90.8%). At optimal thresholds, ADCachieves 94.1% sensitivity, 72.7% specificity and 83.2% accuracy while dpADC0.5leads to 92.9% sensitivity, 79.5% specificity and 86.1% accuracy.Conclusion: Dual-phase ADC modelling may improve the accuracy in breast cancerdiagnosis using DWI. Further prospective studies are needed to justify itsbenefit in clinical setting.DOI: 10.5152/ejbh.2018.3829 PMCID: PMC5939984PMID: 29774316
