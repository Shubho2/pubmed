China.Lysine-specific demethylase 5A (KDM5A) has recently become a promising target forepigenetic therapy. In this study, we designed and synthesized metal complexesbearing ligands with reported demethylase and p27 modulating activities. TheRh(III) complex 1 was identified as a direct, selective and potent inhibitor ofKDM5A that directly abrogate KDM5A demethylase activity via antagonizing theKDM5A-tri-/di-methylated histone 3 protein-protein interaction (PPI) in vitro andin cellulo. Complex 1 induced accumulation of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 levels incells, causing growth arrest at G1 phase in the triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC) cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and 4T1. Finally, 1 exhibited potent anti-tumoractivity against TNBC xenografts in an in vivo mouse model, presumably viatargeting of KDM5A and hence upregulating p27. Moreover, complex 1 was less toxiccompared with two clinical drugs, cisplatin and doxorubicin. To our knowledge,complex 1 is the first metal-based KDM5A inhibitor reported in the literature. Weanticipate that complex 1 may be used as a novel scaffold for the furtherdevelopment of more potent epigenetic agents against cancers, including TNBC.Â© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
