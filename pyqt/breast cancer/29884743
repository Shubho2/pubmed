[Epub ahead of print]Targeted therapy for premenopausal women with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer: focus on special considerations and latest advances.Bardia A(1), Hurvitz S(2).Author information: (1)Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center Bardia.Aditya@mgh.harvard.edu.(2)Division of Hematology-Oncology, Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.The incidence of advanced breast cancer in premenopausal women is increasing, andbreast cancer in younger women is often more aggressive and has a worse prognosiscompared with older women. Premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive(HR+) breast cancer are frequently under-represented in clinical trials, andtreatment strategies in the premenopausal setting are usually extrapolated fromdata from postmenopausal patients, with the addition of ovarian functionsuppression to endocrine therapy in HR+ disease. However, the underlying biology of breast cancer in premenopausal women can be different from postmenopausalwomen, and treatment strategies should ideally be specifically tested inpremenopausal patients. Recent phase III trials have now investigatedcyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors in premenopausal patients withHR+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breastcancer: palbociclib and abemaciclib have been tested in a subset of premenopausalpatients in the PALOMA-3 and MONARCH-2 studies, and ribociclib has been tested inthe phase III MONALEESA-7 trial, which was entirely dedicated to premenopausalwomen. This comprehensive review summarizes the differences in biology of HR+,HER2- breast cancer in the premenopausal population compared with thepostmenopausal population, discusses special considerations for treatment ofpremenopausal women, and reviews the evidence from clinical trials investigating endocrine therapy, other targeted treatments, and ovarian function suppression inthe HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer setting.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0162 PMID: 29884743
