TI longer than 30 days is associated with a greater chance of delay of chemotherapy, which mayimpact survival. We sought to identify factors associated with longer TI and the influence on outcome measures.METHODS: We examined TI for stage 0-III breastcancer patients treated between 2006 and 2015 at a university-based cancercenter. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to study factorsassociated with TI <30, 30 to 60, and >60 days. Kaplan-Meier plots were used toexamine the effect of different TI on overall survival, disease-specificsurvival, and recurrence-free survival.RESULTS: 1589 patients were included with a median follow-up of 47 months. MedianTI was 32 days. Median TI increased in patients from 2011 to 2015 compared withthose from 2006 to 2010 (35 vs 30 days, P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis,mastectomy (with or without reconstruction), MRI use, and increasing age wereindependent predictors of TI >30 days . There were no significant differences in overall survival, disease-specific survival, or recurrence-free survival. Therewas no association between TI >30 days and a subsequent delay >60 days toadjuvant chemotherapy (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.72-1.52).CONCLUSIONS: TI has increased in the last five years. Patient characteristics,tumor biology, and stage do not influence TI, whereas age, mastectomy, and MRIuse were all associated with longer TI. Longer TI does not appear tosignificantly delay adjuvant chemotherapy or influence short-term outcomes.PMID: 29428030  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
