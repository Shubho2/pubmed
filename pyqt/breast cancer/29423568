However, literature indicates adherence to surveillance guidelines is inconsistent at best. Using the Messaging Model for Health CommunicationCampaigns framework, we undertook a two-phase formative research approach todevelop an intervention to promote adherence to surveillance guidelines.Discussion groups identified preferred intervention format and function in phase I. Findings indicated carriers desired a phone application (app) to assist withsurveillance management and appointment tracking. Thus, an iPhone app forcarriers to track appointments based on published surveillance guidelines wasdeveloped. In phase II, we obtained feedback from BRCA carriers via a surveyduring a prototype demonstration at a regional conference. Participants in phase II wanted reminder capabilities and the ability to add and modify informationfields. This feedback informed intervention modifications, resulting in theScheduling Necessary Advised Procedures (SNAP) iPhone app currently being pilottested by BRCA carriers throughout the USA.DOI: 10.1007/s10897-018-0222-z PMID: 29423568
