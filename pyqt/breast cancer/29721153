Themulti-compartment protein p32 is overexpressed and present at cell surfaces in a variety of tumors, including TNBC, specifically in the malignant cells andendothelial cells, and in macrophages localized in hypoxic areas of the tumor.Herein we used polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone polymersomes that wereaffinity targeted with the p32-binding tumor penetrating peptide LinTT1(AKRGARSTA) for imaging of TNBC lesions. A tyrosine residue was added to thepeptide to allow for 124I labeling and PET imaging. In a TNBC model in mice,systemic LinTT1-targeted polymersomes accumulated in early tumor lesions morethan twice as efficiently as untargeted polymersomes with up to 20% ID/cc at 24 hafter administration. The PET-imaging was very sensitive, allowing detection oftumors as small as ∼20 mm3. Confocal imaging of tumor tissue sections revealed a high degree of vascular exit and stromal penetration of LinTT1-targetedpolymersomes and co-localization with tumor-associated macrophages. Our studiesshow that systemic LinTT1-targeted polymersomes can be potentially used forprecision-guided tumor imaging and treatment of TNBC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24588 PMCID: PMC5922347PMID: 29721153
