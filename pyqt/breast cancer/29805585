China.The efficacy of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) following sentinel lymphnode biopsy (SLNB) has been questioned. The present study was performed todetermine the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of axillary ultrasound (US)and fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in the diagnosis of axillary metastases in patients with early breast cancer. A total of 214 patients with stage I and IIbreast cancer between June 2015 and January 2017 were included. All of thepatients received axillary US as a primary investigation for lymph node status.US-guided FNAB was performed on suspicious lymph nodes. Those with non-suspiciousand FNAB-negative axillary nodes proceeded to SLNB at the time of primary breast surgery. ALND was performed when the result of the US-guided FNAB was positive.The results of US and cytology were compared to histopathological results todetermine their sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and accuracy. A total of 76 out of 214 patients (35.5%) had axillary lymph nodemetastases at final histology. The sensitivity and specificity of axillary USalone were 59.2% (45/76) and 78.3% (108/138), respectively. Axillary US with FNABidentified 32 patients with positive lymph node metastases, and increased thesensitivity and specificity to 71.1% (32/45) and 100.0% (30/30). Combined withFNAB, the positive and negative predictive values were 100.0% (32/32) and 69.8%(30/43), respectively. Axillary US-alone or combined US/FNAB had a high accuracy rate and a satisfactory result as they cost less and it is easy to assess thestatus of axillary lymph nodes. Thus, axillary US with FNAB may avoid unnecessarySLNB in a significant number of patients.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8445 PMCID: PMC5958674PMID: 29805585
