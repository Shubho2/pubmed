To measure QOL among BC Egyptian females, then to compare HRQOL scoresin BC patients receiving different lines of treatment. A comparativecross-sectional study on a sample 142 BC survivor receiving different lines oftreatment, using EORTC QLQ-C30, and a BC-specific scale (QLQBR23 scale). Theemotional functioning had the lowest score (29.22 ± 8.1), the most prominentsymptom was appetite loss (69.48 ± 15.6) and in QLQ-BC23 scale, the futureperspectives had the lowest score among functioning scale (19.71 ± 4.9). Whileamong the symptoms scale; the most annoying symptom was upset by hair loss(89.67 ± 15.5). A significant difference in emotional subscale between threelines of treatment (p = 0.000) with the hormone therapy had the highest GlobalQOL (41.17 ± 9.97) (p = 0.008). Significant inverse correlation between the levelof Global QOL and presence of chronic disease in the chemotherapy group(p = 0.001) and stage of carcinoma in all lines of treatment. Moreover theresults proved that age and stage of carcinoma were the significant predictorsfor Global QOL. Hormonal therapy group showed the best functional scale in allsubdomains of QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BC23, while radiotherapy group showed the lowestscores in QOL-C30 and chemotherapy group in QLQ-BC23. Chemotherapy group showsthe highest level of problematic Global QOL with appetite loss in QLQ-C30 andupset from hair loss in QLQ-BC23.DOI: 10.1007/s10900-018-0538-5 PMID: 29876788
