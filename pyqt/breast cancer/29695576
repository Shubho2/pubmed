To the best of our knowledge, however, no studies regarding SII in patients with resectable non-small cell lungcancer (NSCLC) are available.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred forty-one patients with NSCLC who underwent surgery at our Institution between 2008 and 2012 were included. The SII wascalculated using the formula: platelet count × neutrophil/lymphocyte count. Theoptimal cut-off value was calculated using the Cutoff Finder(http://molpath.charite.de/cutoff). Univariate and multivariate analyses werecalculated by the Cox proportional hazards regression model.RESULTS: The optimal cut-off value was 471.2×109/l for SII. A low SII wasassociated with female gender, never smoking status, adenocarcinoma histology,higher pathological TNM stage and low level of serum C-reactive protein, but not age, serum carcinoembryonic antigen or cytokeratin 19 fragment level. Patients ofthe low SII group had a significantly better 5-year overall survival than thosewith high SII (83.61% vs. 60.39%, p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed thatthe SII was a significant independent predictive indicator for cancer-specificsurvival (p=0.007).CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that the SII could representan independent prognostic factor for patients with resectable NSCLC.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/invivo.11291 PMCID: PMC6000798PMID: 29695576
