In addition, several reports suggest antitumor effects of QNCthrough suppression of NF-κB and activation of p53. This study demonstrates theanticancer effect of QNC via a novel pathway through the elimination ofcheckpoint kinase 1/2 (Chk1/2) under p53-inactivated conditions. Inhibition ofp53 by PFT-α or siRNA promotes QNC-induced apoptosis in normal fibroblast andp53-intact cancer cells. Considering that Chk1/2 kinases exert an essential role in the control of cell cycle, inhibition of Chk1/2 by QNC may induce cell deathvia uncontrolled cell cycle progression. Indeed, QNC reduces Chk1/2 expressionunder p53-impaired cancer cells and induces cell death in the G2-M phase. QNCincreases the binding between p-Chk1/2 and β-TrCP and promotesproteasome-dependent degradation. Moreover, QNC treatment displayed antitumoreffects in a Villin-Cre;p53+/LSL-R172H intestinal cancer mouse model system aswell as HCT116 p53-/- xenografts.Implications: QNC has been used for the pastover 70 years without obvious side effects, as such it is a plausible drugcandidate for relapsed cancers, small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer as well as various p53-inactivated human malignancies.
