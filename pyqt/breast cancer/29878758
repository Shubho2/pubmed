Herein, coadministration of tumor-homing peptide iRGD and multistage-responsive penetrating nanoparticles forthe treatment of breast cancer are reported. This multistage-responsivenanoparticle, IDDHN, was comprised of an NO donor-modified hyaluronic acid (HN)shell and a small-sized dendrimer, namely, dendri-graft-l-lysine conjugated with doxorubicin and indocyanine (IDD). The results showed that IDDHN could bedegraded rapidly from about 330 nm to a smaller size that was in a size range of 35 to 150 nm (most at 35-60 nm) after hyaluronidase (HAase) incubation for 4 h;in vitro cellular uptake demonstrated that iRGD could mediate more endocytosis ofIDDHN into 4T1 cells, which was attributed to the overexpression of αvβ3 integrinreceptor. Multicellular spheroids penetration results showed synergisticallyenhanced deeper distribution of IDDHN into tumors, with the presence of iRGD,HAase incubation, and NO release upon laser irradiation. In vivo imagingindicated that coadministration with iRGD markedly enhanced the tumor targetingand penetration abilities of IDDHN. Surprisingly, coadministration of IDDHN with iRGD plus 808 nm laser irradiation nearly suppressed all tumor growth. Theseresults systematically revealed the excellent potential of coadministration ofiRGD with multistage-responsive nanoparticles for enhancing drug deliveryefficiency and overcoming the 4T1 breast cancer.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b04847 PMID: 29878758
