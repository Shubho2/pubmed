At our institution, the whole surgical specimen is imaged and thenserially sectioned with repeat imaging. A multidisciplinary discussion thendetermines need for excision of additional margins. The goal of this study was todetermine the benefit of each component of this approach in reducing the numberof positive margin.METHODS: This single-institution, prospective study included ten breast surgical oncologists who were surveyed to ascertain whether they would have takenadditional margins based their review of whole specimen images (WSI) and reviewof serially sectioned images (SSI). These results were compared with themultidisciplinary decisions (MDD) and pathology results. Margin status wasdefined using consensus guidelines.RESULTS: One hundred surveys were completed. Margins on the original specimenwere positive or close in 21%. After WSI, surgeons reported that they would have taken additional margins in 26 cases, reducing the number of positive/closemargins from 21 to 13% (p < 0.001). After SSI, 52 would have taken additionalmargins; however, the number of positive/close margins remained 13%. MDD resultedin additional margins taken in 56 cases, reducing the number of positive/closemargins to 7% (p < 0.001 compared with SSI).CONCLUSIONS: While surgeon review of specimen radiographs can decrease the numberof positive or close margins from 21 to 13%, more rigorous multidisciplinary,intraoperative margin assessment reduces the number of close or positive margins to 7%.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6607-2 PMID: 29947001
