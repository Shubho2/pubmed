It isimperative to explore approaches that can facilitate the recruitment ofunderrepresented individuals into research studies.METHODS: Two approaches, hospital and community-based recruitment (CBR), weredeveloped and implemented over 36 months to study the genetics of hereditarybreast cancer and associated cancers in Alabama, a medically underserved statewith double the national percentage of self-identifying African Americans,establishing the Alabama Hereditary Cancer Cohort.RESULTS: Overall, 242 individuals enrolled. This included 84 cancer probandsthrough hospital recruitment, as well as 76 probands and 82 family membersthrough CBR. Eighty-one percent of the study participants' counties of residence are completely medically underserved. Furthermore, African Americans represent26% of the hospital probands compared to 49% and 70% of the probands and familymembers who, respectively, enrolled through CBR.CONCLUSION: Although both recruitment mechanisms were instrumental, the uniquetrust building, educational, and traveling components of CBR facilitated theenrollment of African Americans resulting in large families for genetic analyses.The ultimate goal is to gain insight from these rudimentary efforts in order toexpand recruitment and accrue a unique resource for cancer genetics research.© 2018 The Authors.
