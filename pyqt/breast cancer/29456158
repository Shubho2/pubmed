RNA sequencingrevealed that human and murine iPSCs express tumor-associated antigens, and weshow here a proof of principle for using irradiated iPSCs in autologousanti-tumor vaccines. In a prophylactic setting, iPSC vaccines prevent tumorgrowth in syngeneic murine breast cancer, mesothelioma, and melanoma models. Asan adjuvant, the iPSC vaccine inhibited melanoma recurrence at the resection siteand reduced metastatic tumor load, which was associated with fewer Th17 cells andincreased CD11b+GR1hi myeloid cells. Adoptive transfer of T cells isolated fromvaccine-treated tumor-bearing mice inhibited tumor growth in unvaccinatedrecipients, indicating that the iPSC vaccine promotes an antigen-specificanti-tumor T cell response. Our data suggest an easy, generalizable strategy for multiple types of cancer that could prove highly valuable in clinicalimmunotherapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
