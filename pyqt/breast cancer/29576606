The authors report an unusual case ofmetastasis to the stomach as the first presentation of breast cancer, which had agood prognosis. CASE REPORT A 51-year-old female underwent radical subtotalgastrectomy and chemotherapy because of gastric cancer with distant metastasis.At the time of diagnosis of gastric cancer, she had a negative result fromroutine mammography. One year later, a newly detected lesion on routinemammography was confirmed as breast cancer. Initial diagnosis of gastric cancerwas changed to metastatic carcinoma from breast cancer throughimmunohistochemistry after bilateral mastectomy. After the completion ofchemotherapy, she is currently receiving treatment with letrozole, withoutrecurrence for 66 months. CONCLUSIONS Considering metastasis from breast cancermight be needed when unusual presentation of gastric cancer is observed eventhough gastric cancer is still one of the most common malignancies in Korea.Immunohistochemical analysis is helpful for diagnosis. Surgery for metastaticcarcinoma of the stomach could be another option for treatment.PMCID: PMC5884313PMID: 29576606
