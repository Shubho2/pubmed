Email: dusanee.s@scholar.tsu.ac.thBackground: Breast cancer screening programme is seen as the best practice todetect breast cancer early. However, there are circumstances that can preventimmigrant women from attending screening programmes. Little is known about Thaimigrants and the barriers to their seeking breast cancer screening when living ina new homeland. This paper aimed to discuss the barriers to attending screeningservices among Thai migrant women living in Australia. Methods: This studyadopted qualitative approach. Semi-structured in-depth interviewing and drawingmethods were employed as data collection technique with 25 Thai migrant women whohad not experienced breast cancer and were living in Metropolitan Melbourne,Australia. Thematic analysis method was employed to analyse the data. Results:Basing on the Health Belief Model, most Thai migrant women did not perceive that they were at risk of breast cancer. Despite seeing a breast cancer screeningprogramme as important, the women rarely paid attention to breast cancerscreening and used the mammography services provided by the Australian healthcare system. The barriers included the location of the services, unfamiliarpatterns of health care provision, and language difficulties. Conclusions: There are many barriers that that they encountered in Australia that prevent Thaimigrant women living in Melbourne Australia to pay attention to mammographicscreening service provided by Australia health system. Our findings suggest that health services and interventions need to be designed more sensitive to the needsand socio-cultural context of migrant women in general and Thai migrant women in particular.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.1089 PMCID: PMC6031773PMID: 29699369
