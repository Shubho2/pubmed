In this study, we sought toanalyze miR-29b expression in breast tumors and thus explore its clinical value.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-one malignant and 56 benign breasttissue specimens were collected and subjected to extraction of total RNA, whichwas polyadenylated and reverse transcribed to cDNA. Subsequently, a highlysensitive quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction protocol was developedand miR-29b levels, estimated via the comparative CT method, were finallysubjected to comprehensive statistical analysis.RESULTS: MiR-29b levels did not differ between the analyzed benign and malignant breast tissue specimens, but were found to be significantly (P = .010) decreased in invasive ductal adenocarcinomas compared with their lobular counterparts,albeit receiver operating characteristics curve analysis did not verify thelatter correlation. Additionally, miR-29b expression was elevated in samples withpositive estrogen receptor status (P = .021) in the overall population, whereasit was negatively correlated (P = .035) with primary tumor staging in the ductal subset and increased in poorly-differentiated tumors of lobular origin (P =.041). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses showed that patientswith ductal carcinoma and elevated miR-29b levels had a significantly longerdisease-free survival (P = .010) and a lower risk to relapse (hazard ratio =0.35, 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.81; P = .014).CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that miR-29b levels constitute apromising biomarker of favorable prognosis for patients with invasive ductalbreast carcinoma and imply that its expression status might be affected by thehistological origin of breast malignancy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.
