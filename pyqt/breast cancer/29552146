China.Accumulating studies have demonstrated microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) have an important role in multiple processes of human malignant tumor development and progression. Decreased expression of miR-125a-5p has been observed in several types of cancer,including gastric cancer (GC). However, the mechanism and exact function ofmiR-125a-5p in GC have not been largely elucidated. In the present study, reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction indicated that theexpression of miR-125a-5p was downregulated in GC tissues and cell lines comparedwith matched normal tissues (P<0.01) and normal gastric mucosa cell lines(P<0.01), respectively. Moreover, clinical pathological characteristics andKaplan-Meier analysis indicated that a low expression of miR-125a-5p was not onlyassociated with lymph metastasis, peritoneal dissemination and advancedtumor-node metastasis stage but also affected the prognosis of GC patients.Compared with miR-control-transfected GC cells, markedly decreased migration and invasion was observed in GC cells that overexpress miR-125a-5p. By contrast,increased metastasis and invasion were observed in miR-125a-5p-knocked down cellscompared with the control. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assays indicated thatbreast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) was a direct target of miR-125a-5p.Notably, a positive correlation between the levels of BRMS1 and miR-125a-5p in GCtissues was observed, and BRMS1 expression was indicated to be regulated bymiR-125a-5p in GC cells. In conclusion, miR-125a-5p may act as a tumor suppressorby targeting the metastasis-inhibitory gene, BRMS1. The data suggesting thatBRMS1 is a potential target gene of miR-125a-5p, may provide novel insight intomiRNA regulation of human gene expression, and a useful target for gene therapyof GC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7983 PMCID: PMC5840665PMID: 29552146
