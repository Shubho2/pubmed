In general, advances in targeted treatment for breast cancer have improved over the last twenty years, except in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. TNBC is an aggressive breast cancer subtype with limitedtreatment options as compared to hormone positive breast cancers. Recently,genomic profiling of TNBC shows promise in aiding clinicians to developpersonalized targeted agents. Prioritizing novel molecular-based therapies in theneoadjuvant setting may help investigators understand mechanisms of resistanceand ultimately improve patient outcomes in TNBC.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
