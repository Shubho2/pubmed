Ofthese, a total of 45 patents and 10 patents were biotech drugs and chemicaldrugs, respectively. Among the target drugs analyzed were neurotrophin-3,protocadherin 7, CXCR4, PTEN, GABA receptor 3, L1CAM, PI3K-Akt / mTOR, VEGFR2,Claudin-5, Occludin, and NKG2A, among others.CONCLUSION: In this study, we found 35 drug targets for metastasis to the brainin breast cancer, with 60% of them including only one patent, which establishesthat this area of research is very recent, and that these targets have recentlybeen linked to metastasis to the brain. On the other hand, 19 drug targets, amongthem VEGF, VEGFR2, CXCL12, and CXCR4, have been addressed for the first timeuntil 6 years ago, confirming that the development of drugs for brain metastasis in breast cancer is an incipient area, but with interesting potential.Interestingly, the stage of inside the brain, was the stage with the lowestamount of drug targets, which places it as a priority for research and drugdevelopment.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1574892813666180430113605 PMID: 29708077
