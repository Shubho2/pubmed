In terms of estrogenicity the potency of the selected compounds increased from BHA < PG <BuPB in the luciferase assay (with BHT showing no significant estrogenicactivity), while in the proliferation assay the following order was observed: BHT< BHA < BuPB (with PG showing no significant estrogenic activity). Non-monotonic dose-response curves were obtained for BuPB (in both assays) and PG (in theluciferase assay), respectively. In the presence of estradiol, a significantanti-estrogenic activity was observed in both cell lines for PG, BuPB and BHA,while BHT showed weak anti-estrogenic activity only in T47D-Kbluc cells. Theevaluation of binary mixtures confirmed the endocrine disruptive potential of thecompounds, their individual potency being correlated with that of the mixtures.All mixtures were able to reduce the estradiol-induced luminescence or cellproliferation, an effect that was accurately predicted by the dose additionmathematical model, suggesting the same (or at least partially overlapping) modesof action for the tested compounds. The results of the present study emphasizethe importance of a cumulative risk assessment of endocrine disruptors.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/jat.3601 PMID: 29460325
