Participantscompleted a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and laboratory testing forbiomarkers of inflammation [interleukin-6 (IL6)] prior to receiving systemictreatment for cancer. The primary outcome was poor physical performance, defined as scoring ≤7 on the Short Physical Performance Battery, Yes or No. Logisticregression analyses were undertaken.RESULTS: Among 135 women with mean age of 74.8 years (SD = 6.9), 31% wereAfrican-American (AA), and 33% had poor physical performance. Controlling forage, education, comorbidities and geriatric syndromes, participants with poorphysical performance were more likely to be AA [versus (vs.) Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW)], odds ratio (OR) = 3.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18-8.15.Controlling further for physical activity (PA) attenuated the racial disparity inphysical performance (OR = 2.50, CI = 0.91-6.84). Lastly, controlling for IL6further diminished the racial disparity in physical performance (OR = 1.93,CI = 0.67-5.56). In adjusted models, PA and IL6 explained 29% and 38%,respectively, of the racial disparity in poor physical performance.CONCLUSION: Among older women with newly diagnosed non-metastatic breast cancer, poor physical performance was prevalent and AA were disproportionately affected. Less engagement in physical activity and subclinical inflammation partlycontributed to this disparity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.jgo.2018.04.004 PMID: 29699938
