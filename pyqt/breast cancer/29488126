We analyzed SMNs in a large cohort withlong follow-up after breast conservation therapy.METHODS: The study population comprised 755 women with DCIS (n = 135) or stageI-II breast carcinoma (n = 620). Subjects were aged 25-89 (median 55) years when they underwent breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy to the entirebreast (60-68Gray) between 1992 and 2001. Additional treatment included hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy based on clinical characteristics. SMNs were grouped by site. The rate of SMNs over time was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method.To compare the probability of developing SMNs overall and for specific organs or sites, probability estimates were obtained for a 55-year-old female from theSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER).RESULTS: Median follow-up from radiotherapy was 13.8 years. The 15-yearage-adjusted probability of developing any SMN was 12.0%, close to the SEER rate of 12.1% for a non-breast malignancy. Systemic therapy and higher-doseradiotherapy (> 63 Gray) were not associated with significantly increased risksof SMNs. Compared to SEER, significantly increased risk was noted for gynecologiccancers and melanoma.CONCLUSIONS: Most SMNs were unrelated to treatment, and the 15-year incidence wassimilar to that of cancer in the SEER control group-findings that should bereassuring to patients. Further risk reduction is expected from prophylacticgynecologic surgery. Continued investigations into genetic links with melanomaare warranted.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4729-7 PMID: 29488126
