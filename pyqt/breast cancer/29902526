To be validated in a clinical context, a biomarker should satisfy some requirements including the ability to provide reliable information on apathological state by measuring its expression levels. In parallel, thedevelopment of an approach capable of detecting biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity would be ideally suited for clinical applications. Here, weperformed an immune-based label free assay using Surface Plasmon Resonance(SPR)-based detection of the soluble form of E-cadherin, a cell-cell contactprotein that is involved in the maintaining of tissue integrity. With thisapproach, we obtained a specific and quantitative detection of E-cadherin from a few hundred microliters of serum of breast cancer patients by obtaining a 10-foldenhancement in the detection limit over a traditional colorimetric ELISA.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
