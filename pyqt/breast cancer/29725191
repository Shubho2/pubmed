The SistasInspiring Sistas Through Activity and Support (SISTAS) Program was a one-yearrandomized controlled trial (RCT) to promote physical activity and healthy eatingamong AA women in SC to reduce inflammatory biomarkers, which are linked toincreased breast cancer (BrCa) risk and mortality. This study describes thedevelopment, recruitment, and implementation of the SISTAS clinical trial andprovides baseline characteristics of the study participants.Methods: SISTAS was developed using community-based participatory research (CBPR)approaches. At baseline, study participants completed assessments and underwentclinical measurements and blood draws to measure C-reactive protein (CRP) andinterleukin-6 (IL-6). Participants randomized to the intervention received 12weekly classes followed by nine monthly booster sessions. Post-interventionmeasurements were assessed at 12-week and 12-month follow-ups.Results: We recruited a total of 337 women who tended to: be middle-aged (meanage 48.2 years); have some college education; be employed full-time; haveMedicare as their primary insurance; be non-smokers; and perceive their personal health as good. On average, the women were pre-hypertensive at baseline (meansystolic blood pressure = 133.9 mm Hg; mean diastolic blood pressure = 84.0 mmHg) and morbidly obese (mean BMI >40.0 kg/m2); the mean fat mass and fat-freemass among participants were 106.4 lb and 121.0 lb, respectively.Conclusion: The SISTAS RCT addresses some of the gaps in the literature withrespect to CBPR interventions targeting AA women, such as implementing diet andphysical activity in CBPR-based studies to decrease BrCa risk.DOI: 10.18865/ed.28.2.75 PMCID: PMC5926857 [Available on 2018-10-26]PMID: 29725191
