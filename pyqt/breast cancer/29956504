[Epub aheadof print]The Improved Delivery to Breast Cancer Based on a Novel Nanocarrier Modified withHigh-Affinity Peptides Discovered by Phage Display.Zhang H(1), Guo Z(2), He B(1), Dai W(1), Zhang H(1), Wang X(1), Zhang Q(1).Author information: (1)State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of PharmaceuticalSciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.(2)School of Life Science and Medicine, Dalian University of Technology,Liaoning, 124221, China.Ligand-targeted nanosystems have the potential to realize site-specific tumortherapy and alleviate unwanted side effects of many chemotherapeutic agents, and one of the most key issues seems to be the construction of an effectivenanocarrier. Based on different processes of phage display techniques, 38cell-binding peptides and 32 cell-internalizing peptides are discovered. Four of these ligand peptides [FIPFDPMSMRWE (FIP), NASSFPTNSRWA (NAS), GLHTSATNLYLH(GLH), and ALAVAPSRWWNE (ALA), respectively] exhibit high affinity to MCF7 human breast cancer cells. Among them, NAS and ALA are reported for the first time,whose affinities are 20.6 and 76.3 times that of the random peptide control,respectively. Both NAS and ALA modifications to doxorubicin-loaded lipidnanosytems [LP(DOX)] show stronger tumor inhibition, longer animal survival time,and less body weight loss, compared to unmodified or control peptide modifiednanosystems, on an MCF7 tumor-bearing mouse model. In conclusion, thecell-binding peptide NAS and cell-internalizing peptide ALA can be used forligand-targeted delivery of antitumor drugs. It seems that the in vivo antitumor effect of these ligand-targeted nanosystems is closely related to theirligand-cell affinity, but fairly tolerant of the ligand types.Â© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
