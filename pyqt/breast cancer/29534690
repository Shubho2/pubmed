Fast growth is the important character of breast cancer, which makessure the subsequent metastasize and invasion breast cancer. Golgi related genesGOLPH3 has been reported to regulate many kinds of cancers proliferation.However, its upregulator remains largely unknown. miRNA modulate gene expression by post-transcriptional repression to participate in many signaling pathway ofbreast cancer cell proliferation. miR-590 has been reported to regulatetumorgenesis and could be regulated by its own target ATF-3. But whether miR-590 can be the modulator of Golgi related genes to regulate the breast cancerproliferation is unclear.METHODS: We performed the bioinformatics analysis of survival rate and expressiondifferences of patients using the data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).Both of MTS and BrdU assays were used for cell proliferation analysis. Cell cycle wasdetected by flow cytometry .qRT-PCR was used for detecting the cell cycle relatedgene expression. Student's t-test or One way anova was used for statistics.RESULTS: We found the upregulation of GOLPH3 in breast cancer samples comparedwith normal breast tissues, which also was related to the poor prognosis.Overexpression of GOLPH3 significantly promoted proliferation both of MDA-MB-231 cells (ER negative) and MCF-7 cells (ER positive). We further found thatmiRNA-590-3p could directly target the 3'-UTR of GOLPH3 mRNA to repress itsexpression. Overexpression of miR-590-3p inhibited the proliferation ofMDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. The rescue experiments indicated that overexpression of GOLPH3 significantly resorted the proliferation inhibited by miR-590-3p. Wealso found that ATF-3 repressed miR-590-3p expression to modulate miR-590/GOLPH3 pathway to regulate breast cancer cells proliferation.CONCLUSIONS: This study not only suggests that the ATF-3/miR-590/GOLPH3 signalingpathway is critically involved in the proliferation of breast cancer cells, butprovides a novel therapeutic target and new insight base on epigenetic regulationfor future breast cancer diagnosis and clinical treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4031-4 PMID: 29534690
