Epub 2018 Mar 18.The Protein Extract of Chlorella minutissima Inhibits The Expression of MMP-1,MMP-2 and MMP-9 in Cancer Cells through Upregulation of TIMP-3 and DownRegulation of c-Jun.Kunte M(1), Desai K(2).Author information: (1)Department of Biological Sciences, NMIMS University, Vile Parle (W), Mumbai,India.(2)Department of Microbiology, Mithibai College, Vile Parle (W), Mumbai,India.Electronic address: krutika.desai@mithibai.ac.in.OBJECTIVES: Considering the bioactivities exhibited by microalgae, the effect of protein extract of Chlorella minutissimma (CP extract) was investigated on theexpression of human matrix metalloproteinases-1 (MMP-1) in the breast cancer cellline MDA-MB231, and that of MMP-2 and -9 in hepatocellular cancer cell line HepG2at different expression levels. The study aimed identification and analysis ofinhibitory activity of microalgal components extracted from Chlorella minutissimaagainst human MMPs.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, we analysed the effect ofChlorella extracts on MMP-1, -2, and -9 expression at various levels. Gelatinzymography was performed to study the inhibitory effect of Chlorella exracts onhuman gelatinases at the activity level, followed by western blotting to analyse the expression of all three MMPs at the protein level. The similar effect at the mRNA level along with the probable mechanism underlying inhibition of MMPs wasassessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).RESULTS: The results reveal that the treatment with CP extract decreased the mRNAexpression of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 by 0.26-, 0.29-, and 0.40-fold,respectively, at 20 μg/ml concentration as well as inhibited the activity ofMMP-2 and MMP-9 by 37.56 and 42.64%, respectively, at 15 μg/ml concentration.Additionally, upregulated mRNA expression of tissue inhibitor ofmetalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) by 1.68-fold was seen in HepG2 cells at 20 μg/mlconcentration treatment group. However, CP extract did not induce any change inthe mRNA expression of the TIMP-1, -2 and -4 in HepG2 and TIMP-1, -2, -3 and -4in MDA-MB231 cells. Activator protein-1 (AP-1)-dependent c-Jun-mediatedtranscriptional regulation of MMP-1, -2, and -9 was also studied to elucidate theappropriate mechanism involved in the inhibition of MMPs.CONCLUSIONS: The CP extract successfully inhibited MMP-1, -2, and -9 at differentexpression levels through TIMP-3 upregulation and c-Jun downregulation.Copyright© by Royan Institute.
