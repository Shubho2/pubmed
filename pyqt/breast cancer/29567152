An increasing number of datasuggested that miRNA-21 could be identified as diagnostic and therapeuticbiomarker for breast cancer. Meanwhile, inhibiting the function of miRNA-21,resulting in cells growth inhibition and apoptotic cells death. To realizemiRNA-21detection and inhibition to diagnostic and therapeutic breast cancercells, we developed gold nanoparticle-based 2'-O-methyl modified DNA probes(AuNP-2'-OMe-DNA probes) for diagnostic and therapeutic breast cancer. Goldnanoparticles were functionalized with chemically modified miRNA-21 inhibitor to suppress the function of miRNA-21 for the therapeutic breast cancer, at the same time, fluorophore-labeled DNA molecules were hybridized with antimiRNA-21 fordiagnostic breast cancer. The results showed that the 2'-O-methyl modified DNAcan improve stability, increase binding affinity to target strands and enhancethe therapeutic effects. The experimental results also demonstrated thatantimiR-21 were efficiently introduced into the cells and knocked down miRNA-21to inhibit its function, leading to growth inhibition and apoptotic cells death. We prospected that chemically modified miRNA-21 inhibitor based on goldnanoparticles would be as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic platform forbreast cancer clinically.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
