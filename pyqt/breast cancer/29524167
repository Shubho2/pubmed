Methylation of promoter CpG islands represents an alternative mechanism to inactivate DNA repair andtumour suppressor genes. In our study, we analyzed the frequency of methylationchanges of 24 tumour suppressor genes and explored their association withBRCAness profile. BRCA1ness profile and aberrant methylation were studied in 233 fresh frozen breast tumour tissues by Multiplex Ligation-dependent ProbeAmplification (MLPA) and Methylation Specific (MS)-MLPA methods, respectively.Our analyses revealed that 12.4% of the breast cancer (BC) patients had tumourswith a BRCA1ness profile. TIMP3 showed significantly higher (p = 5.8х10-5)methylation frequency in tumours with BRCA1ness, while methylation of APC, GSTP1 and RASSF1 promoters was negatively associated with BRCA1ness (р = 0.0017,р = 0.007 and р = 0.046, respectively). TIMP3 methylation was also associatedwith triple negative (TN) BC. Furthermore, TN tumours showing BRCA1ness showedstronger association with TIMP3 methylation (p = 0.0008) in comparison to TNtumours without BRCA1ness (p = 0.009). In conclusion, we confirmed that TIMP3methylation is a marker for TN tumours and furthermore we showed for the firsttime that TIMP3 promoter methylation is an epigenetic marker of BRCA1nesstumours.DOI: 10.1007/s12253-018-0398-4 PMID: 29524167
