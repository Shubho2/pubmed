We aimed toidentify barriers to screening and potential solutions in this population. Amixed-methods study involving a retrospective chart review and focus groupinterviews was conducted, with data analyzed using univariate logistic regressionand thematic analysis, respectively. Mammography completion was associated withgreater time in Canada (p = 0.01) and region of origin (p = 0.04), while FOBTcompletion was associated with region of origin (p = 0.03). Barriers includedtime constraints, language and cultural differences, and poor interprofessionalcommunication. This study of recent immigrants and refugees identifies barriersto screening and supports potential solutions including culturally-congruent peerworkers, targeted screening workshops, and visual screening aids. Further work isneeded to address the unique healthcare needs of this diverse and growingpopulation.DOI: 10.1007/s10903-018-0779-5 PMID: 29968004
