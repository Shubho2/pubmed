Tucatinib is an oral, potent, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2)-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) being developed as a noveltreatment for ERBB2/HER2-positive breast cancer.Objective: To determine the maximum tolerated dosage of tucatinib in combination with T-DM1 in the treatment of patients with ERBB2/HER2-positive metastaticbreast cancer with and without brain metastases.Design, Setting, and Participants: In this phase 1b open-label, multicenter,clinical trial, 57 participants enrolled between January 22, 2014, and June 22,2015, were 18 years of age or older with ERBB2/HER2-positive metastatic breastcancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. Data were analyzedbetween January and March 2018.Interventions: Tucatinib 300 mg or 350 mg administered orally twice per day for21 days and T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg administered intravenously once every 21 days.Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety assessments, pharmacokinetics, and responsewere assessed using RECIST 1.1 every 2 cycles for 6 cycles, followed by every 3cycles.Results: Fifty-seven T-DM1-naive patients (median [IQR] 51 [44.0-63.0] years ofage) who had undergone a median of 2 earlier HER2 therapies (range, 1-3) weretreated. The tucatinib maximum tolerated dosage was determined to be 300 mgadministered twice per day with dose-limiting toxic reactions seen at 350 mgtwice per day. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there was no drug-druginteraction with T-DM1. Adverse events seen among the 50 patients treated at the maximum tolerated dosage regardless of causality included nausea (36 patients;72%), diarrhea (30 patients; 60%), fatigue (28 patients; 56%), epistaxis (22patients; 44%), headache (22 patients; 44%), vomiting (21 patients; 42%),constipation (21 patients; 42%), and decreased appetite (20 patients; 40%); themajority of adverse events were grade 1 or 2. Tucatinib-related toxic reactionsthat were grade 3 and above included thrombocytopenia (7 patients; 14%) andhepatic transaminitis (6 patients; 12%).Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, tucatinib in combination with T-DM1appeared to have acceptable toxicity and to show preliminary antitumor activityamong heavily pretreated patients with ERBB2/HER2-positive metastatic breastcancer with and without brain metastases.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01983501.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.1812 PMID: 29955792
