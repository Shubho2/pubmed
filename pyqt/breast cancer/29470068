Wehave recently proposed the development of peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) usingagonistic EphA2-targeting agents, such as the YSA peptide or its optimizedversion, 123B9. Although our studies indicated that YSA- and 123B9-drugconjugates can selectively deliver cytotoxic drugs to cancer cells in vivo, therelatively low cellular agonistic activities (i.e., the high micromolarconcentrations required) of the agents toward the EphA2 receptor remained alimiting factor to the further development of these PDCs in the clinic. Here, we report that a dimeric version of 123B9 can induce receptor activation atnanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the conjugation ofdimeric 123B9 with paclitaxel is very effective at targeting circulating tumorcells and inhibiting lung metastasis in breast-cancer models. These studiesrepresent an important step toward the development of effective EphA2-targetingPDCs.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01837 PMCID: PMC5907794 [Available on 2019-02-22]PMID: 29470068
