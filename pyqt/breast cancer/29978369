Several clinical trials have shown that sentinellymph node (SLN) surgery after NAC is feasible for these patients. We sought toevaluate the use of SLN surgery and ALND in cN1 patients undergoing NAC.METHODS: We identified all patients with biopsy-proven cN1 breast cancer treated with NAC at our institution between January 2009 and December 2017. Approximated biologic subtype was determined by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. Cochran-Armitage trend and Chi squaretests were used for statistical analysis.RESULTS: Of 430 cN1 patients treated with NAC, 93 (22%) underwent SLN surgeryonly, 100 (23%) underwent SLN and ALND, and 237 (55%) underwent ALND only. Theuse of SLN surgery (± ALND) increased from 28% in 2009 to 86% in 2017(p < 0.001), while the performance of ALND decreased from 100% in 2009 to 38% in 2017 (p < 0.001). Among SLN+ patients who underwent ALND, disease was limited to the SLNs in 25/73 (34%) patients. The nodal pathologic complete response rate was46% and varied by tumor subtype (p < 0.001). Among patients undergoing SLNsurgery, ALND was avoided in 48% of patients overall and varied by biologicsubtype: 55% ER-/HER2+, 61% ER+/HER2+, 62% ER-/HER2-, and 31% ER+/HER2-(p = 0.001). With short-term follow-up, no nodal recurrences have occurred inpatients without ALND.CONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant shift in axillary surgery for cN1 breastcancer patients treated with NAC, with increasing use of SLN surgery to assessnodal treatment response, and decreasing use of ALND.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6637-9 PMID: 29978369
