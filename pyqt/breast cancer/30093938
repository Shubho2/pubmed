The prognosis of patients with TX stage remains unclear. Theaim of this study was to investigate the prognosis of TX stage and provide aperspective on treatment guidelines. We investigated a large cohort of DTCpatients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between2004 and 2013. Patient mortality was examined by Kaplan-Meier analyses withlog-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. The rate ofcancer-specific mortality per 1000 person-years for patients with TX stage washigher than for patients with T1-T3 stage, but lower than for patients with T4stage. The all-cause mortality per 1000 person-years for TX stage patients wasalso higher than for T1-T3 stage patients, but lower than for T4 stage patients. TX stage showed significant risk for cancer-specific mortality compared to T1 andT4 stages, but not T2 and T3 stages, after adjusting for influential riskfactors. TX stage patients showed no significant risk for all-cause mortalitycompared to T2-T3 stage patients, but were different than T1 and T4 stagepatients. These results provide new implications for the treatment of TX stageDTC patients.PMID: 30093938
