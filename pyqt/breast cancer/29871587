Rhodiola crenulata extracts displayanti-neoplastic properties against several cancers including breast cancer,melanoma, and glioblastoma. In this study, we evaluated the anti-neoplasticpotential of Rhodiola crenulata extracts on human neuroblastoma cells. Throughthis work, cell viability and proliferation were evaluated following treatmentswith ethanol (vehicle control) or Rhodiola crenulata extract in neuroblastoma,NB-1691 or SK-N-AS cells, in vitro. HIF-1 transcriptional activity was evaluated using a dual luciferase assay. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactionwas utilized to assess the expression of HIF-1 targets. Selected metabolicintermediates were evaluated for their ability to rescue cells from Rhodiolacrenulata extract-induced death. Lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, andpyruvate dehydrogenase activities and NAD+/NADH levels were assayed in vehicleand Rhodiola crenulata extract-treated cells. The effects of Rhodiola crenulataextracts on metabolism were assessed by respirometry and metabolicphenotyping/fingerprinting. Our results revealed striking cytotoxic effects upon Rhodiola crenulata extract treatment, especially prominent in NB-1691 cells. As agreater response was observed in NB-1691 cells therefore it was used forremaining experiments. Upon Rhodiola crenulata extract treatment, HIF-1transcriptional activity was increased. This increase in activity correlated withchanges in HIF-1 targets involved in cellular metabolism. Serendipitously, weobserved that addition of pyruvate protected against the cytotoxic effects ofRhodiola crenulata extracts. Therefore, we focused on the metabolic effects ofRhodiola crenulata extracts on NB-1691 cells. We observed that while theactivities of pyruvate kinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities wereincreased, the activity of lactate dehydrogenase activity was decreased uponRhodiola crenulata extract treatment. We also noted a decline in the total NADpool following Rhodiola crenulata extract treatment. This correlated withdecreased cellular respiration and suppressed utilization of carbon substrates.Through this work, we observed significant cytotoxic effects of Rhodiolacrenulata extract treatment upon treatment on NB-1691 cells, a humanneuroblastoma cell line with MYCN amplification. Our studies suggest that thesecytotoxic effects could be secondary to metabolic effect induced by treatmentwith Rhodiola crenulata extract.DOI: 10.1177/1010428318779515 PMID: 29871587  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
