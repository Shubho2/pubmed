In vivo dosimetric screening is essential in this environment toavoid important dosimetric errors. This work examines the feasibility ofintroducing in vivo dosimetry (IVD) checks in a radiotherapy routine. The causes of dosimetric disagreements between delivered and planned treatments wereidentified and corrected during the course of treatment. The efficiency of thecorrections performed and the added workload needed for the entire procedure wereevaluated. The IVD procedure was based on an electronic portal imaging device. A total of 3682 IVD tests were performed for 147 patients who underwent head andneck, abdomen, pelvis, breast, and thorax radiotherapy treatments. Two types ofindices were evaluated and used to determine if the IVD tests were withintolerance levels: the ratio R between the reconstructed and planned isocentredoses and a transit dosimetry based on the Î³-analysis of the electronic portalimages. The causes of test outside tolerance level were investigated andcorrected and IVD test was repeated during subsequent fraction. The time neededfor each step of the IVD procedure was registered. Pelvis, abdomen, and head and neck treatments had 10% of tests out of tolerance whereas breast and thoraxtreatments accounted for up to 25%. The patient setup was the main cause of 90%of the IVD tests out of tolerance and the remaining 10% was due to patientmorphological changes. An average time of 42 min per day was sufficient tomonitor a daily workload of 60 patients in treatment. This work shows that IVDperformed with an electronic portal imaging device is feasible in an overloadeddepartment and enables the timely realignment of the treatment quality indices inorder to achieve a patient's final treatment compliant with the one prescribed.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0192686 PMCID: PMC5809064PMID: 29432473  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
