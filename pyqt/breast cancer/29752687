We initiated a prospective clinical trial to evaluate whether bisphosphonates are associatedwith reduced incidence of AIMSS.METHODS: In the single-arm trial, the Zoledronic Acid Prophylaxis (ZAP) trial, wecompared the incidence of AIMSS against historical controls from the Exemestaneand Letrozole Pharmacogenomics (ELPh) trial. Eligible women were postmenopausalwith stage 0-III breast cancer planning to receive adjuvant AIs. AIMSS wasassessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire and Visual Analog Scale over12 months in both trials. Participants in the ZAP trial received zoledronic acid prior to initiating letrozole and after 6 months; ELPh participants included inthe analysis were taking letrozole but not bisphosphonates. We analyzedpatient-reported outcomes (PROs) and bone density in the ZAP trial usingmixed-effects linear regression models and paired t tests, respectively.RESULTS: From 2011 to 2013, 59 postmenopausal women enrolled in ZAP trial. All 59(100%) women received baseline and 52 (88%) received 6-month zoledronic acid, andhad similar characteristics to historical controls from the ELPh trial (n = 206).Cumulatively during the first year of AI, 37 and 67% of ZAP and ELPh participantsreported AIMSS (p < 0.001), respectively. Within the ZAP trial, we did notobserve significant changes in other PROs; however, we report improvements inbone mineral density.CONCLUSIONS: Compared to historical controls, zoledronic acid administeredconcomitantly with adjuvant AIs was associated with a reduced incidence of AIMSS.A randomized controlled trial is required to confirm these findings.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4811-1 PMID: 29752687
