Chemokines have chemoattractant potential for cancer metastasis. Here,we investigated the chemokine signatures in BC subtypes and the underlyingmechanisms that enhance proinflammatory chemokines in TNBC. Analysis frommicroarray dataset revealed that basal-like BC subtype including TNBC expresseddominantly proinflammatory chemokines, such as CXCL1 and 8, compared to non-TNBC.Chemokine PCR array confirmed the dominant chemokines in TNBC cells. To identify a driving factor for proinflammatory chemokines in TNBC cells, we determined the expression and signaling profiles of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)family members. TNBC cells expressed higher levels of EGFR and phosphorylatedAkt/Erk than non-TNBC cells. In addition, EGF further enhanced theproinflammatory chemokines in TNBC cells, including CXCL2. Knockdown of Aktreduced the CXCL2 promoter activity, while overexpression of Akt enhanced it.MK2206, an Akt inhibitor, reduced the CXCL2 promoter activity, while inhibitionand knockdown of Erk did not reduce its activity. We found that transforminggrowth factor alpha (TGFα) could serve as a main ligand for EGFR to driveEGFR-mediated Akt activation in TNBC cells. MK2206 decreased TGFα promoteractivity, while overexpression of Akt increased it. MK2206 also reduced TGFαrelease from TNBC cells. Moreover, MK2206 downregulated CXCL2 mRNA expression,while TGFα upregulated it. Taken together, the TGFα-EGFR-Akt signaling axis canplay a role in enhancing proinflammatory chemokine expression in TNBC,subsequently contributing to the inflammatory burden that ultimately lead tocancer progression and a higher mortality rate among TNBC patients.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25389 PMCID: PMC6047672PMID: 30034618
