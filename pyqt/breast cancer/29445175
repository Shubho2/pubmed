However, few autophagy inhibitors are currently approved for clinical application in humans. Berbamine (BBM) is a natural compoundextracted from traditional Chinese medicine that is widely used for treatment of a variety of diseases without any obvious side effects. Here we found that BBM isa novel auophagy inhibitor, which potently induced the accumulation ofautophagosomes by inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion in human breast cancercells. Mechanistically, we found that BBM blocked autophagosome-lysosome fusionby inhibiting the interaction of SNAP29 and VAMP8. Furthermore, BBM inducedupregulation of BNIP3 and the interaction between SNAP29 and BNIP3. BNIP3depletion or SNAP29 overexpression abrogated BBM-mediated blockade ofautophagosome-lysosome fusion through the interaction between SNAP29 and VAMP8,whereas BNIP3 overexpression blocked autophagosome-lysosome fusion throughinhibition of the interaction between SNAP29 and VAMP8. These findings suggestthat upregulation of BNIP3 and interaction between BNIP3 and SNAP29 could beinvolved in BBM-mediated blockade of autophagosome-lysosome fusion throughinhibition of the interaction between SNAP29 and VAMP8. Our findings identify thecritical role of BNIP3 in blockade of autophagosome-lysosome fusion mediated byBBM, and suggest that BBM could potentially be further developed as a novelautophagy inhibitor, which could enhance the effect of chemotherapy to cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0276-8 PMCID: PMC5833711PMID: 29445175
