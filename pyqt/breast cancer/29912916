However, the nature of itsinvolvement in control of these oncogenic processes is incompletely understood.In the present study, we investigate the role of Malat1 and the effects of Malat1KO in a breast cancer cell model. Our selection of Malat1 as the subject ofinquiry followed initial screening experiments seeking to identify lncRNAs which are altered in the presence or absence of Nischarin, a gene of interestpreviously discovered by our lab. Nischarin is a well characterized tumorsuppressor protein and actively represses cell proliferation, migration, andinvasion in breast cancer. Our microarray screen for lncRNAs revealed multiplelncRNAs to be significantly elevated in cells ectopically expressing Nischarincompared to control cancer cells, which have only marginal Nisch expression.Using these cells, we assess how the link between Nischarin and Malat1 affectscancer cell function, finding that Malat1 confers an inhibitory effect on cellgrowth and migration which is lost following Malat1 KO, but in a Nisch-dependent context. Specifically, Malat1 KO in the background of low Nischarin expressionhad a limited effect on cell functions, while Malat1 KO in cells with high levelsof Nischarin led to significant increases in cell proliferation and migration. Insummary, this project provides further clarity concerning the function of Malat1,specifically in breast cancer, while also indicating that the Nischarinexpression context is an important factor in the determining how Malat1 activity is governed in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198945 PMCID: PMC6005468PMID: 29912916
