China.Cisplatin is used for the treatment of a range of solid malignant tumors;however, with prolonged treatment durations, the sensitivity of tumor cells tothe drug decreases owing to an unclear mechanism of drug resistance. The present study aimed to investigate whether breast-cancer-tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BC-MSCs) are involved in mediating the effects of cisplatin on breastcancer cells, and which component of the BC-MSC conditioned medium (BC-MSC-CM)exhibited an anti-apoptotic effect. Cytokines/chemokines in BC-MSC-CM werequantified using a Luminex immunoassay, and reverse transcription-quantitativepolymerase chain reaction analysis detected interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in MCF-7 cells following different treatments. MTT and flow cytometry analysis measuredcell vitality and apoptosis, respectively, and activation of signal transducedand activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was evaluated by western blotting.BC-MSCs reversed the pro-apoptotic effect of cisplatin and enhanced theproliferation of MCF-7 cells more potently than bone-marrow-derived MSCs. Furtherstudy revealed that BC-MSCs secreted IL-6 to protect MCF-7 cells from apoptosisand promote their survival. Neutralizing IL-6 with a specific antibody partially inhibited the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway and reversed the promoter role ofBC-MSCs in MCF-7 cells. Taken together, the findings of the present studyindicated that BC-MSCs decreased the level of cisplatin-induced apoptosis inMCF-7 cells by activating the IL-6/STAT3 pathway in cancer cells. BC-MSCs, asimportant cells in the tumor microenvironment, have a key role in the treatmentof breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8463 PMCID: PMC5958889PMID: 29844821
