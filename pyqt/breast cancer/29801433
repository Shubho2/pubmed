If each of these methods produces different numbers of clusters for the same data, it is difficultto achieve an optimal solution. Here, we introduce "polyClustR", a tool thatreconciles clusters identified by different methods into subtype "communities"using a hypergeometric test or a measure of relative proportion of commonsamples.RESULTS: The polyClustR pipeline was initially tested using a breast cancerdataset to demonstrate how results are compatible with and add to theunderstanding of this well-characterised cancer. Two uveal melanoma datasets werethen utilised to identify and validate novel subtype communities with significantmetastasis-free prognostic differences and associations with known chromosomalaberrations.CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the value of the polyClustR approach of applyingmultiple consensus clustering algorithms and systematically reconciling theresults in identifying novel subtype communities of two cancer types, whichnevertheless are compatible with established understanding of these diseases.
