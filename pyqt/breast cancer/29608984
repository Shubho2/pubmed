Herein, we describe that using low dose of the multikinaseinhibitor sorafenib improves cyclophosphamide antitumor activity by inhibitingangiogenesis, metastasis and promoting tumor healing in MDA-MB231 xenografts and the 4T1-12B syngeneic breast cancer metastasis model. Mechanistic studies inMDA-MB231 cells revealed that alkylation upregulates inflammatory genes/proteins such as COX-2, IL8, CXCL2 and MMP1 in a MEK1/2-ERK1/2-dependent manner. Theseproteins enrich the secretome of cancer cells, stimulating cell invasion andangiogenesis via autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Sorafenib inhibitsMEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway thereby decreasing inflammatory genes and mitigating cellinvasion and angiogenesis at basal and alkylation-induced conditions whereas NRF2and ER stress pathways involved in alkylation survival are not affected. Innon-invasive/non-angiogenic breast cancer cells (SKBR3 and MCF7), alkylation did not elicit inflammatory responses with the only sorafenib effect beingERK1/2-independent ROS-dependent cytotoxicity when using higher drugconcentrations. In summary, our data show that alkylating agents may elicitinflammatory responses that seems to contribute to malignant progression inspecific breast cancer cells. Identifying and targeting drivers of this phenotypemay offer opportunities to optimize combined drug regimens between classicalchemotherapeutics and targeted agents.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
