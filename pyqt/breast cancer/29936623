Due to the inherent bias of such evaluation, screeningand treatment for cancer-related fatigue remains suboptimal. The purpose is toevaluate whether objective cancer patients' hand muscle mechanical parameters(maximal force, critical force, force variability) extracted from a fatiguinghandgrip exercise may be correlated to the different dimensions (physical,emotional, and cognitive) of cancer-related fatigue.METHODS: Fourteen women with advanced breast cancer, still under or havingpreviously received chemotherapy within the preceding 3 months, and 11 healthywomen participated to the present study. Cancer-related fatigue was firstassessed through the EORTC QLQ-30 and its fatigue module. Fatigability was thenmeasured during 60 maximal repeated handgrip contractions. The maximum force,critical force (asymptote of the force-time evolution), and force variability(root mean square of the successive differences) were extracted. Multipleregression models were performed to investigate the influence of the forceparameters on cancer-related fatigue's dimensions.RESULTS: The multiple linear regression analysis evidenced that physical fatigue was best explained by maximum force and critical force (r = 0.81; p = 0.029). Theemotional fatigue was best explained by maximum force, critical force, and force variability (r = 0.83; p = 0.008). The cognitive fatigue was best explained bycritical force and force variability (r = 0.62; p = 0.035).CONCLUSION: The handgrip maximal force, critical force, and force variability mayoffer objective measures of the different dimensions of cancer-related fatigueand could provide a complementary approach to the patient reported outcomes.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4320-0 PMID: 29936623
