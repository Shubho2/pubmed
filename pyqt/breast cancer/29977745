Considering that the strategyof the treatment is determined by the histological type of the tumor,practitioners should be alert in order to avoid malpractices in cases of multiplemetachronous or synchronous malignancies. In this article we report two rarecases of MPMN. The first patient suffered from three metachronous malignantneoplasms, specifically tonsillar, lung and breast cancer, while the secondpatient was diagnosed with four synchronous and metachronous malignant tumors,including renal and lung cancer, basaloid carcinoma and melanoma. Such cases are extremely rare in the clinical practice and poorly described in the literature.DOI: 10.1016/j.rmcr.2018.03.006 PMCID: PMC6010593PMID: 29977745
