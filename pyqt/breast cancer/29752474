Mounting evidence indicates that Checkpointsuppressor 1 (CHES1) is tightly associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis inmany types of cancer. However, the definitive function of CHES1 in breast cancer remains to be explored. Here we showed that CHES1 had a physical interaction withestrogen receptor-α (ERα) and repressed the transactivation of ERα in breastcancer cells. Mechanistically, the interaction between CHES1 and ERα enhanced therecruitment of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) deacetylase Sirtuin 1(SIRT1), and it further induced SIRT1-mediated ERα deacetylation and repressionon the promoter-binding enrichment of ERα. In addition, we also found that theexpression of CHES1 was repressed by estrogen-ERα signaling and the expressionlevel of CHES1 was significantly downregulated in ERα-positive breast cancer. Thedetailed mechanism was that ERα may directly bind to CHES1 potential promoter viarecognizing the conserved estrogen response element (ERE) motif in response toestrogen stimulation. Functionally, CHES1 inhibited ERα-mediated proliferationand tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. Totally, theseresults identified a negative cross-regulatory loop between ERα and CHES1 thatwas required for growth of breast cancer cells, it might uncover novel insightinto molecular mechanism of CHES1 involved in breast cancer and provide newavenues for molecular-targeted therapy in hormone-regulated breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0629-3 PMCID: PMC5948204PMID: 29752474
