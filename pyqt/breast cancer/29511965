Given the lack of clinically validated BC biomarkers, obesity and weight-loss studies utilize serum biomarkers as the intermediary outcomes of tumor recurrence. Studies have indicated microRNAs (miRNA)s are reliablebiomarkers for cancer. We hypothesized that miRNA expression correlates withobesity and weight loss amongst BC survivors. This would yield insight into thebiological pathways by which this association occurs, enabling more precisedevelopment of therapeutics.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We correlated baseline body mass index (BMI) with serummiRNA expression in 121 BC survivors enrolled in the Hormones and PhysicalExercise (HOPE) trial. We then analyzed expression of the 35 most abundant miRNAsfrom HOPE in a six-month randomized controlled weight-loss trial (Lifestyle,Exercise, and Nutrition; LEAN) in 100 BC survivors. Ingenuity pathway analysis(IPA) software was used to identify biological pathway targets of theBMI-associated and intervention-responsive miRNAs using predictive biomarkers.RESULTS: Pearson correlations in HOPE identified eight miRNAs associated withBMI, including miR-191-5p (r = - 0.22, p = 0.016) and miR-122-5p (r = 0.25,p = 0.0048). In the LEAN validation study, levels of miR-191-5p significantlyincreased during the six-month intervention (p = 0.082). Ingenuity PathwayAnalysis identified "Estrogen-mediated S-phase entry" (HOPE p = 0.003; LEANp < 0.001) and "Molecular mechanisms of cancer" (HOPE p = 0.02; LEAN p < 0.001)as the top canonical pathways that significantly correlated with BMI-associatedand intervention-responsive miRNAs and contain obesity and cancer-relevant genes including the E2F family of transcription factors and CCND1, which have beenimplicated in sporadic BC.CONCLUSION: While the association between obesity and BC recurrence and mortalityhas been demonstrated in the literature, mechanisms underlying the link betweenweight gain and cancer are unclear. Using two independent clinical trials, weidentified novel miRNAs associative to BMI and weight loss that contribute to thedevelopment of cancer. Predictive modeling of miRNA targets identified multiplecanonical pathways associated with cancer, highlighting potential mechanismsexplaining the link between BMI and increased cancer risk.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4738-6 PMID: 29511965
