Although TNBC is sensitive tochemotherapy, the overall outcomes of TNBC are worse than for other breastcancers, and TNBC is still one of the most fatal diseases for women. With thediscovery of antigens specifically expressed in TNBC cells and the developingtechnology of monoclonal antibodies, chimeric antigen receptors and cancervaccines, immunotherapy is emerging as a novel promising option for TNBC. Thisreview is mainly focused on the tumour microenvironment and host immunity, TripleNegative Breast Cancer and the clinical treatment of TNBC, novel therapies forcancer and immunotherapy for TNBC, and the future outlook for the treatment forTNBC and the interplay between the therapies, including immune checkpointinhibitors, combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted treatments in TNBC, adoptive cell therapy, cancer vaccines. The review also highlightsrecent reports on the synergistic effects of immunotherapy and chemotherapy,antibody-drug conjugates, and exosomes, as potential multifunctional therapeutic agents in TNBC.DOI: 10.1186/s12967-018-1514-7 PMCID: PMC5977468PMID: 29848327
