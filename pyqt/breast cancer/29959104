Electronic address: xluo@celgene.com.BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agencyhave published guidance for industry on the use of pathologic complete response(pCR) as a surrogate endpoint to accelerate the regulatory approval ofneoadjuvant agents in high-risk early-stage breast cancer (EBC). Threemeta-analyses, the CTNeoBC consortium (Cortazar 2014), Berruti (2014), and Korn(2016), evaluated the association between the pCR odds ratio and the eventhazards ratio but did not identify strong trial-level associations. Thus,uncertainties remain with respect to whether the magnitude of effect-sizeincrease in pCR reasonably predicts long-term clinical benefit.FINDINGS: Trial-level data from CTNeoBC were used as the training data set toderive an empirical nonlinear model for predicting long-term outcomes based onpCR results. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate the relationship amongtreatments, event hazards, and pCR as joint covariates. The trial-levelassociation between treatment and event hazard was derived and then linked withpCR rates. Magnitude of the patient-level association was also included in theanalysis. Additional published trials were used to validate the predictive model.Numerical differences between the perfect surrogate prediction and observedeffect followed normal distribution based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Forevent-free survival (EFS), the Student t-test P value of 0.02 suggested astatistically significant nonzero difference, with a mean value of -0.163 (SE0.058). For overall survival (OS), the Student t-test P value of 0.0027 suggesteda statistically significant nonzero difference, with a mean value of -0.153 (SE0.038). Three studies, including GeparSixto, BOOG, and Neo-tAnGo, were used forvalidation. The F test suggested the model fit the test data well.IMPLICATIONS: The observed hazard ratios fit well with the predicted hazardratios for both EFS and OS and suggest plausible trial-level associations withthe new predictor.MAJOR FINDINGS: Our model predicted the correlation between pCR and EFS as wellas OS. This model could be used as a supporting tool to help interpret positivepCR results in neoadjuvant clinical studies in patients with high-risk EBC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
