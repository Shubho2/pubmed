During metastasis, cancer cellsaberrantly express several glycans that are correlated with poor patient outcome.This study was aimed toward exploring the effects of O-GlcNAcylation onmembranous N-glycans that are associated with the progression ofcholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Global O-GlcNAcylation in CCA cells was depleted using specific siRNA against O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which transfers GlcNAc to the acceptor proteins. Using an HPLC-Chip/Time-of-Flight (Chip/TOF) MS system, theN-glycans associated with O-GlcNAcylation were identified by comparing themembranous N-glycans of siOGT-treated cells with those of scramble siRNA-treated cells. In parallel, the membranous N-glycans of the parental cells (KKU-213 andKKU-214) were compared with those of the highly metastatic cells (KKU-213L5 andKKU-214L5). Together, these data revealed that high mannose (Hex9HexNAc2) andbiantennary complex (Hex5HexNAc4Fuc1NeuAc1) N-linked glycans correlatedpositively with metastasis. We subsequently demonstrate that suppression ofO-GlcNAcylation decreased the expression of these two N-glycans, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation mediates their levels in CCA. In addition, the ability of highly metastatic cells to migrate and invade was reduced by the presence of PisumSativum Agglutinin (PSA), a mannose-specific lectin, further indicating theassociation of high mannose type N-glycans with CCA metastasis. The molecularmechanism of O-GlcNAc-mediated progression of CCA was shown to proceed via aseries of signaling events, involving the activation of Akt/Erk (i), an increase in FOXO3 phosphorylation (ii), which results in the reduction of MAN1A1expression (iii) and thus the accumulation of Hex9HexNAc2 N-glycans (iv). Thisstudy demonstrates for the first time the association between O-GlcNAcylation,high mannose type N-glycans, and the progression of CCA metastasis, suggesting a novel therapeutic target for treatment of metastatic CCA.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0366-1 PMID: 29915392
