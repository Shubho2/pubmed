However, not all of these patients had nonsentinel lymph nodemetastasis on final histology. Some predicting models have been developed forcalculating the risk of nonsentinel lymph node metastasis. The aim of our studywas to validate some of the predicting models in a Chinese population.METHOD: Two hundred thirty-six patients with positive sentinel lymph node andcomplete axillary lymph node dissection were included. Patients were applied to 6models for evaluation of the risk of nonsentinel lymph node involvement. Thereceiver-operating characteristic curves were shown in our study. The calculationof area under the curves and false negative rate was done for each model toassess the discriminative power of the models.RESULTS: There are 105 (44.5%) patients who had metastatic nonsentinel lymphnode(s) in our population. Primary tumor size, the number of metastatic sentinel lymph node, and the proportion of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes/total sentinel lymph nodes were identified as the independent predictors of nonsentinel lymphnode metastasis. The Seoul National University Hospital and Louisville scoringsystem outperformed the others, with area under the curves of 0.706 and 0.702,respectively. The area under the curve values were 0.677, 0.673, 0.432, and 0.674for the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Tenon, Stanford, and ShanghaiCancer Hospital models, respectively. With adjusted cutoff points, the Louisvillescoring system outperformed the others by classifying 26.51% of patients withbreast cancer to the low-risk group.CONCLUSION: The Louisville and Seoul National University Hospital scoring system were found to be more predictive among the 6 models when applied to the Chinesepatients with breast cancer in our database. Models developed at otherinstitutions should be used cautiously for decision-making regarding completeaxillary lymph node dissection after a positive biopsy in sentinel lymph node.DOI: 10.1177/1533033818785032 PMCID: PMC6055247PMID: 30033828
