The mesonephrosdevelops from the intermediate mesoderm and forms tubules that are segmented in asimilar way to the nephrons of the permanent kidney (but lacking loops of Henle).Early studies have suggested that the mesonephros in marsupials and someplacental mammals may perform an excretory function, but these studies have notdirectly shown active transport of organic anions and cations. Excretory functionin the rodent mesonephros has not been investigated. Functional characterization of the earliest stages of mammalian renal development is important for ourunderstanding of congenital disease and may help to inform the growing field ofrenal tissue engineering. Here, we use live uptake and efflux assays in vitro to show that the murine mesonephros is able to transport organic anions and cations through specific transporters from early in its development. Transcript analysis suggests that there are subtle differences between the transporters involved inuptake and efflux by the murine permanent metanephric tubules and by themesonephric tubules. These data suggest that the mammalian mesonephros canprovide an excretory function for the early developing embryo, in addition to theexcretory function provided by the placenta.DOI: 10.1152/ajprenal.00021.2018 PMID: 29561184
