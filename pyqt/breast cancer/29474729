[Epub ahead of print]The science of peer support as applied to behavioral medicine and the care ofindividuals surviving with cancer: a commentary on "Peer mentors delivering aphysical activity intervention for cancer survivors: effects among mentors byPinto et al."Rini C(1)(2), Graves KD(2), O'Neill SC(3), Tercyak KP(2).Author information: (1)Department of Biomedical Research, John Theurer Cancer Center, HackensackUniversity Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA.(2)Cancer Prevention and Control Program, Georgetown Lombardi ComprehensiveCancer Center, Washington, DC, USA.(3)Breast Cancer Program, Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center,Washington, DC, USA.There is a critical gap between the resources available to promote health andwellness after cancer and services that address these public health goals.Researchers, policy makers, healthcare providers, and community stakeholdersincreasingly recognize the benefits of filling this gap with trained peer mentorswho can provide health-promotion services to fellow cancer survivors. Thiscommentary addresses a mixed-method study by Pinto and colleagues thatinvestigated the responses and experiences of trained peer mentors who delivered their telephone-based physical activity intervention for breast cancer survivors.Their findings suggested that peer mentors did not experience harms from theirrole while revealing that peer mentors reported benefits related to helpingthemselves and helping others. Drawing on our expertise in peer support provisionand peer mentoring, we address the significant opportunity offered by trainingpeer mentors to deliver behavioral interventions, draw connections to relevantliteratures and theoretical perspectives on potential benefits for peer mentors, and highlight the need for rigorous, theory-based research to determine thecircumstances under which peer mentoring benefits mentors and the mechanismsunderlying these benefits.DOI: 10.1093/tbm/iby004 PMID: 29474729
