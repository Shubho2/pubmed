Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chicago,Illinois, USA.(4)The University of Chicago, Department of Surgery, Chicago, Illinois, USA.Immune checkpoint inhibitors produce modest responses in metastatic breastcancer, however, combination approaches may improve responses. A single arm pilotstudy was designed to determine the overall response rate (ORR) of durvalumab andtremelimumab, and evaluate immunogenomic dynamics in metastatic endocrinereceptor (ER) positive or triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Simon two-stagedesign indicated at least four responses from the first 18 patients were neededto proceed with the second stage. T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing andimmune-gene expression profiling were conducted at baseline and two months, wholeexome sequencing was conducted at baseline. Eighteen evaluable patients wereaccrued (11 ER-positive; seven TNBC). Only three patients had a response (ORR =17%), thus the study did not proceed to the second stage. Responses were onlyobserved in patients with TNBC (ORR = 43%). Responders versus non-responders had upregulation of CD8, granzyme A, and perforin 1 gene expression, and highermutational and neoantigen burden. Patients with TNBC had an oligoclonal shift of the most abundant TCR-beta clonotypes compared to those with ER-positive disease,p = 0.004. We conclude responses are low in unselected metastatic breast cancer, however, higher rates of clinical benefit were observed in TNBC. Immunogenomicdynamics may help identify phenotypes most likely to respond to immunotherapy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24867 PMCID: PMC5922371PMID: 29721177
