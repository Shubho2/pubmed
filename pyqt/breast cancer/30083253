We investigated the in vitro and in vivopreclinical activity of KW-2450 plus lapatinib and letrozole and conducted aphase I trial of the triple-drug combination in one male and 10 postmenopausalfemale patients with advanced/metastatic hormone receptor-positive, humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer.Methods: A series of in vitro and in vivo animal studies was undertaken ofKW-2450 in combination with lapatinib and hormonal agents. The phase I trial was conducted to establish the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase II dose(RP2D) of KW-2450 administered in combination with lapatinib and letrozole.Results: Preclinical studies showed KW-2450 and lapatinib act synergistically to induce in vitro apoptosis and inhibit growth of HER2-positive MDA-MB-361 andBT-474 breast cancer cell lines. This combined effect was confirmed in vivo usingthe MDA-MB-361 xenograft model. KW-2450 showed synergistic in vitro growthinhibition with letrozole and 4-hydroxytamoxifen in ER-positive MCF-7 breastcancer cells and MCF-7-Ac1 aromatase-transfected MCF-7 cells. In the phase Istudy, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT; grade 3 rash and grade 3 hyperglycemia,respectively) occurred in two of three patients at the dose of KW-2450 25 mg/day plus lapatinib 1500 mg/day and letrozole 2.5 mg/day. The RP2D of the triple-drug combination was established as KW-2450 25 mg/day, lapatinib 1250 mg/day, andletrozole 2.5 mg/day with no DLT at this dose level.Conclusions: The proposed phase II study of the RP2D for the triple-drugcombination did not progress because of anticipated difficulty in patientenrollment and further clinical development of KW-2450 was terminated.DOI: 10.1177/1758835918786858 PMCID: PMC6066809PMID: 30083253
