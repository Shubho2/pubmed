[Epub ahead of print]Inhibition of breast cancer cell growth by the combination of clofarabine andsulforaphane involves epigenetically mediated CDKN2A upregulation.Lubecka K(1), Kaufman-Szymczyk A(1), Fabianowska-Majewska K(1)(2).Author information: (1)a Department of Biomedical Chemistry , Medical University of Lodz , Lodz ,Poland.(2)b Faculty of Medicine , Lazarski University , Warsaw , Poland.Many antineoplastic nucleoside analogue-based combinatorial strategies focused onremodelling aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been developed. The number of studies demonstrate high efficacy of bioactive phytochemicals in support ofconventional chemotherapy. Our recent discoveries of the epigenetic effects ofclofarabine (2'-deoxyadenosine analogue, antileukaemic drug) andclofarabine-based combinations with dietary bioactive compounds in breast cancer cells led us to look for more DNA methylation targets of these cancer-preventive agents. In the present study, using methylation-sensitive restriction analysis(MSRA) and qPCR, we showed that clofarabine in combination with sulforaphane, aphytochemical from cruciferous vegetables, significantly reactivates DNAmethylation-silenced CDKN2A tumour suppressor and inhibits cancer cell growth at a non-invasive breast cancer stage.DOI: 10.1080/15257770.2018.1453075 PMID: 29634384
