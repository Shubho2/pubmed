In the current study, two O-naphthoquinons (mansonone-G and mansonone-N) and six coumarins (mansorin-A, mansorin-B, mansorin-C, mansorins-I, mansorin-II, and mansorin-III) were isolated from the heartwood of Mansonia gageifamily Sterculariaceae. Isolated compounds were examined for their potentialanticancer activity against breast (MCF-7), cervix (HeLa), colorectal (HCT-116)and liver (HepG2) cancer cells using Sulfarhodamine-B (SRB) assay. Mansorin-IIand mansorin-III showed relatively promising cytotoxic profile in all cell lines under investigation with inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the range of 0.74&micro;M to 36 &micro;M and 3.95 &micro;M to 35.3 &micro;M, respectively. Inaddition, mansorin-B, mansorin-C, mansorin-II and mansorin-III significantlyincreased cellular entrapment of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate,doxorubicin, in colorectal cancer cells expressing the P-gp pump. The inhibitory effect of the isolated compounds on P-gp pump was examined using humanrecombinant P-gp molecules attached to ATPase subunit. Mansorin-B and mansonone-Gwere found to inhibit the P-gp attached ATPase subunit. On the other hand,mansorin-C, mansorin-III and mansorin-II inhibited P-gp pump via dual action(P-gp related ATPase subunit inhibition and P-gp substrate binding siteoccupation). However, mansorin II was examined for its potential chemomodulatory effect to paclitaxel (PTX) against colorectal cancer cells (HCT-116 and CaCo-2). Mansorin-II significantly reduced the IC50 of PTX in HCT-116 cells from 27.9&plusmn; 10.2 nM to 5.1 &plusmn; 1.9 nM (synergism with combination index of0.44). Additionally, Mansorin-II significantly reduced the IC50 of PTX in CaCo-2 cells from 2.1 &plusmn; 0.8 &micro;M to 0.13 &plusmn; 0.03 &micro;M (synergismwith combination index of 0.18). Furthermore, cell cycle analysis was studiedafter combination of mansorin-II with paclitaxel using DNA flow cytometryanalysis. Synergism of mansorin-II and PTX was reflected in increasing apoptotic cell population in both HCT-116 and CaCo-2 cells compared to PTX treatment alone.Combination of mansorin-II with PTX in CaCo-2 cells significantly increased thecell population in G₂/M phase (from 2.9 &plusmn; 0.3% to 7.7 &plusmn; 0.8%) with reciprocal decrease in G₀/G1 cell fraction from 52.1 &plusmn; 1.1% to 45.5&plusmn; 1.0%. Similarly in HCT-116 cells, mansorin-II with PTX significantlyincreased the cell population in G₂/M phase (from 33.4 &plusmn; 2.8% to 37.6&plusmn; 1.3%) with reciprocal decrease in the S-phase cell population from 22.8 &plusmn; 1.7% to 20.2 &plusmn; 0.8%. In conclusion, mansorin-II synergizes theanticancer effect of paclitaxel in colorectal cancer cells, which might bepartially attributed to enhancing its cellular entrapment via inhibiting P-gpefflux pump.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23051020 PMID: 29701706
