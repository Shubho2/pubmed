[Epub ahead of print]Prospective study of serial 18F-FDG PET and 18F-fluoride (18F-NaF) PET to predicttime to skeletal related events, time-to-progression, and survival in patientswith bone-dominant metastatic breast cancer.Peterson LM(1), O'Sullivan J(2), Wu QV(3), Novakova-Jiresova A(1), Jenkins I(3), Lee JH(1), Shields A(1), Montgomery S(4), Linden HM(1), Gralow JR(1), Gadi VK(1),Muzi M(1), Kinahan PE(1), Mankoff DA(5), Specht JM(1).Author information: (1)University of Washington, United States.(2)University College Cork, Ireland.(3)Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, United States.(4)Swedish Cancer Institute, United States.(5)University of Pennsylvania, United States.Assessing therapy response of breast cancer bone metastases is challenging. Inretrospective studies, serial 18F-FDG PET was predictive of time to skeletalrelated events (tSRE) and time-to-progression (TTP). 18F-NaF PET improves bonemetastasis detection compared to bone scans. We prospectively tested 18F-FDG PET and 18F-NaF PET to predict tSRE, TTP, and overall survival (OS) in patients with bone-dominant metastatic breast cancer (BD MBC). Methods: Patients with BD MBCwere imaged with 18F-FDG PET and 18F-NaF PET prior to starting new therapy(scan1) and again at a range of times centered around approximately 4 monthslater (scan2). SUVmax and SULpeak were recorded for a single index lesion and up to 5 most dominant lesions for each scan. tSRE, TTP, and OS were assessedexclusive of the PET images. Univariate Cox regression was performed to test the association between clinical endpoints and 18F-FDG PET and 18F-NaF PET measures. mPERCIST (Modified PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria were alsoapplied. Survival curves for mPERCIST compared response categories of CompleteResponse+Partial Response+Stable Disease versus Progressive Disease (CR+PR+SD vs PD) for tSRE, TTP, and OS. Results: Twenty-eight patients were evaluated. Higher FDG SULpeak at scan2 predicted shorter time to tSRE (P = <0.001) and TTP (P =0.044). Higher FDG SUVmax at scan2 predicted a shorter time to tSRE (P = <0.001).A multivariable model using FDG SUVmax of the index lesion at scan1 plus thedifference in SUVmax of up to 5 lesions between scans was predictive for tSRE andTTP. Among 24 patients evaluable by 18F-FDG PET mPERCIST, tSRE and TTP werelonger in responders (CR, PR, or stable) compared to non-responders (PD) (P =0.007, 0.028 respectively), with a trend toward improved survival (P = 0.1). Anincrease in the uptake between scans of up to 5 lesions by 18F-NaF PET wasassociated with longer OS (P = 0.027). Conclusion: Changes in 18F-FDG PETparameters during therapy are predictive of tSRE and TTP, but not OS. mPERCISTevaluation in bone lesions may be useful in assessing response to therapy and is worthy of evaluation in multicenter, prospective trials. Serial 18F-NaF PET wasassociated with OS, but was not useful for predicting TTP or tSRE in BD MBC.Copyright Â© 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.211102 PMID: 29748233
