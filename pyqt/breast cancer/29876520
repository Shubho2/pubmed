Here we describe our recent findings that PRMT5 is a criticalregulator of breast cancer stem cell survival via the epigenetic regulation ofFOXP1. Consequently, PRMT5 inhibitors could potentially eradicate cancer stemcells thereby preventing tumour relapse.DOI: 10.1080/23723556.2018.1441628 PMCID: PMC5964458PMID: 29876520
