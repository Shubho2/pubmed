Epub 2018 Mar 25.Cancer risk in patients with alopecia areata: a nationwide population-basedmatched cohort study.Chen CC(1)(2)(3), Chang YT(2)(3), Liu HN(2)(3), Chen YJ(1)(2)(4).Author information: (1)Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.(2)Department of Dermatology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.(3)Department of Dermatology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.(4)Department of Dermatology, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung,Taiwan.Alopecia areata (AA) is an organ-specific autoimmune disorder. Defective immunesystem related disorders are prone to increase the risk of cancer formation.However, the association among AA and variety of cancer types had never beenstudied. A nationwide population-based matched cohort study was conducted toevaluate the cancer risk in patients with AA. Records from Taiwan National HealthInsurance Research Database were analyzed. Cases of AA from 1997 to 2013 andcancers registered in the catastrophic illness profile from the same time period were collected. The standard incidence ratio (SIR) of each cancer was calculated.In total, 2099 cancers among 162,499 patients with AA and without prior cancerswere identified. The overall cancer risks in AA patients were slightly decreased,especially among male subjects (SIR: 0.89). Refer to individual cancer, thecancer risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (SIR: 0.59), upper GI cancer (SIR: 0.70), liver cancer (SIR: 0.82), uterine, and cervix cancer (SIR: 0.84) weresignificantly lower in patients with AA. In contrast, AA patients were inclinedto have lymphoma, breast cancer, kidney, and urinary bladder cancer with the SIR of 1.55, 2.93, and 2.95, respectively. Age stratified analyses revealed female AApatients younger than 50 years old have even higher risk of breast cancer (SIR:3.37). Further sensitivity analysis showed similar results after excluding major autoimmune disorders. Cancer risk in AA patients is organ specific, and it is notassociated with the underlying autoimmune disorders in patients with AA.© 2018 The Authors.
