The present article reports the first study of taselisibadministration in Japanese patients. The aim of this 2-stage, phase I,multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study was to evaluate the safety,pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of taselisib as monotherapy inJapanese patients with advanced solid tumors (stage 1), and as part ofcombination therapy in Japanese patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positivelocally advanced or recurrent breast cancer (stage 2). In stage 1, oral taselisibtablets 2, 4, and 6 mg/d were given in 28-day cycles. In stage 2, successivecohorts of patients received oral taselisib tablets (2 or 4 mg/d) with i.m.fulvestrant 500 mg. Nine and 6 patients were enrolled in stage 1 and stage 2,respectively. Taselisib was well tolerated. No dose-limiting toxicities wereexperienced in any cohort of patients and no deaths were observed. The mostcommon treatment-related adverse events in stage 1 and stage 2, respectively,were rash (55.6%, 66.7%), diarrhea (44.4%, 66.7%), and stomatitis (44.4%, 66.7%).Taselisib was rapidly absorbed after dosage; its half-life was 12.9-32.0 hours instage 1 and 16.1-26.5 hours in stage 2. Two patients achieved partial response(PR), 5 patients had stable disease (SD) and 2 patients had progressive disease(PD) in stage 1, and 1 patient had PR and 3 patients had SD in stage 2. Allpatients with PR were positive for PIK3CA gene mutations. These preliminary data suggest that taselisib may be effective in patients with PIK3CA-mutated solidtumors or HR-positive advanced breast cancer.© 2018 The Authors.
