This subgroup analysis evaluated PFS in Asian (randomized in China, Japan, orTaiwan) and non-Asian patients from the FALCON study.METHODS: Eligible patients (estrogen receptor- and/or progesteronereceptor-positive LA/MBC; World Health Organization performance status 0-2; ≥ 1measurable/non-measurable lesion[s]) were randomized. PFS was assessed viaResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1, surgery/radiotherapyfor disease worsening, or death (any cause). Secondary endpoints included:objective response rate, clinical benefit rate, duration of response, andduration of clinical benefit. Consistency of effect across subgroups was assessedvia hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a log-rank test.Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated.RESULTS: Of the 462 randomized patients, the Asian and non-Asian subgroupscomprised 67 and 395 patients, respectively. In the Asian subgroup, median PFSwas 16.6 and 15.9 months with fulvestrant and anastrozole, respectively (hazardratio 0.81; 95% CI 0.44-1.50). In the non-Asian subgroup, median PFS was 16.5 and13.8 months, respectively (hazard ratio 0.79; 95% CI 0.62-1.01). Secondaryoutcomes were numerically improved with fulvestrant vs anastrozole in bothsubgroups. AE profiles were generally consistent between Asian and non-Asiansubgroups.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this subgroup analysis suggest that treatment effects in the Asian patient subgroup are broadly consistent with the non-Asian population.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0838-8 PMID: 29450827
