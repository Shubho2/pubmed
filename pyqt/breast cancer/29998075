The nipple areola complex/flap viability wereanalysed intraoperatively through the use of laser assisted indocyanine green(ICG) fluorescent angiography.Results: A total of 44 procedures were followed-up for 24 months. Nineteenpatients were assisted in DTI breast reconstruction by acellular dermal matrix(ADM) for inferior/lateral part of the implant coverage. Encouraging results are presented with a unique case of implant failure.Conclusions: We report our retrospective experience corroborated byintraoperative laser assisted ICG fluorescent angiography to demonstrate thesafety and reliability of the oncoplastic procedure proposed. We also advocatethe central role of oncoplastic surgeon as "one man band" to manage breast cancerfrom the oncological procedure to the breast reconstruction.DOI: 10.21037/gs.2018.04.03 PMCID: PMC6006022PMID: 29998075
