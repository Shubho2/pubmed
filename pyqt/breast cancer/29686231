Most of these recurrent patients receive chemotherapy, but theirchemosensitivity is unknown. Here, we report that tamoxifen-resistant breastcancer cells express significantly more BARD1 and BRCA1, leading to resistance toDNA-damaging chemotherapy including cisplatin and adriamycin, but not topaclitaxel. Silencing BARD1 or BRCA1 expression or inhibition of BRCA1phosphorylation by Dinaciclib restores the sensitivity to cisplatin intamoxifen-resistant cells. Furthermore, we show that activated PI3K/AKT pathwayis responsible for the upregulation of BARD1 and BRCA1. PI3K inhibitors decrease the expression of BARD1 and BRCA1 in tamoxifen-resistant cells and re-sensitizethem to cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo. Higher BARD1 and BRCA1 expression isassociated with worse prognosis of early breast cancer patients, especially theonesÂ that received radiotherapy, indicating the potential use of PI3K inhibitors to reverse chemoresistance and radioresistance in ER-positive breast cancerpatients.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03951-0 PMCID: PMC5913295PMID: 29686231
