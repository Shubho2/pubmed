All participantsreceived usual care, namely, preoperative education and provision of an educationbooklet with postsurgical exercises. The PSTP group was monitored for armmorbidity every three months and referred for physiotherapy if arm morbidity was identified. The EDU group received three education sessions on nutrition, stress and fatigue management.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Arm morbidity was based on changes in the surgical arm(s) from presurgery in four domains: (1) shoulder range of motion, (2) strength, (3) volume, and (4) upper body function. Complex arm morbidity indicated ≥2 domainsimpaired. Second, the cost of the PSTP program was described.RESULTS: At 12 months, 18 (49%) participants (10 PSTP and 8 EDU) had armmorbidity, with EDU participants presenting more complex arm morbidity comparedto PSTP participants. PSTP participants attended 4.4 of 5 assessments with 90%retention. The PSTP program cost was $150 covered by the Health Care Provider andthe Patient Out-of-Pocket Travel cost was CAN$40.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that PSTP is feasible among women with breastcancer for early identification of arm morbidity. A larger study is needed todetermine the cost and effectiveness benefits.DOI: 10.1177/0269215518757292 PMID: 29473482
