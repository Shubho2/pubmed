China.Micro (mi)RNAs are an endogenous non-coding small RNA comprised of 19-26nucleotides. miRNAs regulate gene expression through the recognition of its 'seedsequence' and interactions with 3'-untranslated region of target miRNAs. Previousstudies identified that miRNAs are associated with the onset and development ofbreast cancer and that a number of mutations in the coding DNA sequence of miRNAsaffect its expression. Therefore, the present study aimed to screendifferentially expressed miRNAs using miRNA expression profile chips to analyzethe expression of miRNA (miR)-205 in 12 breast cell lines of different metastaticperformance and benign proliferative variation as well as breast cancer viain-situ hybridization, and screen out single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) inthe miR-205 coding gene region. In addition, the association between SNP and the clinicopathological features of breast lesions was investigated. The results ofthe present study demonstrated that the expression of miR-205 was decreased inbreast cancer cells and tissues compared with benign lesions. SNPs in the miR-205coding gene region were identified in tumor cell lines and as increasing lengths of the AGC repetitive sequence were lost, miR-205 expression increased. Anassociation was identified between a number of SNPs in the miR-205 coding generegion and breast cancer, as well as between SNPs in miR-205 coding gene regionand the clinicopathological features of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7550 PMCID: PMC5776920PMID: 29434917
