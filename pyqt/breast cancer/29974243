MDM2 binding protein (MTBP) in human has a role in G1 phase (interphase of cell cycle) and its overexpression leads to breast and ovariancancers. Sld7 is an uncharacterized protein in budding yeast and a potentialfunctional homologue of MTBP. To investigate the role of Sld7 as a therapeutictarget, the behavior of the wild-type cells and sld7∆ mutants were monitored in0.5 nL microbioreactors. The brightfield microscopy images were used to analyzethe change in the cell size and to determine the durations of G1 and S/G2/Mphases of wild type cells and mutants. With the administration of the alkylating agent, the cell size decreased and the duration of cell cycle increased. Thereplacement of the medium with the fresh one enabled the cells to repair theirDNA. The application of calorie restriction together with DNA alkylating agent tomutant cells resulted in smaller cell size and longer G1 phase compared to those in control environment. For therapeutic purposes, the potential of MTBP in humansor Sld7 in yeast as a drug target deserves further exploration. The fabricationsimplicity, robustness and low-cost of this microfluidic bioreactor made ofpolystyrene allowed us to perform yeast culturing experiments and show apotential for further cell culturing studies. The device can successfully be usedfor therapeutic applications including the discovery of new anti-microbial,anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer drugs.DOI: 10.1007/s10544-018-0302-8 PMID: 29974243
