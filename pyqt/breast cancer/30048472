SerummicroRNAs (miRNAs), with the characteristics of high sensitivity and specificity,have recently attracted more attentions to serve as potential biomarkers fortumor diseases. In this study, 194 breast cancer patients' serum samples werecollected before surgery and enrolled into different groups based on theirdiagnostic information. To search for breast cancer diagnostic biomarkers, serum miRNAs were screened by microarray in pooled samples of healthy volunteers andbreast cancer patients in different clinical stages. The miRNAs were furtherverified in each individual patient's serum samples in diagnostic and predictive sets. The serum level of miR-1915-3p was upregulated and miR-455-3p wasdownregulated significantly in breast cancer patients compared with healthyvolunteers. Furthermore, the patients with infiltrating carcinoma or lymph nodemetastasis had a higher serum level of miR-1915-3p and lower serum level ofmiR-455-3p than patients with the carcinoma in situ or patients without lymphnode metastasis. ROC analysis suggested that miR-1915-3p and miR-455-3p had thepotential as a promising serum diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of breastcancer. miR-1915-3p was over-expressed in certain human breast cancer cells.Functional experiments in vitro showed that miR-1915-3p enhanced cellproliferative and migrational abilities. Overexpression of miR-1915-3p repressed target gene DUSP3 and activated ERK1/2. Collectively, this study provided a newinsight that miR-1915-3p might play a role in the development of breast cancerand that serum miR-1915-3p and miR-455-3p could serve as diagnostic andpredictive biomarkers for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200716 PMCID: PMC6062026PMID: 30048472
