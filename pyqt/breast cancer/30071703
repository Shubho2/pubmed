Thus,the environment-epigenetic alteration-cancer occurrence (EEC) hypothesis has beensuggested. This paper reviews the trends in research supporting this hypothesisfor radiation exposure and onco-viral infection. If more evidences accumulate forthe EEC hypothesis from future research, those findings may greatly aid in theprevention, early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the thyroid cancer andbreast cancer.DOI: 10.3961/jpmph.18.070 PMID: 30071703
