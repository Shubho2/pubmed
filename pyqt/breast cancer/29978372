Nomograms for NSLN metastasis and four or more ALNmetastases were constructed using these parameters, and their area under thereceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the validation set were both0.70, with a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of previously reportedpostoperative nomograms.CONCLUSIONS: We constructed intraoperative nomograms using OSNA for theprediction of NSLN metastasis and four or more ALN metastases. These nomogramsare as accurate as the conventional postoperative nomograms and might be helpful for decision making regarding the indication for cALND or the choice of adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens and radiation field.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6633-0 PMID: 29978372
