We present a case ofskin metastases from the submandibular gland that was mistaken for basal cellcarcinoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case ofsalivary duct carcinoma arising from the submandibular gland with cutaneousmetastases.DOI: 10.1159/000485371 PMCID: PMC5803712PMID: 29422843
