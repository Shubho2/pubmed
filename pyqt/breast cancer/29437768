The approval was based on a randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled, international clinical trial (MONALEESA-2). A total of 668patients were randomized to receive either ribociclib plus letrozole (n = 334) orplacebo plus letrozole (n = 334). An improvement in progression-free survival(PFS) was observed in patients receiving ribociclib plus letrozole compared with patients receiving placebo plus letrozole [HR = 0.556; 95% confidence interval(CI), 0.429-0.720]. Overall response rate (ORR) in patients with measurabledisease was 52.7% (95% CI, 46.6-58.9) in the ribociclib plus letrozole arm and37.1% (95% CI, 31.1-43.2) in the placebo plus letrozole arm. Overall survivaldata were immature. The most common adverse reactions observed in 20% or more of patients taking ribociclib were neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea,leukopenia, alopecia, vomiting, constipation, headache, and back pain. Thisarticle summarizes FDA decision-making and data supporting the approval ofribociclib.
