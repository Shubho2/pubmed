Most STZ regimens for pNET are daily and alsoinclude 5-fluorouracil (5FU), whereas STZ monotherapy and weekly regimens havealso been applied in daily practice in Japan. The present study aimed to evaluateresponses to weekly regimens and to STZ monotherapy, and to identify a predictivemarker of a response to STZ.METHODS: Clinical data regarding STZ-based chemotherapy for pNET were collectedbetween 2015 and 2017 at 25 facilities. We analyzed the effects, safety,progression-free survival (PFS), and factors that correlate with responses toSTZ.RESULTS: The overall objective response rate (ORR) of 110 patients who underwent STZ-based chemotherapy (monotherapy, 81.8%; weekly regimen 46.4%) was 21.8%, and PFS was 9.8 months. The ORR of weekly vs. daily regimens was 21.6 vs. 22.0%(P = 1.000), and that of monotherapy vs. combination therapy was 21.1 vs. 25.0%(P = 0.766). A Ki67 proliferation index (Ki67) of > 5% was a predictive marker ofa response to STZ (P = 0.017), whereas regimen type, mono- or combinationtherapy, treatment line and liver tumor burden were not associated withresponses. The frequencies of Grade ≥ 3 nausea and hematological adverse eventswere significantly lower for monotherapy than combination therapy (P = 0.032).CONCLUSIONS: The effects of weekly STZ monotherapy on pNET are comparable tothose previously reported and the toxicity profile was acceptable. Ki67 > 5% was the sole predictive marker of an objective response.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3656-y PMID: 30054710
