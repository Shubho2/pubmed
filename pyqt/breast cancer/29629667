Egypt.For further exploration of the promising pyrrolizine scaffold and in continuationof our previous work, that proved the potential anticancer activity of the hitcompound I, a new series of pyrrolizines 2-5 and 7-9 were designed andsynthesized. Structures of the new compounds were confirmed by IR, 1H-NMR,13C-NMR and elemental analysis. Antitumor activity for the prepared compoundsagainst human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), liver (HEPG2) and colon (HCT116)cancer cell lines was evaluated using SRB assay method. Compounds 2, 3 and 5 werethe most potent on colon cancer cells, their IC50 values were less than 5 µM.Compounds 2, 3 and 8 were the most potent on liver cancer cells, their IC50values were less than 10 µM. As for MCF7, compounds 2, 7, 8 and 9 were the mostactive with IC50 values less than 10 µM. We can conclude that combiningpyrrolizine scaffold with urea gave abroad spectrum anticancer agent 2 againstthe three tested cell lines. Micronucleus assays showed that compounds 2, 3, 8are mutagenic and can induce apoptosis. In addition, caspase-3 activation wasevaluated and compound 2 showed increase in the level of caspase-3 (9 folds)followed by 3 (8.28 folds) then 8 (7.89 folds). The obtained results encourageconsidering these three compounds as novel anticancer prototypes.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1871520618666180409155520 PMID: 29629667
