The authors hypothesized that propofol is lessimmunosuppressive than volatile anesthetics. The objective of this randomizedtrial was to compare the changes in cluster of differentiation 39 and 73expression on regulatory T cells between propofol- and sevoflurane-basedanesthesia during breast cancer surgery.METHODS: A total of 201 patients having breast cancer surgery were randomlyassigned and analyzed (n = 99 for propofol, n = 102 for sevoflurane). Bloodsamples were obtained immediately before anesthesia induction and 1 and 24 hpostoperatively. The frequency of cluster of differentiation 39 and 73 expressionon circulating regulatory T cells (primary outcome) and the frequency ofcirculating type 1 and type 17 helper T cells, natural killer cells, andcytotoxic T cells were investigated. Serum cytokines and theneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were also evaluated.RESULTS: Changes in cluster of differentiation 39 and 73 expression on regulatoryT cells over time did not differ with propofol and sevoflurane groups (difference[95% confidence interval]: 0.01 [-2.04 to 2.06], P = 0.995 for cluster ofdifferentiation 39; -0.93 [-3.12 to 1.26], P = 0.403 for cluster ofdifferentiation 73). There were no intergroup differences in type 1, type 17helper T cells, natural killer cells, cytotoxic T cells, cytokines, or theneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio.CONCLUSIONS: Changes in immune cells were similar with propofol and sevofluraneduring breast cancer surgery. The effect of anesthetics on the perioperativeimmune activity may be minimal during cancer surgery.DOI: 10.1097/ALN.0000000000002382 PMID: 30074934
