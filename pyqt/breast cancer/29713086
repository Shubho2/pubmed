HR also repairs DNA lesionscaused by platinum agents and PARP inhibitors. Triple-negative breast cancers(TNBCs) harbor subpopulations with BRCA1/2 mutations, hypothesized to beespecially platinum-sensitive. Cancers in putative 'BRCAness' subgroups-tumorswith BRCA1 methylation; low levels of BRCA1 mRNA (BRCA1 mRNA-low); or mutational signatures for HR deficiency and those with basal phenotypes-may also besensitive to platinum. We assessed the efficacy of carboplatin and anothermechanistically distinct therapy, docetaxel, in a phase 3 trial in subjects with unselected advanced TNBC. A prespecified protocol enabled biomarker-treatmentinteraction analyses in gBRCA-BC and BRCAness subgroups. The primary endpoint wasobjective response rate (ORR). In the unselected population (376 subjects; 188carboplatin, 188 docetaxel), carboplatin was not more active than docetaxel (ORR,31.4% versus 34.0%, respectively; P = 0.66). In contrast, in subjects withgBRCA-BC, carboplatin had double the ORR of docetaxel (68% versus 33%,respectively; biomarker, treatment interaction P = 0.01). Such benefit was notobserved for subjects with BRCA1 methylation, BRCA1 mRNA-low tumors or a highscore in a Myriad HRD assay. Significant interaction between treatment and thebasal-like subtype was driven by high docetaxel response in the nonbasalsubgroup. We conclude that patients with advanced TNBC benefit fromcharacterization of BRCA1/2 mutations, but not BRCA1 methylation or Myriad HRDanalyses, to inform choices on platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally,gene expression analysis of basal-like cancers may also influence treatmentselection.DOI: 10.1038/s41591-018-0009-7 PMID: 29713086
