Due to the ambiguity of the existence in thisregard, the study examined the trace element serum levels in women with breastcancer before and after chemotherapy .Methods: Sixty patients were studied undergoing specialist. First sampling wastaken before chemotherapy (after 4 weeks of surgery) and second sampling wastaken after the completion of 3 courses of chemotherapy, approximately 9 weeksafter the first chemotherapy. The patients took Adriamycin 60mg/m2 Cytoxan600mg/m2. Serum zinc and iron levels were measured using standardspectrophotometric method. Measurement of serum copper was done by atomicabsorption spectroscopy.Results: Serum zinc and iron levels in women after chemotherapy significantlydecreased (p<0.001), however, the serum level of copper increased but was notsignificant (P=0.676).Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate significant decrease in zinc and ironlevels in breast cancer patients after 3 courses of Adriamycin and Cytoxanchemotherapy. Prescribing zinc supplements can be useful after chemotherapy.DOI: 10.22088/cjim.9.2.134 PMCID: PMC5912220PMID: 29732030
