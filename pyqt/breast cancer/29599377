Most lesions (39.6%) were0.6-1.0 cm in diameter while 3.2% were ≥3.0 cm; fibroadenomas were the mostcommon (46.6%). Eight (14% of 57) cases of atypical ductal hyperplasia wereunderestimated. The positive predictive values (PPVs) of breast imaging reportingand data system (BI-RADS) ultrasound category were 0.6%, 3.4%, 34.8%, 66.2%, and 93.8% for category 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 lesions, respectively. The mean number ofcore specimens was 9.5±8.8; the mean procedure time was 3.4±2.7 min. No residual lesions were found in 94.4% of the 7,480 patients.CONCLUSION: VABB could replace ultrasound-guided core biopsy and surgicalexcisional biopsy for the diagnosis of breast disease and the treatment of benignbreast lesions.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12499 PMID: 29599377  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
