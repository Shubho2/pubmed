Our purpose was to compare theefficacy of these 2 bioptical devices.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed US-VABB on 195 patients with Mammotome 8G or11G in 130 patients and Elite 13G in 65 patients. Of these 195 patients, 95 were submitted to surgery for lumpectomy or mastectomy in case of malignant lesions orof lesions of uncertain malignant potential (B5 and B3), while the remaining 100 were strictly monitored clinically and radiologically for 12 to 24 months.RESULTS: Both the devices showed high absolute sensitivity (96.2% for Mammotomeand 83.3% for Elite), complete sensitivity (98.1% for Mammotome and 90.0% forElite), specificity (92.3% for Mammotome and 94.3% for Elite), and diagnosticaccuracy (99.1% for Mammotome and 95% for Elite), thus fulfilling criteriasuggested by the European guidelines. Total underestimation rate seemed to behigher in the Elite cohort (14.2%) than in the Mammotome cohort (3.4%) (P = .02).However, none of the patients with a benign diagnosis (B2) presented any eventduring the follow-up period.CONCLUSION: US-VABB is an accurate method for sampling breast lesions. Our study did not show large, statistically significant differences in diagnostic accuracy between the Elite and Mammotome systems, except for a slight increase indiagnostic underestimation of benign pathologies when using the Elite.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
