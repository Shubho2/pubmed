We sought to determine the oncologiceffect of a GnRH agonist with chemotherapy for breast cancer patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 1160 patients aged 20 to 40 years with stage I toIII breast cancer who received chemotherapy from 5 hospitals in Korea from 2002to 2012 were reviewed. A GnRH agonist was provided to 406 patients for ovarianprotection during chemotherapy, and 754 patients received chemotherapy withoutovarian protection. An individual score-matching strategy was used to create setsmatched by age, tumor stage, hormone receptor status, neoadjuvant or adjuvantchemotherapy, and institute.RESULTS: Survival analysis by Cox regression showed that the GnRH agonist grouphad better distant metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.59; 95%confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.89) and disease-free survival (HR, 0.72; 95% CI,0.52-0.99) than the chemotherapy-alone group. Among patients with hormonereceptor-positive breast cancer, the benefit was significant for distantmetastasis-free survival (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.99) and disease-free survival (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35-0.96).CONCLUSION: Ovarian protection using a GnRH agonist can be safely considered for premenopausal breast cancer patients for whom chemotherapy is planned.Copyright Â© 2018.
