Breast cancer risk was calculatedusing the Gail Risk Assessment Tool. Perceived and calculated risk levels werecompared. Descriptive statistics and Chi-Square analysis, t-test, MultivariateLinear Regression Analysis, the Logistic Regression Analysis were conducted.RESULTS: A mean of 5 years risk (0.8% ± 0.52) and a mean of lifetime risk (11.03%± 4.46) were computed. It was found that risk of development of breast cancerover the next 5-years period was high for 7.1% of the midwifes and nurses. Thedifference between the breast cancer risk perception level of women and thebreast cancer risk level according to the Gail Model was significant (p<0.01). Itwas determined that the midwives and nurses, who thought that they had high risksfor individual breast cancer, had mammography with a higher frequency (p<0.00)and went to clinics for breast examination on a regular basis (p<0.01).CONCLUSION: Considering the fact that participants were healthcare professionals,the use of clinical breast examination and mammography practices as a preventive behavior by nurses and midwives was lower than expected.PMID: 29905920
