A current comparison with female breast cancer could assist inbridging this gap. Although conflicting data have been reported on male andfemale survival outcomes, data from 1973 through 2005 in the Surveillance,Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program have demonstrated that theimprovement in breast cancer survival in men has fallen behind that of women. As treatment for breast cancer has improved significantly, an updated analysis usinga contemporary population is necessary.MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analysis of SEER data from patients with a diagnosis ofprimary breast cancer from 2005 to 2010 were included. A Cox regression model wasused to examine the association between sex and breast cancer mortality aftercontrolling for prognostic factors, including age, race, marital status, disease stage, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, lymph node involvement, tumorgrade, surgery, and geography. Subgroup analyses were performed by race andstage.RESULTS: We included a total of 289,673 breast cancer cases (2054 men) with adiagnosis from 2005 to 2010. The 5-year survival rate for male patients was lowerthan that for female patients (82.8% vs. 88.5%). After controlling for otherfactors, the risk of death in men was 43% greater than that in women during thefollow-up period (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.61).Similar results were noted in the race and stage subgroup analyses.CONCLUSION: In recent years, male breast cancer patients have had worse survival outcomes compared with those of female patients.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
