China.The present study was performed to investigate the biological functions ofmicroRNA‑320a in human breast cancer and the underlying mechanisms. MicroRNA‑320aexpression was downregulated in human breast cancer, compared with the normalcontrol. Overexpression of microRNA‑320a induced apoptosis, and inhibited cellviability and invasion in MDA‑MB‑231cells while downregulation of microRNA‑320areduced apoptosis, and increased cell viability and invasion in MDA‑MB‑231 cells.Then, overexpression of microRNA‑320a suppressed insulin‑like growth factor 1receptor (IGF‑1R), p‑AKt and cyclin D1 protein expression in MDA‑MB‑231cells. In addition, the downregulation of microRNA‑320a induced IGF‑1R, p‑Akt and cyclin D1protein expression in MDA‑MB‑231cells. Furthermore, the IGF‑1R inhibitorincreased the effects of microRNA‑320a on the apoptosis of MDA‑MB‑231 cells. The p‑Akt inhibitor (MK 2206 dihydrochloride, 2.5 nM) increased the effects ofmicroRNA‑320a on the apoptosis of MDA‑MB‑231 cells. These results revealed thatmicroRNA‑320a suppresses tumor cell growth and invasion of human breast cancer bytargeting IGF‑1R.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6517 PMID: 29989645
