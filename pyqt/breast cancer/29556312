China.Placenta-specific 1 (PLAC1), a novel cancer-testis antigen (CTA), is expressed ina number of different human malignancies. It is frequently produced in breastcancer, serving a function in tumorigenesis. Adoptive immunotherapy using T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells against CTA mediates objective tumorregression; however, to the best of our knowledge, targeting PLAC1 usingengineered T cells has not yet been attempted. In the present study, the cDNAsencoding TCRα- and β-chains specific for human leukocyte antigen(HLA)-A*0201-restricted PLAC1 were cloned from a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte,generated by in vitro by the stimulation of CD8+ T cells using autologous HLA-A2+dendritic cells loaded with a PLAC1-specific peptide (p28-36, VLCSIDWFM). TheTCRα/β-chains were linked by a 2A peptide linker (TCRα-Thosea asigna virus-TCRβ),and the constructs were cloned into the lentiviral vector, followed bytransduction into human cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells. The efficiency of transduction was up to 25.16%, as detected by PLAC1 multimers. TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells,co-cultured with human non-metastatic breast cancer MCF-7 cells (PLAC1+, HLA-A2+)and triple-negative breast cancer MDAMB-231 cells (PLAC1+, HLA-A2+), producedinterferon γ and tumor necrosis factor α, suggesting TCR activation. Furthermore,the PLAC1 TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells efficiently and specifically identified andannihilated the HLA-A2+/PLAC1+ breast cancer cell lines in a lactatedehydrogenase activity assay. Western blot analysis demonstrated that TCRtransduction stimulated the production of mitogen-activated protein kinasesignaling molecules, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and nuclearfactor-κB, through phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ-mediated phosphorylation ofprotein kinase B in CD8+ T cells. Xenograft mouse assays revealed that PLAC1TCR-transduced CD8+T cells significantly delayed the tumor progression inmice-bearing breast cancer compared with normal saline or negativecontrol-transduced groups. In conclusion, a novel HLA-A2-restricted andPLAC1-specific TCR was identified. The present study demonstrated PLAC1 to be apotential target for breast cancer treatment; and the usage of PLAC1-specificTCR-engineered T cells may be a novel strategy for PLAC1-positive breast cancertreatment.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8075 PMCID: PMC5844056PMID: 29556312
