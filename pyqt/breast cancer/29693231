Although the clinical impact ofALDH1 was observed in our previous study, we do not know how ALDH1 affects stemcell features resulting in worsening of prognosis in breast cancer. The purposeof this study is to explore ALDH1-related gene and its function on cancer stemcell (CSC).METHODS: In five cases of ALDH1-positive triple-negative breast cancer, mRNAexpression profile was compared between ALDH1-positive and ALDH1-negative cellsby Affymetrix microarray analysis after microdissection. Among the genesmodulated in ALDH1-positive cells, we focused on H19, which encodes a longnon-coding RNA, in this study. An in-vitro study was conducted with H19 siRNA in HCC1934 and iCSCL10A cell lines. The association of H19 with prognosis wasexamined in 180 breast cancer cases.RESULTS: Network analysis revealed the existence of five genes related with H19, including miR-103, miR-107, let-7, miR-29b-1, and Trx. In-vitro analysis showedthat suppression of H19 using siRNA reduces sphere formation capacity in bothHCC1934 and iCSCL10A cell lines. In clinical studies, H19 expression wasassociated with hormone negativity, tumor size, and nodal status. Patients withH19 expression had significantly poor disease-free survival (DFS) (26.3 vs. 64.8%at 5 years, p = 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (28.9 vs. 68.3% at 5 years,p = 0.004). The effect of H19 expression on prognosis was the most significant intriple-negative breast cancer compared to that in other subtypes (20.0 vs. 65.4% at 5 years DFS, p = 0.012, 20.0 vs. 69.2% at 5 years OS, p = 0.016).CONCLUSION: This study indicated that H19 was associated with stem cell phenotypein ALDH1-positive breast cancer. H19 regulates CSC and is associated with poorprognosis in breast cancer patients, particularly in triple-negative subtype.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4793-z PMID: 29693231
