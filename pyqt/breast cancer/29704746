Current breast cancer survivor upper limb kinematic strategiesunfortunately lack robust connection with performing important activities ofdaily living.METHODS: Accordingly, fifty breast cancer survivors performed 88 dynamic tasks(divided into range of motion-reach, range of motion-rotate, activity of dailyliving, and work tasks). Humerothoracic and scapulothoracic angles were extractedfrom motion capture data. Bilateral differences existed for range of motion, and maximal and minimal scapulothoracic and humerothoracic angles.FINDINGS: Generally, the affected side used less range of motion across tasktypes. Humerothoracic angles on the affected side experienced 6.7° less range of motion in plane of elevation in range of motion-reach (p < 0.01), 2.3° lesselevation angle range of motion in range of motion-rotate (p = 0.01), and 7.1°more internal rotation range of motion in range of motion-rotate (p < 0.01).Scapulothoracic angles on the affected side had 2° more anterior/posterior tiltrange of motion in work tasks (p = 0.03), 3.4° less maximal protraction inactivity of daily living tasks (p = 0.01), and 3.5° less minimum downwardrotation in range of motion-rotate (p < 0.01).INTERPRETATION: A reduced range of motion on the affected side suggests thebreast cancer population had less varied movement strategies, keeping movementsin narrower ranges to avoid disability, pain, or subacromial impingement. Thisinvestigation produced an unprecedentedly diverse collection of three-dimensionalhumerothoracic and scapulothoracic kinematics for a breast cancer population.Documentation of physical capability, dysfunction, and adaptive strategies is acrucial step towards developing targeted strategies for enhancing functionalrecovery in breast cancer survivors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
