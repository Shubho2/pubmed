Combination therapies are usually more effective than monotherapy. Inthis context, the use of cyclic and acyclic O,N-acetals derivative compounds incombination with the suicide gef gene shown a potent anti-tumor activity andrepresent a new generation of anticancer agents. Here, we evaluate the use of thegef gene to promote and increase the anti-tumor effect of cyclic and acyclicO,N-acetals purine derivatives and elucidate their mechanisms of action. Amongall compounds tested, those with a nitro group and a cyclic pattern structures(FC-30b2, FC-29c, and bozepinib) are the most benefited from the gef gene effect.These compounds, in combination with gef gene, were able to abolish tumor cellproliferation with a minimal dose leading to more effective and less toxicchemotherapy. The effect of this combined therapy is triggered by apoptosisinduction which can be found deregulated in the later stage of breast cancer.Moreover, the combined therapy leads to an increase of cell post-apoptoticsecondary necrosis that is able to promote the immunogenicity of cancer cellsleading to a successful treatment. This data suggests that this novel combinationtherapy represents a promising candidate for breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00798 PMCID: PMC6070671PMID: 30093861
