A median follow-up of 29.5 months had been achieved by thedata cutoff date (December 17, 2016).Interventions: Patients received first-line treatment with everolimus, 10 mg/d,plus letrozole, 2.5 mg/d. Second-line treatment with everolimus, 10 mg/d, plusexemestane, 25 mg/d, was offered at the investigator's discretion upon initialdisease progression.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was investigator-assessedprogression-free survival in the first-line setting per Response EvaluationCriteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.0. Safety was assessed in patients whoreceived at least 1 dose of study medication and at least 1 postbaseline safetyassessment.Results: A total of 202 women treated in the first-line setting had a median age of 64.0 years (interquartile range, 58.0-70.0 years) with metastatic (194[96.0%]) or locally advanced (8 [4.0%]) breast cancer. Median progression-freesurvival was 22.0 months (95% CI, 18.1-25.1 months) with everolimus andletrozole. Median overall survival was not reached; 24-month estimated overallsurvival rate was 78.7% (95% CI, 72.1%-83.9%). Fifty patients started second-linetreatment; median progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% CI, 1.9-7.4months). No new safety signals were observed. In the first-line setting, the mostcommon all-grade adverse event was stomatitis (139 [68.8%]); the most commongrade 3 to 4 adverse event was anemia (21 [10.4%]). In the second-line setting,the most common adverse events were stomatitis and decreased weight (10 [20.0%]each); the most common grade 3 to 4 adverse event was hypertension (5 [10.0%]).There were 50 (24.8%) deaths overall during the study; 40 were due to studyindication (breast cancer).Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this trial add to the existing body of evidence suggesting that everolimus plus endocrine therapy is a good first-linetreatment option for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01698918.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.0060 PMCID: PMC5885212PMID: 29566104
