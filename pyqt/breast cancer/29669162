Therefore, the authors developed and validated algorithmsto select DCIS cases from administrative claims data to enable outcomes research in this type of data.METHODS: This retrospective cohort using invasive breast cancer and DCIS casesincluded women aged 66 to 70 years in the 2004 through 2011 Texas Cancer Registry(TCR) data linked to Medicare administrative claims data. TCR records were usedas "gold" standards to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and positivepredictive value (PPV) of 2 algorithms. Women with a biopsy enrolled in Medicare parts A and B at 12 months before and 6 months after their first biopsy without asecond incident diagnosis of DCIS or invasive breast cancer within 12 months inthe TCR were included. Women in 2010 Medicare data were selected to test thealgorithms in a general sample.RESULTS: In the TCR data set, a total of 6907 cases met inclusion criteria, with 1244 DCIS cases. The first algorithm had a sensitivity of 79%, a specificity of89%, and a PPV of 62%. The second algorithm had a sensitivity of 50%, aspecificity of 97%. and a PPV of 77%. Among women in the general sample, thespecificity was high and the sensitivity was similar for both algorithms.However, the PPV was approximately 6% to 7% lower.CONCLUSIONS: DCIS frequently is miscoded as invasive breast cancer, and thus the proposed algorithms are useful to examine DCIS outcomes using data sets notlinked to cancer registries.
