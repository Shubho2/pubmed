Electronic address: sebastiano.ando@unical.it.The detection of recurrent mutations affecting the hormone binding domain (HBD)of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα/ESR1) in endocrine therapy-resistant andmetastatic breast cancers has prompted interest in functional characterization ofthese genetic alterations. Here, we explored the role of HBD-ESR1 mutations ininfluencing the behavior of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), using various BCcell lines stably expressing wild-type or mutant (Y537 N, Y537S, D538G) ERα.Compared to WT-ERα clones, mutant cells showed increased CD44+/CD24- ratio, mRNA levels of stemness genes, Mammosphere Forming Efficiency (MFE), Self-Renewal and migratory capabilities. Mutant clones exhibited high expression of NOTCHreceptors/ligands/target genes and blockade of NOTCH signaling reduced MFE andmigratory potential. Mutant BCSC activity was dependent on ERα phosphorylation atserine 118, since its inhibition decreased MFE and NOTCH4 activation only inmutant cells. Collectively, we demonstrate that the expression of HBD-ESR1mutations may drive BC cells to acquire stem cell traits through ER/NOTCH4interplay. We propose the early detection of HBD-ESR1 mutations as a challenge inprecision medicine strategy, suggesting the development of tailored-approaches(i.e. NOTCH inhibitors) to prevent disease development and metastatic spread inBC mutant-positive patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
