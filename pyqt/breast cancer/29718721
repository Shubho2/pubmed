Areas covered: Lenvatinib is a novelmulti-kinase inhibitor that has been studied in several solid tumors. It hasshown promising results in the treatment of RCC, especially when combined witheverolimus, In this review, we summarize the available data of lenvatinib for thetreatment of advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Expert opinion: Lenvatinibin combination with everolimus has provided encouraging results in both clinical and laboratory investigations showing that blocking angiogenesis and the mTORsignalling pathway could be a remarkable approach for treating RCC. As anadditive to this type of approach it would be interesting in future clinicalsettings testing also the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus withimmune-therapy.DOI: 10.1080/13543784.2018.1472235 PMID: 29718721  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
