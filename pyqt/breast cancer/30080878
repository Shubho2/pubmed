Although theprogesterone receptor (PgR) is also a prognostic factor for ER-positive breastcancer, the PgR status was not considered a prognostic factor in the originalPEPI scoring system. In this study, we investigated the utility of a modifiedPEPI including the PgR status (PEPI-P) as a prognostic factor after NAE forpostmenopausal patients with ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. Weenrolled 107 patients with invasive ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancertreated with exemestane for â‰¥4 months as NAE. We initially assessed PEPI andcompared survival between the groups. Additionally, we obtained an effectivecutoff for PgR through survival analysis. Then, we assessed the survivalsignificance of PEPI-P. A PgR staining rate of 50% was the most significantcutoff for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival(CSS). PEPI was a significant prognostic factor; moreover, PEPI-P was the mostsignificant prognostic indicator for RFS and CSS. PEPI-P is a potent prognosticindicator of survival after NAE using AIs for postmenopausal patients withER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. This modified PEPI may be useful fortherapeutic decision-making regarding postmenopausal ER-positive andHER2-negative breast cancer after NAE.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0201846 PMID: 30080878
