It could be also expressed on epithelial breast cancer cells(EBCCs), but no data have been published regarding the correlation between mastcells positive to c-KitR (MCs-c-KitR), EBCCs positive to c-KitR (EBCCs-c-KitR),BC angiogenesis in terms of microvessel density (MVD) and the mainclinic-pathological features. This study aims to evaluate the above parametersand their correlations in a series of selected 121 female early BC patients. Ithas been found a strong correlation between MVD and MCDPT, and MCs-c-KitR, MVDand MCs density positive to tryptase (MCDPT), and MCs-c-KitR and MCDPT by Pearsoncorrelation. These data suggest an involvement of both MCDPT and MCs-c-KitR in BCtumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, BC tissue expressing c-KitR could be a putative predictive factor to c-KitR-TK inhibitors. In this way, selected patients withhigher MCs-c-KitR could be candidate to receive c-KitR-TK inhibitors (e.g.masitinib, sunitinib) or tryptase inhibitors (e.g. nafamostat mesilate, gabexate mesilate).DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23722 PMCID: PMC5814269PMID: 29487702
