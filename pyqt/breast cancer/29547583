To investigate the preventive effects ofhOCIF, mice were treated with hOCIF before tumor cell implantation onto thecalvaria (Pre), after (Post), and both before and after (Whole). The number ofCSCs and cytokine levels were evaluated by IHC and ELISA assay, respectively.RESULTS: hOCIF suppressed osteolysis, and growth of mammary tumors in theTB-microE, but not in the TS-microE. In the Pre, Post, and Whole groups, hOCIFsuppressed osteolysis, and cell proliferation. hOCIF increased mouseosteoprotegrin (mOPG) levels in vivo, which suppressed mammary tumor cellproliferation in vitro. These preventive effects were observed in thedose-dependent. hOCIF did not affect the induction of CSCs in eithermicroenvironment.CONCLUSION: While receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand (RANKL) targeting therapymay not affect the induction of CSCs, RANKL is a potential target for prevention as well as treatment of breast cancer bone metastasis.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19030888 PMCID: PMC5877749PMID: 29547583
