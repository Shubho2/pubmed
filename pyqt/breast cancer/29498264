Currently, it stillremains a challenge to develop an ideal gene carrier with efficient transfection ability and low toxicity for clinical applications. Herein, we have innovatively introduced a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-biodegradable boric acid ester linkagein elaborating the design of a gene carrier. In virtue of the featuredintracellular characteristics such as the high level of ROS in tumor cells, anROS-biodegradable electropositive polymer derived from branched polyethylenimine (BPEI) with a low molecular weight (1.2k) through a cross-linking reaction by theboric acid ester bond was developed in this study to achieve condensation andescorting of carried genes. Furthermore, the polymer was modified with substance P (SP) peptide as the targeting ligand through polyethylene glycol. The finalfabricated SP-cross-linked BPEI/plasmid DNA nanoparticles exhibit favorablebiocompatibility, ROS-cleavability, and fine targeting ability as well as hightransfection efficiency compared with parental BPEI1.2k both in vitro and invivo. SP-cross-linked BPEI/small interfering RNA (pololike kinase 1) polyplexpossesses favorable gene-silencing effects in vitro and satisfactory antitumorability in vivo. Hopefully, this novel cross-linked electropositive polymer mayserve well as a safe and efficient gene-delivery vehicle in the clinic.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b01712 PMID: 29498264
