Recognized types are sialadenoma papilliferum, invertedductal papilloma, and intraductal papilloma, but some lesions have been possibly included in the morphologic spectrum of cystadenoma or low-grade intraductalcarcinomas. We herein present detailed morphologic, immunophenotypic, andgenotypic features of 3 minor salivary gland neoplasms affecting 2 men (aged 65and 71 y) and 1 woman (aged 78 y). They ranged in size from 1 to 2.5 cm. Alltumors showed atypical papillary intraductal growth that presented either asuninodular/unicystic lesions (intraductal papilloma-like; n=2) or as adiscontinuous growth along the ductal system in a manner similar to pancreaticintraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (n=1). Variable cytologic andarchitectural atypia was observed, ranging from bland intraductal papilloma-like features, to areas mimicking atypical ductal hyperplasia and low-grade ductalcarcinoma in situ of the breast. Amplicon-based massive parallel sequencingrevealed an identical AKT1 p.Glu17Lys mutation in all 3 cases, but absence ofconcurring mutations in other genes of the RAS or PI3K pathway. This small seriesrepresents the first genetic study on salivary intraductal papillary neoplasms.Our cases showed significant variation in the degree of cytologic andarchitectural atypia, which overlaps with intraductal papillomas at the one endand with low-grade intraductal carcinoma at the other end of the spectrum,suggesting a disease continuum. As the full biological and morphologiccharacteristics of these ductal papillary lesions remain to be defined, thenoncommitted term "intraductal papillary neoplasms" might be more appropriate.Our novel genetic findings mirror similar activating mutations of AKT1 and other PI3K pathway members in intraductal papillary lesions of the breast andanogenital glands.DOI: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000001080 PMID: 29738361
