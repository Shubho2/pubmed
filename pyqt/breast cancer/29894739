Electronic address: wangx@sdas.org.Two new alkaloid glycosides (1-2), two new amide alkaloids (3 and 6), and two newamine alkaloids (4 and 5), were isolated from Scindapsus officinalis (Roxb.)Schott., along with four known alkaloids (7-10). Structural elucidation of theisolated compounds was established by spectroscopic analysis, especially 2D NMRtechniques and comparison with literatures. The absolute configurations ofcompounds 1 and 2 were determined by the electronic circular dichroismcalculations. Compound 1 represent the first example of alkaloid glycoside found to possess an unprecedented 2,5-methanocyclopenta[b]azepine core. All isolateswere evaluated for cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 human breast cancer cell and anti-inflammatory activity against nitric oxide (NO) production in vitro.Compounds 4, 6 and 8 demonstrated moderate cytotoxic effects against MCF-7 cell(IC50 of 11.6, 25.3, and 20.5 μM, respectively), and 1, 7 and 9 exhibitedmoderate inhibitory effects on NO production (IC50 of 19.8, 30.3, and 11.8 μM,respectively).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
