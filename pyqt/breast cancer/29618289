[Epub ahead of print]Testing equality of means in partially paired data with incompleteness in single response.Qi Q(1), Yan L(2), Tian L(1)(2).Author information: (1)1 Department of Biostatistics, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.(2)2 Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Roswell Park CancerInstitute, Buffalo, NY, USA.In testing differentially expressed genes between tumor and healthy tissues, dataare usually collected in paired form. However, incomplete paired data oftenoccur. While extensive statistical researches exist for paired data withincompleteness in both arms, hardly any recent work can be found on paired datawith incompleteness in single arm. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing some new methods, namely, P-value pooling methods and a nonparametric combinationtest. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the performance of theproposed methods in terms of type I error and power at small to moderate samplesizes. A real data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer study isanalyzed using the proposed methods.DOI: 10.1177/0962280218765007 PMID: 29618289
