We can distinguish between non-melanoma skin cancers(NMSC), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) and solid organcancers (SOC). Our objective is to determine the incidence of the different typesof NM, the time elapsed until diagnosis and survival rates in our setting.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 1071 liver transplant patientsfrom 1990 to 2015 at our center. We analyzed the demographic variables, incidenceof NM and survival.RESULTS: 184 NM developed in 1071 transplant patients (17%), specifically 19% of the males and 13% of the females (P=.004). The most frequent NM were NMSC (29%), lung (18%), head and neck (16%), PTLD (10%) and gastrointestinal (8%). The mediantime of diagnosis was 7.9 years in NMSC, 3.9 years in PTLD and 9.8 years in SOC. Patients with NMSC had significantly better survival than those with PTLD or SOC.The incidence of de novo tumors (excluding NMSC) was 1889/100,000transplants/year. By gender, lung cancer was the most common TOS in men andbreast cancer in women.CONCLUSION: In our setting, excluding NMSC, the incidence is 8.8 times greaterthan estimations for the general population, with a high rate of lung cancer, so we should implement preventive and diagnostic strategies.Copyright © 2018 AEC.
