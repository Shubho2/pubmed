This study is intended to increase understanding ofthe characteristics of PABC.METHODS: A database of 2,810 patients with breast cancer diagnosed when they wereless than 40 years of age was reviewed. The clinicopathological factors andsurvival of PABC (40 patients) were compared to those of patients with youngbreast cancer (YBC, non-pregnant or over 12 months after delivery; 2,770patients).RESULTS: PABC had significantly lower estrogen receptor (ER) and progesteronereceptor (PR) expression (ER-positive 50.0%, PR-positive 45.0%) and higher HER2overexpression (38.5%) than YBC. The most common subtype of PABC wastriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; 35.9%), and luminal A subtype representedonly 7.7% of cases. In univariate analysis, PABC had significantly worsedisease-free survival (DFS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) comparedto YBC. In multivariate analysis, PABC was associated with worse BCSS (HR 4.0,95% CI 1.2-12.9, p = 0.019) and survival, but there was no difference in DFSbetween PABC and YBC. In subgroup analysis by subtype, luminal B subtype of PABC showed worse DFS (HR 3.5; 95% CI 1.1-11.2, p = 0.039) and BCSS (HR 10.2, 95% CI1.2-87.1, p = 0.035), especially with high Ki67. However, no differences weredemonstrated in other subtypes.CONCLUSION: In this study, PABC showed lower expression of ER/PR, higheroverexpression of HER2, fewer luminal A subtype, and more TNBC subtype comparedto YBC. PABC had worse BCSS, especially luminal B subtype, compared to YBC.Â© 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.DOI: 10.1159/000488944 PMID: 29913459
