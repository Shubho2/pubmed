In this sandwich type immunoassay, CA15-3 antibody-functionalizedcarbon dots and AuNPs labeled PAMAM-Dendrimer/aptamer were used asdonor/acceptor, respectively. When CA 15-3 Ag was added to homogenousimmunoassay, the strong complex interaction between CA15-3 Ab-CA15-3 Ag- aptamer caused in more coming closer carbon dot and AuNPs and more decreasingfluorescence signal. The decreased fluorescence intensity was linear at threeranges including in concentration range 1.1 μUmL-1 to 16 μU mL-1 with regression of R2 = 0.9879, at the concentration range 16 μU mL-1 to 0.163 mU mL-1 withregression of R2 = 0.9944 and at the concentration range 0.163 mU mL-1 to 5.0 mU mL-1 with regression of R2 = 0.9805. The detection limit of the FRET immunoassay was 0.9 μU mL-1. This assay revealed good sensitivity and specificity withMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells concentrations from 1000 to 40000 cells/mL withcorrelation coefficient of 0.9955 and detection limit of 300 cells/mL (3 cells in10 μL of injected sample). In addition, this FRET immunosensing is applicable in diluted human serum. The recovery values were in the range of 95.86-96.97% for CA15-3 Ag in spiked serum sample with RSD lower than 7.3%. The proposed immunoassaycould be a valid model for establishing other immunoassays for detection ofdifferent cancer tumor markers with relevant antigens and antibodies.Copyright © 2018.
