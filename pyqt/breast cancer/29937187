However, its prognostic impact for breast cancer with different molecularsubtypes is still controversial.METHODS: Snail expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in tissuemicroarray slides of 85 corresponding tumor-adjacent normal (CTAN) and 247 breastinvasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tissues. Multivariable Cox regression analysiswas used to assess the impact of Snail expression on survival rate by differentmolecular subtypes of breast IDC patients.RESULTS: The level of Snail expression in IDC tumor tissues was significantlyhigher than that in CTAN tissues. Moreover, high Snail expression had directimpacts on poor disease specific survival (DSS) and disease-free survival (DFS)in breast IDC patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positivestatuses as well as the HER2 intrinsic subtype. Additionally, breast IDC patientswith a combination of three prognostic factors, including high Snail expressionand HER2-positive and EGFR-positive statuses, had much poor DSS and DFS with astatistically significant linear trend.CONCLUSION: High Snail expression could predict a poor prognosis for breast IDCpatients with HER2/EGFR-positive subtypes.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
